## Research-Backed Hypotheses

### H1: Optimal Slide Count Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: Carousels with 8-10 slides will achieve higher engagement rates (2.07%+) compared to 3-slide and 5-slide carousels, but may show lower completion rates.

**Rationale**: Research shows 10-slide carousels achieve 2.07% ER vs 1.9% for 2-slide posts, but completion rates decrease with length.

**Success Criteria**:
- 8-10 slide carousels achieve ER ≥ 2.0%
- ER improvement of ≥15% vs control (single image)
- Completion rate ≥ 40% for 10-slide carousels

---

### H2: First Slide Hook Effectiveness
**Hypothesis**: Specific hook patterns (number hook, before/after, question hook) combined with "swipe left" CTA will increase swipe-through rate by 20%+ compared to generic hooks.

**Rationale**: Including "swipe left" messaging improves ER from 1.83% to 2% (9.3% increase). Compelling hooks are critical for stopping the scroll.

**Success Criteria**:
- Swipe-through rate (STR) ≥ 70% for 3-5 slide carousels
- Swipe-through rate ≥ 50% for 10-slide carousels
- Hook variants show ≥15% STR difference from each other

---

### H3: Saves Acquisition Rate
**Hypothesis**: Educational carousel content will achieve 100%+ higher save rates compared to single-image posts, with 5-7 slide carousels showing optimal save rate per engagement.

**Rationale**: Educational/step-by-step formats are 114% more likely to be saved. Saves are one of Instagram's strongest ranking signals.

**Success Criteria**:
- Carousel save rate ≥ 2x single image baseline
- Save rate correlation with educational content format
- Saves contribute to ≥20% of total engagement

---

## Metrics & Measurement Framework

### Primary Metrics

#### 1. Swipe-Through Rate (STR)
**Definition**: Percentage of viewers who swipe from first slide to last slide

**Calculation**:
```
STR = (Total Swipes / Reach) × 100
```

**Measurement Method**:
- Instagram Insights → Post Details → Interactions → Swipe count
- If slide-by-slide data available, track progression drop-off
- Manual tracking in spreadsheet

**Success Benchmarks**:
- 3-slide carousel: ≥70% STR
- 5-slide carousel: ≥60% STR
- 10-slide carousel: ≥50% STR

---

#### 2. Completion Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of engaged users who reach the final slide

**Calculation**:
```
Completion Rate = (Final Slide Interactions / Total Carousel Interactions) × 100
```

**Measurement Method**:
- Infer from overall engagement patterns
- Track saves/shares (typically happen on last slide with CTA)
- Monitor time spent on post (longer = higher completion)

**Success Benchmarks**:
- 3-slide: ≥72% (research benchmark)
- 5-slide: ≥60%
- 10-slide: ≥40%

---

#### 3. Engagement Rate (ER)
**Definition**: Total interactions per reach

**Calculation**:
```
ER = (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Reach × 100
```

**Success Benchmarks**:
- Single image (control): 1.74% baseline
- Carousel (overall): ≥1.92%
- 10-slide carousel: ≥2.07%
- Target improvement: ≥15% vs control

---

### Secondary Metrics

#### 4. Save Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of viewers who save the post

**Calculation**:
```
Save Rate = (Saves / Impressions) × 100
```

**Success Benchmarks**:
- Carousel save rate ≥2x control
- Educational carousels: ≥114% increase vs control
- Saves should represent ≥20% of total engagement

---

#### 5. Reach
**Definition**: Total unique accounts that saw the post

**Success Benchmarks**:
- Carousel reach ≥1.4x control baseline
- High-performing carousels may achieve 1.9x reach

---

#### 6. Shares & Sends
**Definition**: How many times post was shared to stories or DM'd

**Success Benchmarks**:
- Carousels achieve up to 3x more shares than single images

---

#### 7. Comments
**Definition**: Number of comments on post

**Success Benchmarks**:
- Measure comment quality (length, relevance)
- Track CTA response rate if asking for comments

---

### Composite Metrics

#### 8. Engagement Quality Score (EQS)
**Formula**:
```
EQS = (Saves × 3) + (Shares × 2) + (Comments × 2) + (Likes × 1)
```

**Rationale**: Weight higher-value interactions more heavily (saves/shares signal to algorithm)

---

#### 9. Content Efficiency Ratio
**Formula**:
```
Efficiency = Engagement Rate / Number of Slides
```

**Use**: Identify optimal content density (high engagement per slide invested)

## Data Collection Protocol

### Daily Data Recording

**Create tracking spreadsheet with these columns**:

| Post # | Date | Group | Slides | Hook | Topic | Reach | Impressions | Likes | Comments | Shares | Saves | Swipes | ER | STR | Save Rate |
|--------|------|-------|--------|------|-------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|--------|----|----|-----------|

**Data Collection Timeline**:
- **24 hours post-publish**: Record initial metrics
- **48 hours**: Update with 2-day performance
- **7 days**: Final metric snapshot (Instagram posts get 80%+ engagement in first week)

**Instagram Insights Access**:
1. Go to post
2. Click "View Insights"
3. Record:
   - Accounts Reached
   - Impressions
   - Interactions (Likes, Comments, Shares, Saves)
   - If available: Swipes/Carousel navigation data

---

### Qualitative Data

**Track these observations**:
- Which hook patterns generate most comments
- Type of comments (questions, feedback, objections)
- Save patterns (what content gets saved most)
- Drop-off points (if slide-by-slide data available)
- Audience feedback in DMs
- Story shares and tags

---

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### Analysis Methods

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Calculate for each group:
- Mean ER
- Median ER
- Standard deviation
- Min/Max values
- Sample size: n=5 per group

---

#### 2. Hypothesis Testing

**Test**: Independent samples t-test (comparing group means)

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No significant difference in ER between groups

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Significant difference exists

**Significance Level**: p < 0.05 (95% confidence)

**Formula**:
```
t = (Mean1 - Mean2) / sqrt((SD1²/n1) + (SD2²/n2))
```

**Comparisons to Run**:
1. Control vs Variant A
2. Control vs Variant B
3. Control vs Variant C
4. Variant A vs Variant B vs Variant C (ANOVA)

---

#### 3. Effect Size Calculation

**Cohen's d** (measure of practical significance):
```
d = (Mean1 - Mean2) / Pooled SD
```

**Interpretation**:
- d = 0.2: Small effect
- d = 0.5: Medium effect
- d = 0.8: Large effect

---

#### 4. Correlation Analysis

Test correlations between:
- Slide count ↔ Engagement rate
- Swipe-through rate ↔ Save rate
- Hook pattern ↔ STR
- Completion rate ↔ Total engagement

**Method**: Pearson correlation coefficient (r)

---

### Analysis Tools

**Option 1: Excel/Google Sheets**
- Built-in T.TEST function
- Descriptive statistics functions
- Correlation function
- Charts and graphs

**Option 2: Statistical Software**
- R or Python (scipy.stats)
- More robust for small sample sizes
- Advanced visualizations

---

### Sample Size Considerations

**Limitation**: n=5 per group is small for statistical power

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Use non-parametric tests if data not normally distributed (Mann-Whitney U)
2. Report effect sizes alongside p-values
3. Consider extending test if results inconclusive
4. Focus on practical significance (% improvements) not just statistical significance
5. Use confidence intervals to show uncertainty range
