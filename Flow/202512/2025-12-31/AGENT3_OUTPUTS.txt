RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITY
================================================================================

CRITICAL (Execute Immediately):
  1. Delete /ChatGPT_dataexport/ folder
     - Security: Remove PII from repository
     - Storage: 99.8% reduction (765 MB)
     - Risk: Version control history exposure

HIGH (Execute Before Agent 4):
  2. Verify task manifest against codebase
  3. Confirm task tracking system exists
  4. Cross-check Ochiai data consistency

MEDIUM (Execute During Agent 4):
  5. Create README for Ochiai data model
  6. Compress/optimize large YAML files
  7. Establish batch validation workflow

LOW (Execute During Operations):
  8. Standardize theme names across files
  9. Validate CSV audit results

================================================================================
INTEGRATION POINTS
================================================================================

For Agents 1-2 (Code & Documentation Scanning):
  • Reference daily_tasks.yaml for workstream definitions
  • Use app_quality_audit_details.csv for template validation
  • Consider Ochiai data for context optimization

For Agent 4 (Final Integration):
  • Leverage metadata_inventory.yaml for complete map
  • Use OUTPUT_INDEX.md for file relationships
  • Implement security recommendation
  • Coordinate 7 workstreams
