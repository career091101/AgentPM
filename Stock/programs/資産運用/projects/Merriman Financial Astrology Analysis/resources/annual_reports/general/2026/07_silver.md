THE 7.8-YEAR CYCLE
All cycles typically break down into two or three sub-cycles of approximately equal length. For 
Gold, the 16-year cycle predominantly breaks down into a two-phase pattern of 7.8-year cycles. This 
7.8-year cycle is 94 months long and has a normal range of 84–104 months. Measuring from the start 
of this current 16-year cycle that bottomed in December 2015, we would have expected the first 7.8-
year cycle phase to bottom sometime between December 2022 and August 2024. Instead, it bottomed 
one month early (83rd month) in November 2022 at $1618. We might now consider the new normal 
range of these cycles to be 83–104 months.
January 2026 will begin the 38th month of the second 7.8-year cycle phase measured from the 
November 2022 bottom. It is next due between October 2029 and July 2031 and will coincide with 
the next 16-year cycle low (notice the nice overlap of the time bands for both lows). The crest will 
happen first, and it was stated last year, “There have been seven 7.8-year cycles since 1968, and not 
one has peaked out before the 34th month. This implies that even higher prices for Gold are in store 
for 2025.” This proved to be even more than correct, with Gold surpassing all upside price targets. 
Last year also stated, “If we look at just the second phase 7.8-year cycles, which we are now in, 
these have topped out in the 35th month twice and also in the 41st month of the cycle. This gives us 
a general time period for a crest between October 2025 and April 2026 at the earliest.” So, we have 
another reason to consider that Gold may have formed a long-term top in October 2025, as this was 
the first month of the time band for when we expected a bearish 7.8-year crest to form. If not, then we 
expect a crest to form by April 2026, but it may spill over into May or June.
Gold has already exploded through all of the normal upside price targets given in last year’s 
forecast. If the rally continues, as we suspect, then Fibonacci extension targets for a 7.8-year crest 
may be $5108 and $5352. These overlap nicely with the price targets given for the 16-year crest 
earlier. There is an even higher price target around $6600 using the highest range of historical per-
centage gains of 7.8–year cycles. But the preferred targets would be in the lower measured price 
target ranges just given. Once this 31-month cycle bottoms, we will then be able to narrow down 
possible upside objectives.

INTERMEDIATE TERM CYCLES
Based on the fact that all cycles break down into two or three sub-cycle phases, the 7.8-year 
cycle could break down into either two 47-month cycles or three 31-month cycles. The predominant 
breakdown has been the three-phase pattern, so we are basing the current forecast on the assumption 
that this 7.8-year cycle will break down in this manner.
January 2026 will begin the 38th month of the first 31-month cycle measured off the start of the 
current 7.8-year cycle in November 2022. With a normal range of 24–38 months, it is due to bottom 
by the end of January 2026 (if it hasn’t bottomed already in November or December). However, there 
is always a chance it could expand by a few months. The crest of this first 31-month cycle phase 
topped on October 20 at a price of $4398. This was a 172% gain and it was in line with the historical 
gains of this cycle. When looking at all 31-month cycle phases that immediately follow a 7.8-year 
low, all but one have been bullish (as this one has been), and they only decline for 1–4 months before 
bottoming. This supports the idea that a significant low in Gold should be in by the end of January, 
with an outside chance of it occurring as late as February 2026.
A normal corrective price target for this coming 31-month low would be $2680–$3336. We would 
also like to see the 16-month moving average tested on the decline (currently around $3200 and rising), 
but given that this has been an extremely bullish cycle, Gold may bottom at a higher level than usual. 
At the very least, a 20% decline could be anticipated, which targets $3500 +/- $100. We would 
also prefer to see prices at least test the 16-month moving average, which stands at about $3200 in 
mid-November 2025 and rises about $100/mo. At whatever price the 31-month cycle ultimately bot-
toms, our bias is that new all-time highs are in store for 2026.
The 31-month cycles can break down into two 16-month half cycles (with a range of 13–20 
months) or three 10.5-month cycles with a range of 9–12 months (sometimes expanding up to 14 
months). The 10.5-month cycle can be referred to as a 50-week cycle that carries an 8-week orb. 
Often, we will get a combination of two- and three-phased patterns. However, the current 31-month 
cycle is breaking down as a classic three-phase pattern of three 50-week cycles. The start of the third 
and final 50-week cycle was November 14, 2024, so it is due to bottom by the end of December 2025 
unless it expands by a few weeks, which is a possibility given that the longer 31-month cycle is also 
due to bottom at the end of this current 50-week cycle.
While the above outlines when, and at what price, we think this first 31-month cycle will bottom 
before ultimately continuing higher into 2026, we need to entertain the possibility that this 7.8-year 
cycle might instead display the less frequent two-phased pattern of two 47-month cycles instead. A 
clue that this might be happening is if Gold fails to even reach the 50-week moving average on this 
decline (currently around $3293 in mid-November 2025 and rising about 30/mo.) or fails to decline 
for even a month before making new highs past December. Such a shallow decline could still be a 
50-week cycle low (47-month cycles contain four 50-week cycles and two 23.5-month half cycles), 
but it would mean that Gold would be rallying in the fourth and final 50-week cycle instead of the 
first 50-week cycle in a new 31-month cycle.
Even in this scenario, we are expecting new all-time highs for Gold in 2026. However, if it is a 
47-month cycle crest that is forming early in 2026, then we could also be looking at an extremely 
steep decline in the coming year as well. This is because a 47-month low would then be due February 
2026–June 2027.

GEOCOSMICS
Saturn in aspect to a planet outside of its orbit has proved to be timely in ushering in a major high 
or low in the Gold market. Specifically, at all but one 7.8-year high or low, Saturn has been aspecting 
Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto within a reasonable orb of time around the occurrence. And, at the one 
instance where Saturn wasn’t making an aspect to Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto (March 2008 high), 
Saturn was still involved, as this was when the last instance of Jupiter in a waxing trine to Saturn 
took place. The reason this is so important for the coming year is that we will have Saturn forming 
a waning sextile to Uranus in January 2026, Saturn conjunct Neptune in February 2026, and Saturn 
forming a waxing sextile to Pluto in March 2026. This makes the first half of 2026 a very good time 
for the current 7.8-year cycle to top out.
First up will be Saturn forming a waning sextile to Uranus, taking place on January 19, 2026. It 
will be the third and final pass of this aspect, with the first two having occurred on April 4, 2025, and 
August 11, 2025. What is interesting is that the previous occurrence of this aspect was in 1979–1980 
and occurred in three passes as well. The first was September 16, 1979, and led to a 10.5-month cycle 
crest three weeks later. The second passage on February 17, 1980, was big for Gold. It coincided with 
a 16-year crest four weeks earlier when Gold hit an all-time high of $873 in January 1980. This high 
remained in place for the next 28 years until it was finally surpassed in 2008. The last pass occurred 
on July 4, 1980, and was followed by a primary cycle crest one week later. Based on historical pre-
cedence, it is within reason that we could see the final 50-week and also 31-month cycle low form 
within 4 weeks of January 19, 2026.
We also need to acknowledge the fact that a 16-year cycle high did occur during the central time 
band of this aspect in the past, and did so with price moving in a parabolic-like manner. Something 
similar is occurring this time around with Gold having exploded to a high (so far) on October 20, 
2025. This is also in the central time band of Saturn, forming a waning sextile to Uranus. While our 
bias is for new highs in Gold during 2026, the possibility that another 16-year high could be in by 
January 19, 2026, is certainly plausible too.
As we move into February, Saturn will form a conjunction with Neptune on the World Point of 
0° Aries. Neptune in Aries could usher in another inflationary wave to wash over the markets, which 
could propel commodity markets (like metals) higher. Gold also has shown to like Neptune and per-
forms favorably when aspects involving Neptune are highlighted. Being that the conjunction between 
Saturn and Neptune is the middle of the three big aspects Saturn is forming to outer planets early in 
2026, makes it a favored time to see a 7.8-year crest within 5 months of February 2026. 
It should also be noted that the last time Saturn entered the sign of Aries was in April 1996. A 7.8-
year crest occurred 2 months prior in February of that year. Might something similar happen when 
Saturn re-enters Aries on February 13, 2026? 
In March, Saturn will form a waxing sextile to Pluto on March 28. The last time this aspect was 
in effect was 1989–1990. At that time, there were three passages that took place, with the third one 
coinciding with a somewhat rare 47-month high within 8 days. Recall that a 7.8-year cycle can break 
down into two 47-month cycle phases. This sets a precedent that a phase of the 7.8-year cycle has 
peaked with this aspect in the past, so it’s possible the top of the second 31-month cycle could be 
around April +/- 1 month.

CONCLUSION
Last year’s Forecast 2025 book concluded, “Gold is due for a 31-month cycle crest and trough 
in 2025. Once the crest of the 31-month cycle forms, Gold could fall 10–20% to a 31-month cycle 
low that is due anytime during 2025. Ideally, this low forms in the latter half of the year between July 
2025 and December 2025.” As we close out 2025 and turn the calendar to 2026, Gold is following 
this script. Gold formed its 31-month cycle crest in October and is now immersed in a correction to a 
31-month cycle bottom. This bottom is ideally due by the end of December 2025, but may extend into 
January 2026. The price target for this low is quite wide at $2680–$3336. Being that Gold has been 
so bullish (as it should be in the first phase of a new 7.8-year cycle), Gold may not drop as far as we 
might expect. Therefore, a more bullish price target for a low might be $3300–$3600.
Once the 31-month low forms, we expect Gold to rally to new all-time highs in 2026. Determin-
ing a price target for the next 31-month cycle crest is difficult without knowing exactly where the 
bottom will form, but if it comes in around $3500, Gold could hit $5225 +/- 425 or even $6285 +/- 
550. However, exceeding the October 20 high of $4398 will need to happen first. Gold likes to form 
double tops and double bottoms, so there is certainly a risk that the high for Gold in 2026 occurs not 
far from $4400. This would be the most bearish outcome for Gold in 2026. In either case, one of the 
most likely times for this high to form is February 2026 +/- 5 months.
In the off chance that Gold satisfies the criteria laid out for a 47-month cycle crest forming 
instead in 2026, Gold could see an impressive decline into the second half of the year.
THREE-STAR CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR 2026—GOLD
The following is a list of three-star geocosmic critical reversal dates (CRDs) used in MMA’s 
market timing calculations. They are most valid when a market is also in the time band for a primary, 
half-primary, or major cycle crest or trough, but may apply to secondary highs or lows, too, that are 
tradeable. Allow a range of three trading days (sometimes as much as six) to these dates for a reversal. 
Also, use the dates given for CRDs in stocks as well. Both sets will apply to one another, and as you 
see, there will be overlap in many cases between the two lists of CRDs.

 SILVER IN 2026
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
REVIEW
Silver has rallied nearly 161% from the October 2023 four-year low of 20.85. In last year’s 
Forecast 2025 book, I stated: “There are two key factors that can drive precious metals to rally: high 
inflation and geopolitical risk. With the case of Silver, demand for the application of Silver in modern 
technologies such as solar panels can also boost prices as we head into a world looking for alterna-
tive sources of energy. As described in the earlier chapters, all these themes will be triggered at the 
Aries Vortex (Feb 2026), which could provide the perfect storm for Silver to rally to a new ATH of 
53.06 +/– 5.27.” 
At the time of this writing, Silver has rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of 54.42 on November 
13, 2025. My bias is that the price target provided in last year’s report will hold, and that we should 
see a sharp decline in the price of Silver as we approach the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, in time 
for the 26-month half-cycle to the final 4-year cycle within the longer-term 9.25-year and 18.5-year 
cycles.

THE 18.5-YEAR CYCLE IN SILVER AND ITS PHASES
The basic long-term cycle in Silver is 18.5 years, with a range of 15–22 years. The previous 
instance of this cycle was the double-bottom low of 1991–1993, when Silver fell to $3.51/ounce 
(February 1991 and February 1993) after its all-time high of $50.00/ounce in January 1980. The 
low of February 1991 occurred 19 years and three months after the prior 18.5-year cycle trough of 
November 1971. The next (and most recent) occurrence of this long-term cycle was in October 2008. 
That was 17 years and eight months later, as Silver fell from its crest of 21.44 in March 2008 to a 
low of 8.40 in October 2008, just as Saturn began its five-passage opposition to Uranus that lasted 
through mid-2010. This decline then led to a retest of the all-time high when Silver soared to 49.82 
in April 2011. The next 18.5-year cycle is therefore due in 2027 +/– 3.5 years. In January 2026, we 
will be entering the 17th year and third month of the current cycle, which places us well within the 
orb of the 18.5-year cycle.
THE 9.25-YEAR HALF-CYCLE
Silver completed a decline to its 9.25-year half-cycle low in March 2020 when it fell to 11.64, a 
drop of nearly 77% from the April 2011 high. That low occurred 11 years and five months into the 
cycle that began in October 2008. The 9.25-year cycles are usually 7–11 years in length. When we
