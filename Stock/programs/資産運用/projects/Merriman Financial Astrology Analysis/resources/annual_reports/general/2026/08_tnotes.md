see cases of cyclical expansion, this is usually followed by a cyclical contraction that restores equi-
librium to the larger cycle. I expect the current 9.25-year cycle to contract closer to seven years, due 
in December 2027 +/– 14 months.
THE 6-YEAR CYCLE
The 18.5-year cycle can also break down into three 6-year cycle phases, with a range of 5–7 
years. As shown in the chart above, the first phase was bullish and ended in December 2014 at 14.16, 
which was six years and two months after the 18.5-year cycle commenced. The second phase was 
bearish and ended with the March 2020 low, five years and three months later. This would mean we 
are now in the third and final 6-year cyclical phase, which is expected to complete the longer 18.5-
year cycle in March 2026 +/– 12 months. The overlap with the contracted 9.25-year cycle discussed 
above is October 2026 to March 2027, which is the ideal time for the low.
Therefore, 2026 will begin the 18th year of the longer-term 18.5-year cycle and the sixth year of 
its second 7- to 11-year half-cycle. The 18.5-year cycle low is due anytime in the next four and a half 
years. The 9.25-year cycle low is due over the next four years. These two cycles are most likely to 
bottom in their overlap, which is 2027–2030. This is also around the same time that the stock market 
is due to bottom, correlating with the lunar node transiting through Aquarius and Capricorn. 
On the other hand, we may be commencing the sixth year of the third and final 6-year phase of the 
18.5-year cycle. The overlap range for this outlook would be slightly earlier, in 2025–2027. Therefore, 
2027 appears to be the year in which all the cycles overlap. We also have the conjunction of the lunar 
node and Pluto taking place in that year. The current 18.5-year cycle commenced with the North Node 
in Aquarius. The North Node will once again enter Aquarius from August 2026 until March 2028.
Last year, I noted: “The crest of the second 9.25-year cycle is most likely still forming, as we 
continue to record higher highs. At the time of writing this report, prices reached 35.07 in October 
2024. It is also possible that we are in the third and final 6-year phase. We know that these cycles can 
be very explosive. Therefore, it remains unclear whether we can take out the 18.5-year [cycle] crest, 
which was 49.82 in April 2011. If we do, the nominal price target would be 53.06 +/- 5.27.”

We have now satisfied this price target, and if the high of 54.42 holds, I would expect a sharp 
decline in Silver, as we are late in the longer-term cycles. Silver is far more volatile than Gold, and it 
tends to spike up and fall back down very quickly. Silver is currently leading the rally, along with a 
case of bearish intermarket divergence: Gold formed its crest in October, while Silver has just made a 
new ATH. This is suggestive of long-term crest formation. This is also accompanied by bearish oscil-
lator divergence in the CCI in the daily, weekly, and monthly time frames. 
As there is a chance that the 18.5-year cycle trough may form next year, there is a likelihood that 
the long-term crest may have formed at 54.42 or may form very soon within the price target of 
53.06 +/– 5.27. If the crest has formed at 54.42, the Fibonacci price target for the 18.5-year cycle 
trough is 31.41 +/– 5.43. The mid-cycle pause price target suggests a steeper decline to 16.24 +/– 
4.51, which would be a decline of roughly 70%. Historical precedence from the prior two instances 
of the 18.5-year cycle—since Silver began trading on the open market in the 1970s—has shown 
declines of 93% and 61% from the crest. While we do not have sufficient data to draw from, the 
second decline was within range of a 61.8% Fibonacci correction. Therefore, I would look to start 
building long-term positions in the 26.00–31.50 range, while also noting strong support in the 
34.50–35.70 and 28.70–31.10 regions. Please note that if the high of 54.42 is taken out, it will 
invalidate these targets.
The broader outlook, marked by the risks of inflation and ongoing geopolitical tensions, offers 
little support for a pronounced decline in Silver prices. Yet it is important to remember that Silver has 
historically entered bearish phases during periods of financial upheaval. The troughs witnessed dur-
ing the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic lockdown serve as clear examples. Consequently, 
it is plausible that a more extensive financial crisis will ultimately underpin the long-term bearish 
trend that culminates in the 18.5-year cycle trough.
THE INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLES REVISITED
The 18.5-year cycle will either break down into two 9.25-year half-cycles, three 6-year phases, or 
a combination of the two. From the low of October 2008, the first 9.25-year cycle formed in March 
2020, 11 years and five months into the cycle. The first 9.25-year phases of the prior two 18.5-year 
cycles were also longer in length and were followed by shorter second-phase cycles. They were 
both just under 11 years in length in the first phase and were followed by shorter 7- to 9-year cycles. 
Therefore, if the next 9.25-year cycle is also shorter, it will be due in December 2027 +/– 14 months, 
as described above.
The 9.25-year cycle tends to break down into the 4-year half-cycle (48-month cycle), as well as 
a 26-month (111-week) half-cycle, which is also often exhibited. Therefore, we are in the final 4-year 
phase of the greater 9.25-year and 18.5-year cycles, which commenced in October 2023 at 20.85. 
At the time of writing in early November 2025, we are in the 25th month of the new 26-month 
cycle, which has turned parabolic. The 26-month half-cycle within the greater 4-year cycle has a 
range of July 2025 to May 2026. It is likely to form within a three-month orb of the Saturn–Neptune 
conjunction, testing the 56-week moving average. If the high of 54.42 holds as the 26-month cycle 
crest, the price target for the trough is 37.64 +/– 3.97. Therefore, my bias is that the 26-month cycle 
trough has not formed as of this writing. Once it does, I expect a corrective rally, but my bias is that 
it will not take out the high that is forming in November 2025. 

## Page 129

125
While we are clearly in a bullish 4-year cycle and still have the second phase of this cycle to play 
out, I would expect the final 26-month cycle to turn bearish as we approach the end of the longer-term 
18.5-year cycle. It is worth pointing out that shorter cycles are susceptible to distortions (contraction 
or expansion) when a longer-term cycle is forming. Therefore, be prepared to start building long 
positions if we begin hitting the 18.5-year cycle price targets before entering the normal range for the 
26-month cycle. 
GEOCOSMICS
The Moon’s North Node has a correlation with forming highs as it transits Aries–Pisces, followed 
by a sharp decline as it transits Aquarius. It began its transit of Aries in July 2023 and will complete 
its transit of Pisces in August 2026. Therefore, the long-term cycle trough is likely to form as the 
Node transits Aquarius from August 2026 until March 2028. Note that this period overlaps with the 
refined date range for the contracted 9.25-year and 18.5-year cycle lows of December 2027 +/– 14 
months. The refined date range is October 2026–March 2028.
As noted last year: “Jupiter, the planet of growth and expansion, will be transiting Cancer, the 
sign associated with Silver, from June 6, 2025, to June 30, 2026. This transit could provide a cata-
lyst for the 9.25-year [cycle] crest or even a new ATH.” I think we are now seeing the full impact 
of this transit, and by the time we approach the Saturn–Neptune conjunction in February 2026 and 
the Jupiter–Pluto opposition in July 2026, Silver is likely to come under bearish pressure. Perhaps 
the 26-month cycle trough will form within the orb of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, and the cor-
rective rally will unfold under the Jupiter–Pluto opposition, before a major sell-off. However, both 
signatures have historically been bearish for Silver, so perhaps we will get a sharp sell-off into the 
midpoint around April–May. 
A shorter-term astrological correlation to note is the transit of Venus. This signature applies only 
to short-term aggressive trading of the major cycles or phases within the primary cycle. We look for a 
trading-cycle trough to form when Venus is in Libra, which is typically followed by a 15.8% rally as 

## Page 130

126
Venus enters Scorpio. We also look for a trading cycle crest to form when Venus is in Pisces–Aries, 
followed by a 17.8% decline as Venus transits Taurus. 
Venus’s next transit of Pisces and Aries will occur from February 10 to March 30, 2026. Venus’s 
next transit of Libra will take place from August 6 to December 4, 2026 (longer than prior transits, as 
Venus will turn retrograde in Scorpio on October 3 and then station direct in Libra on November 14). 
The Venus retrograde will make it difficult to trade the Libra–Scorpio transit. The last time this occurred 
was in 2018, when Silver made a trough on both transits of Libra. It is also worth noting that the Novem-
ber 14 direct station will coincide with Mercury’s direct station. This also happened in April 2025 and 
resulted in a sharp sell-off and reversal, so we may see a similar pattern in November 2026.
CONCLUSIONS
Last year’s Forecast 2025 book concluded: “The technical and fundamental picture remains 
strong for Silver, which could even record a new ATH at 53.06 +/– 5.27 within 3 months of the Sat-
urn–Neptune conjunction on February 20, 2026, before a sharp sell-off into 2027. As we saw in the 
previous 18.5-year cycle, the crest formed in March 2008, and the cycle culminated 7 months later in 
October after a 61% decline.” At the time of writing this report, Silver has just formed a new ATH 
on November 13 at 54.42. If this were not the 18.5-year cycle crest, I would expect it to form soon 
within the price target provided, and for it to be followed by a sharp move down. 
Of course, we never see a straight move down, and there is an intermediate 26-month cycle low 
due, from which I expect a corrective rally. While it is not my bias, Silver is very volatile, and we may 
see the rally retest the high currently being formed. The final phase of the 18.5-year cycle has turned 
parabolic, so I cannot completely rule this scenario out. However, since we are in the final 26-month, 
4-year, and 9.25-year phases of the 18.5-year cycle, the greater probability is that we will see only a 
corrective rally with left translation, as the 26-month cycle turns bearish into 2026–2027.
Therefore, the price target for the 26-month cycle trough is 37.64 +/– 3.97, and it should form 
between July 2025 and May 2026. Once the trough has formed, I would expect a 38.2% to 61.8% 
rally to the 26-month cycle crest two to five months later. I cannot provide a price target for this 
rally until the 26-month cycle trough has formed. From there, I would expect a two- or three-phased 
decline into the 18.5-year cycle trough at either 31.41 +/– 5.43 or a more severe decline toward 16.24 
+/– 4.51 at any point over the next three years.
THREE-STAR CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR 2026—GOLD AND SILVER
The CRDs for Silver are the same as the dates given for Gold at the end of its chapter. You may 
also use the dates given at the end of the DJIA for both Gold and Silver when they differ. In many 
cases, several markets will reverse on the dates given at the end of the chapter on the DJIA.

REVIEW
T-Notes hit their lows of the year early in 2025, on January 13 at 107/06. This was a 50-week 
cycle low and set the stage for rising prices for the remainder of the year. The low was also significant 
because it confirmed the October 2023 low at 105/15.5 as the 6-year cycle bottom. As of this writing 
in November 2025, T-Notes are making new highs for the year above 114/00. However, prices have 
not taken out the 2024 high of 115/23.5 from September of that year. Thus, 2025 could turn out to be 
an “inside year” for T-Notes, in which the previous year’s high and low are not surpassed.
The conclusion section of Forecast 2025 stated, “Our preferred outlook for 2025 is centered 
around a 6-year cycle trough being complete in October 2023. The 6-year cycle is still in its first 
29-month phase, but since the greater 18-year cycle has turned bearish, there is a strong chance 
that the rally in T-Notes from the October 2023 low ends this year. Although T-Notes satisfied the 
upside target for 2024 in the 114/25–116/20 range by rallying as high as 115/23.5 on September 11, 
the duration of the rally was not long enough to qualify as a 6-year cycle crest. The sell-off that fol-
lowed from this September 11 crest is due to the 9–15 month cycle coming due, and it calls for a low 
no later than January 2025. This scenario would obviously be nullified if prices took out their low 
from October 2023 at 105/10.5… Assuming T-Notes are in a newer 6-year cycle from October 2023, 
another retest of the 114/25–116/20 range is in the cards for 2025. But it’s also possible that high is 
exceeded, and that T-Notes could rally as high as 122/00–124/00 in that time band between April and 
October 2025. In fact, this upside target is supported by previous rallies in 6-year cycles. However, 
it’s worth noting that most of the historical instances of rallies in 6-year cycles occurred during the 
secular bull market in T-Notes from 1982 to 2020. Thus, the historical cases may not prove to be as 
accurate as they once were, since T-Notes are in a long-term bear market now per the 18-year cycle 
turning bearish.” 
T-Notes still have not tested the 114/25–116/20 range, which is what I want to see before a 6-year 
cycle crest is complete. This means there could be higher prices or lower interest rates in 2026 before 
a continuation of the bearish 18-year cycle takes hold.
The Federal Reserve also paused its rate cuts from December 2024 to September 2025. The 
central bank has resumed its rate cuts, and the market currently expects additional easing to continue 
well into 2026. This provides a macroeconomic backdrop for T-Notes to continue rallying, at least 
until inflationary pressures begin to increase again. Remember that rate cuts mean money printing, 

## Page 132

128
and, at some point, the return of inflation will coincide with another long-term cycle crest in T-Notes. 
Inflation typically leads to higher interest rates, and T-Note prices move inversely to interest rates. In 
other words, inflation is bearish for T-Notes.
THE 18-YEAR CYCLE
2026 marks the eighth year of the 18-year cycle in T-Notes, measured from the October 2018 low 
at 117/13. This long-term cycle typically lasts 15–21 years, so we are not looking for a trough until 
2033–2039, unless there is a case of cyclical contraction. This also implies that interest rates would 
continue to climb for the next 7–13 years at least. 
This is a bearish 18-year cycle because prices took out the low that began the cycle in October 
2018. Additionally, the crest was formed in March 2020, which was only the second year of the cycle. 
When cycle crests occur in the first half of a cycle, the cycle is considered bearish. We expect the low-
est price of the cycle to occur at its end. This bearish 18-year cycle continues to hang over the T-Note 
market and points to additional inflation problems until the long-term cycle bottoms. 
THE 6-YEAR CYCLE
The 18-year cycle breaks down into three 6-year cycles. The newer 6-year cycle scenario was 
confirmed in 2025, as prices never broke below the October 2023 low, and we are now beyond the 
5- to 7-year orb from the October 2018 long-term cycle low. Thus, 2026 will begin the third year of 
the second 6-year cycle phase within the greater 18-year cycle, which is bearish. 
This 6-year cycle is the most important one for 2026 because the odds favor a 6-year cycle crest 
forming this year—especially if it did not already occur in September 2024. My bias is that the 6-year 
cycle crest is not complete yet, because the September 2024 high occurred only 11 months after the 
October 2023 low. Although a bearish 6-year cycle is expected overall, a bullish first phase of the 
cycle is still anticipated. More on this in the next section.
Forecast 2025 stated, “Prices didn’t quite reach our upside objective for a 6-year cycle crest, 
which supports the idea that new highs could yet be on the horizon for 2025. Not to mention, the 

## Page 133

129
historical length of rallies for 6-year cycles in T-Notes has always lasted at least 18 months. This 
means that if October 2023 was truly the 6-year cycle trough, we wouldn’t look for the 6-year cycle 
crest before April 2025. Plus, the phase breakdown of the 6-year cycle suggests that there is still time 
left in this rally in T-Notes, assuming it is a newer 6-year cycle.” 
This supports the idea that a 6-year cycle crest will form in 2026. Remember that bearish cycles 
spend more time declining than advancing, so a 6-year cycle crest beyond 2026 would not align with 
a bearish 6-year cycle. The next 6-year cycle trough is not expected until 2028–2030, so the antici-
pated crest this year sets T-Notes up for another multi-year decline. New lows beneath the October 
2023 low at 105/10.5 are also anticipated for this cycle’s bottom.
THE 29-MONTH CYCLE
The 6-year cycle then breaks down into two or three 29-month cycles. The duration of the 6-year 
cycle determines whether there will be two or three 29-month cycle phases. Most 29-month cycles last 
between 22 and 36 months, and since January 2026 begins the 27th month from October 2023, T-Notes 
are already within the time band for a 29-month cycle trough. It is only the crest that still needs to be 
confirmed. Based on historical metrics, the 29-month cycle low is expected no later than October 2026.
With the 6-year cycle bottom in October 2023, the 29-month cycle was reset as well. Forecast 
2025 stated, “T-Notes are still in their first 29-month phase within the 6-year cycle, and as a rule, the 
first phase of every cycle is bullish. Historically, the majority of 29-month cycles have rallied for at 
least 9–27 months. The September 11, 2024, high would fall into this range for a 29-month cycle high, 
although it would be a bit early from a 6-year cycle standpoint, and, as a rule, the longer-term cycles 
overpower the shorter ones. Plus, given that the first phases are usually bullish, it would be prefer-
able to see it rally at least past the halfway mark of the cycle, say 15–16 months. This would call for 
a high as soon as January or February 2025, but, given the current technical picture of T-Notes, it is 
rather unrealistic. Thus, it would still be ideal for T-Notes to rally into April 2025 or beyond from a 
29-month cycle standpoint.” 
T-Notes never hit a new 29-month cycle high in 2025, although prices are not far from exceeding 
the September 2024 crest at 115/23.5. There is still enough time in the 29-month cycle for new highs 
in 2026, although this supports the idea of a crest forming in the first half of the year.
The 29-month cycle crest is lining up to coincide with the greater 6-year cycle crest. To narrow 
down the timeframe for a high even further, the 29-month cycle is broken down into two or three 
50-week cycles that typically last 9–15 months. T-Notes began 2025 with a 50-week cycle trough on 
January 13, 2025, at 107/06. In theory, a 50-week cycle low could unfold before the start of 2026, but 
if not, then the cycle bottom would be expected no later than April 2026, as the beginning of the year 
corresponds to the 51st week, or 12th month, of this cycle. 
T-Notes are still in the second 50-week cycle phase within the greater 29-month cycle. In theory, 
a third phase could unfold in 2026 that aligns with the greater 29-month and 6-year cycle crests. This 
is a wild card for the cycle scenarios in T-Notes going into 2026.	
GEOCOSMICS
As of this writing in November 2025, the high for T-Notes occurred near several key outer-plan-
etary aspects in April. However, there is still a chance that new highs could form before the calendar 
year ends. Forecast 2025 stated, “Looking ahead into 2025, the most notable observation to be had
