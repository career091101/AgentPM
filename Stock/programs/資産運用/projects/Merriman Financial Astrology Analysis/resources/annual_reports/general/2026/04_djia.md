Next, we note that Trump’s progressed Ascendant in 2026 will be at 3° Scorpio, in a square 
aspect to his progressed Saturn. This can represent a time of frustration and resistance (Saturn) to do 
what he wants to do (progressed Ascendant). In Scorpio, his tendency to act abruptly and without 
approval can cause serious backlash, an impediment to his desire to get everyone on the same page. 
Threats may be made, personally and politically, to harm the careers of those he battles with. There 
is an intense effort to block him. This is amplified by the progressed midheaven (MC) in Leo (the 
leader, or king), conjunct his natal and progressed Pluto, which rules Scorpio. The MC is his status 
in the world, his career, and how the world views him. In this case, the involvement of Pluto may 
indicate that others view him as coercive, a threat, and in response, become coercive and a threat to 
him. On top of that, his progressed Moon is still in Scorpio until the summer, forming a square to his 
natal Mars and Ascendant, and opposition to transiting Uranus. 
It appears that 2026 will be very intense, even by his own standards. It may turn out to be a year of 
many personal threats to him and by him. His inner circle is mostly fine and supportive, with Venus and 
Jupiter conjunct in Libra. But a stampede of resistance from others lies in his path, embodied by Pluto. 
He will need to be mindful of his personal safety and well-being (health), especially in the first 
half of the year. There is something that has to change, be eliminated, reformed, from his current 
direction, for Pluto requires surrender on some level, which is not part of his business model. Yet no 
one escapes unscathed under powerful Pluto signatures. Is it his health, or just the nature of the politi-
cal battleground he is fighting on? Is it a threat from within the country, or bad actors outside who 
wish to inflict harm on the U.S. and to him personally? This is part of Scorpio and Pluto’s secretive 
behind-the-scenes nature, where plots brew out of sight.
Another progressed aspect to note is Mercury straddling the conjunction between his natal Mars 
and Ascendant. He may be more temperamental and verbally assertive (aggressive) than usual to oth-
ers. In his former life with “The Apprentice” TV show, he used to enjoy telling people, “You’re fired!” 
In his role as president, he is apt to continue firing people, dismissing them from any role in his admin-
istration if they oppose him. His words can sting. At the same time, this implies he will be a very active 
deal maker and negotiator through 2026 and 2027. He doesn’t stop. It is like he is in a hurry.
TRANSITS
What we have seen this year is new levels of graft and grift. We seem to be moving rapidly 
toward a justice system in which the president essentially gets to decide who should be in 
prison. If you’re a political enemy, we’ll come up with a crime to fit your punishment. If you’re 
a friend, we will annul your crimes. 
—Gerard Baker, “Trump Accelerates Our Decline Into Moral Relativism,” Wall Street 
Journal, October 28, 2025.
There are three major transits that stand out in President Trump’s progressed chart this year. The 
first is the final passage of Uranus square his natal Ascendant, which began in late June 2025 and 
ends April 24, 2026. As stated last year concerning this transit, “As Uranus is not considered a sign 
of stability and comfort, and given that Mr. Trump seems at his best in situations of chaos, he will 
have plenty of opportunities to deal with chaotic situations, many of which will likely be of his own 
making. In the words of Jerry Lee Lewis, there’s ‘gonna be a whole lot of shakin’ goin’ on.’” That is 
precisely what has been unfolding during the first year of his second term in office. There have been 
no breaks from the plentitude of executive actions and presidential decisions. And when one of these 

## Page 99

95
actions is met with resistance, another is set in motion, and the attention suddenly shifts from one 
subject to another. There are no breaks. As a result, much is accomplished, but nothing comes without 
opposition. It has been a year of peaks and valleys for both the president and the population. That’s 
not going to change in the first half of 2026.
The next major transit unfolding will be Saturn forming a cardinal T-square to the President’s 
natal Mercury-Neptune square. This is interesting because the only aspect of the President’s natal 
Mercury (mental processes, style of communication) is the square to Neptune. Mercury has to do 
with facts and logic, Neptune with abstracts, even imaginings. They work well together for some-
one engaged in sales, creative writing, and fantasy, but they do not work well in expressing facts to 
those who see reality differently. In fact, this combination has a unique way of reinterpreting events, 
such as history, to justify their current behavior or decision-making. An example would be when he 
abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada after the head of Ontario’s provincial government ran an ad 
quoting Ronald Reagan’s speech on the dangers of tariffs. Trump claimed this ad was fake, that Rea-
gan was really a supporter of tariffs. It turns out that the president was incorrect.
The president’s critics often accuse him of ethical missteps, corruption, lying, or projecting blame 
onto others, which they assert is a result of his own actions or thoughts. This is a classical Mercury-
Neptune experience. But now comes Saturn to make a T-square to this Mercury-Neptune dynamic. 
This suggests difficulty in April 2026 +/- 1 month over something he did or said. It would be wise of 
him to make sure his behavior is ethical, facts are correct, and to avoid attempts to create mislead-
ing narratives (supposedly “moral justifications”) that will come back to haunt him around this time. 
Given that Mercury is the ruler of his Sun sign, and thus connected to one’s vitality, nervous system, 
and respiratory tract, this would be a good time for him to also take a break and rest. 
The third major transit to his chart in 2026 is the Lunar North Node crossing his Descendant. This 
takes place on August 20, 2026, but has an orb of influence up to nine months on either side. This 
is an aspect of a major transition. It is also an aspect that I consider one of the most karmic periods 
in one’s life, from a metaphysical point of view. This is a time when actions of the past come home 
to roost, especially concerning relationships of importance in one’s life, past and future. New ones 
begin, old ones may end. The Lunar North Node now heads below the horizon, which is a time that 
tests one’s faith—faith in oneself, faith in a higher force. It is a time of reflection. Perhaps he is focus-
ing on his legacy over the next 4.5 years as the Lunar North Node heads towards the nadir of the chart 
(IC). The more one tries to make things happen in the world, the more one’s life experiences suggest 
he needs to work on the inner plane, personality, and aspects within himself. Periods of self-reflection 
begin to increase.

Figure 15: Transits of Election Day, November 3, 2026 (outer wheel) to Donald Trump’s 
natal chart (inner wheel). Note Saturn retrograde square his natal Mercury, and the Lunar 
North Node falling below the Descendant. 
It doesn’t mean there will not be successes, especially as Saturn continues to move towards the 
top of his chart, which is a sign of success, but also increasing demands on his time and energy. He 
is building a legacy, and he is well aware of this. But the trend is changing, and conflicts between 
the world within and the world outside are growing. It is of interest to note that this will be in effect 
during the midterm elections, when the president (as of now) is very confident that he will score 
an unusual midterm victory and maintain control of the House and Senate. The transit of the Lunar 
South Node over the Ascendant, and the Lunar North Node crossing the boundary that separates the 
region above the horizon (outer world) from the region below (inner world), indicates that his inter-
est in accruing more and more power in the world may be on the decline. Perhaps this is because he 
is aware he is a lame duck? Perhaps it is because he wants to focus more on his legacy after his term 
ends? This would also fit with the transits to the U.S. chart. The two are intertwined. But unless he is 

## Page 101

97
willing to embrace this new 18-year cycle, this may not be an easy transition for someone like him, 
with Mars rising in Leo, to enter into.
The one aspect that indicates he may experience success with the mid-term elections is transiting 
Jupiter over his Mars-Ascendant, November 30–December 25. Is that close enough to the election 
to have an effect? If so, Jupiter crossing the Ascendant is usually a time for celebration and victory. 
However, Jupiter moves fast and may not be related to the election. It could indicate some other 
success in his life at the end of the year. Additionally, there is another cosmic problem. Saturn will 
retrograde back into a square to his natal Mercury, November 8, 2026, through January 14, 2027. 
Saturn is stronger than Jupiter. Saturn is usually not in the mood to celebrate, but in a hard aspect with 
Mercury, it may be concerned about the future. Saturn might indicate resignations from his cabinet 
after the mid-term elections. 
How will he handle it? Will he accept his leadership, which is soon coming to an end? Or will 
he try to find some way to hold onto power by revising (somehow) the Twenty-Second Amendment, 
to let him serve additional terms? This is a real battle within himself. I don’t think he knows until 
the very end. Transiting Saturn rising up the chart indicates he may seek another term in spite of the 
fact that it is not allowed in the Constitution as it now stands. But the Lunar North Node entering the 
lower part of his chart suggests he also sees value in winding down and not complicating his legacy 
by forcing the Constitution to change, and the negative reactions that may cause.

INTRODUCTION
The U.S. stock market has been on a tear for the past 17 years, following its 72-year cycle low of 
March 6–9, 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, when the DJIA had dropped 54.4% from its 
then all-time high made just 17 months earlier, in October 2007. The low in March 2009 was 6470 in 
the DJIA. By the end of October 2025 (as this is being written), it was trading at a new all-time high 
of 48,040, a gain of over 742% in 16.5 years, which isn’t bad. It demonstrates how wealth is built in 
the stock market via knowledge of investing and cycle studies during long-term cycle troughs. 
Along the way, however, there have been seven cases of 16% or greater declines in the DJIA, 
with the steepest being the 37% one-month decline from February 2020 to March 2020, during the 
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is a lot of steep sell-offs in just 18 years (2007–2025). 
They ranged in intervals of 1–4 years from one another as follows:
1. March 2009	
	
	
54.4% decline from high of October 2007
2. October 2011 (31 mo) 	
	
19.2% decline from high of May 2011
3. August 2015 (46 mo)	
	
16.2% decline from high of May 2015
4. December 2018 (40 mo)	 	
19.4% decline from the high of October 2018
5. March 2020 (15 mo)	
	
37.1% decline from high of February 2020
6. October 2022 (31 mo)	
	
22.4% decline from high of January 2022
7. April 2025 (30 mo)	
	
18.8% decline from high of December 2024

## Page 103

99
Of the seven completed cases of 16% or greater declines since the then all-time high of October 
2007, six have lasted 30–46 months. The outlier was 2020’s pandemic low at only a 15-month inter-
val. That was indeed an outlier in many ways. If the next 16+% decline happens in the 30–46 month 
interval, it would occur from October 2027 to February 2029. As will be demonstrated shortly, that 
falls within the time band of several cycles, including the important 18-year cycle trough, a genera-
tional low that is due 2022–2030. 
Yet, when one looks at the long-term history of the DJIA (as illustrated in The Ultimate Book on 
Stock Market Timing, Volume 1: Cycles and Patterns in the Indexes 1), the picture is concerning, because 
1) the low to a high in the 18-year cycle has lasted 6–20 years in all 12 completed cases to date, and 2) 
in 11 of those 12 cases, the rally lasted 9–20 years. As 2026 begins, it will mark the 17th year that this 
cycle has been overall bullish, which makes it in the mature stage of its 18-year cycle. The peak of the 
18-year cycle is due at any time now, followed by the low, which is also due any time by 2030.
Historically, though, the crest has been 17 years or greater in three of those 12 cases, for only a 
25% frequency. However, all three cases of these short but steep declines have occurred within the 
four cases since the Great Depression of 1932, which was the prior 72-year cycle. This means bull 
markets have lasted 17–20 years in 75% of the four most recent cases. This will be the 4th time in 
the last five cases that it has lasted at least 17 years, and three of the prior four bull runs have lasted 
18–20 years. The cycle top is due. 
It’s as if you know you are this close, but also that far away, from an important top, after which 
the stock market historically falls at least 37%. The frequency of a 37% or greater decline happening 
by 2030 is about 83% (10 of 12 cases). And in eight of those cases, the decline was between 37.5 and 
63.6%. Only once was the decline less than 30% (in 1953). And only twice was it greater than 63.6%. 
Since this next 18-year cycle low is not expected to be part of a greater cycle, the range of 
37.5–63.6% is the projected drop off from the current all-time high that is due. If it falls more than 
63.6%, or even more than the 54.4% decline into the long-term cycle low of March 2009, then an 
even longer-term 90-year cycle must be considered. That degree of decline has only occurred twice in 

## Page 104

100
U.S. stocks: into the lows of 1842 and 1932. If the 90-year cycle is to occur a third time, it would be 
due within 15 years of 2022, and probably within 10 years of 2022 (by 2032), based on the long-term 
Saturn–Uranus conjunction taking place on June 28, 2032. Our studies have shown that the greatest 
percentage of long-term stock market cycles have occurred near a Saturn–Uranus conjunction or 
opposition than any other planetary pair cycle.1 
The takeaway from this introduction is that the DJIA is due to top out any time before 2029, 
and most likely between 2026 and 2029. However, there is just as strong a probability that the 
18-year cycle low will happen October 2027–January 2029, and the crest would happen before 
then. The challenge is: how much before then? Since 1932, there have been no bear markets at the 
end of the 18-year cycle that lasted more than two years. Two of them lasted less than one year. 
The shortest on record was the 40% decline in just two months from August to October 1987. It is 
this author’s opinion that under President Donald Trump, we will see another instance of a steep 
and brief bear market lasting less than two years, and probably less than one year. Nevertheless, a 
decline of 37–63% will offer a generational opportunity to build wealth via the stock market for 
those who are willing to be patient for 9–20 years afterwards, which could yield a return between 
300% and 800%.2
Now, let’s see if we can add more pieces of the current stock market puzzle in the quest to narrow 
the time band for both the crest and the trough. For if we can, that guidance can mean the difference 
between a very healthy and profitable investment on the horizon versus one that could be meager if 
entering at the wrong time (too early or too late) or one that could even spell a severe loss if not care-
ful and aware of the cycle messages ahead.
CYCLES: LONG-TERM
We begin this section with a review of long-term cycles (low to low) in the DJIA.
The 18-Year Cycle: The last 18-, 36-, and 72-year cycles started with the low of March 6–9, 2009. 
Our focus will be on the 18-year cycle, as that is the longest cycle currently coming due, from 2024 to 
2030. Since it is the first phase of longer cycles, it is not expected to be as steep a decline as happened 
into the low of March 2009, which was 54.4% in the DJIA. However, as noted earlier, over 80% of 
18-year cycles have declined 37–63%, so this remains our price target for this important cycle.
Time-wise, the crest is due any time before the end of 2029. The low will follow and is due at 
any time before the end of 2030. 
Historically, the price appreciation from the start of the 18-year cycle to its crest has been 122–
778%. However, since 1914, it has gained 320–778%. Measured from the start of the current cycle 
at 6470, the upside price target for the crest is 27,174–56,807. As of this writing, the DJIA is in the 
upper part of this range, nearing 50,000. Thus, the time and price criteria for the 18-year cycle crest 
are being met. The final high is due at any time.
The 9-Year Cycle: All cycles break down into divisions of 2 and 3, and sometimes both. The half-
cycle (9-year cycle) to the 18-year cycle has a range of 7.5–10.5 years. The 9-year half-cycle time band 
has coincided with a prominent trough in 10 of the 12 cases to date in the 18-year cycle, with some 
slight distortions. The March 2020 pandemic low, for instance, was exactly 11 years following the start 
of the 18-year cycle, and although slightly outside of our normal range, it will be considered a 9-year 
half-cycle. If correct, the second 9-year half-cycle is next due September 2027–September 2030.

## Page 105

101
Price-wise, in all but two of these cases, the crest of the second half of the 18-year cycle was 
considerably higher than the crest of the first half. That is the case again now. 
The 6-Year Cycle: The six-year cycle is a 1/3 division of the 18-year cycle. It has a normal range 
of 5–7 years, but can expand to eight years in the second or third phase. In all 12 cases of the 18-year 
cycle, there has been a 5–7-year cycle low in the first phase. However, the current 18-year cycle 
is now in its third phase. The first phase was a double bottom in August 2015 and February 2016, 
which was 6–7 years following the start of the cycle in March 2009. The second phase was the low 
on October 13, 2022, again 6–7 years after the first phase trough. Allowing a range of 5–8 years, the 
final phase will be due 2027–2030.
The measured price targets for the crest of this third 6-year cycle phase are 47,500 +/– 4842 
and 50,244 +/– 4115. The overlap is 46,128–52,342. Once completed, we will look for a decline of 
37–63%. We would also look for prices to fall to or below the 108-month moving average shown on 
the monthly chart.

Within the longer-term 9- and 6-year cycles, the DJIA also subdivides into two or three phases. 
The current 9-year cycle has been exhibiting three 3-year phases. The 6-year cycle can also be sub-
divided into two 3-year phases or three 2-year sub-cycles. Both share in common a 3-year cycle. 
This often happens with “combination cycles,” and this 18-year cycle is a combination of 9-year 
and 6-year cycle phases. They share in common a 3-year cycle with a range of 30–42 months, which 
MMA Analyst Ulric Aspegrén calls a “keystone cycle,” which means it is a subdivision of two in one 
cycle branch and a subdivision of three in another. 
It is for this reason that we will focus on the 3-year cycle and not the 4-year (or even 4.5-year) 
cycles of our longer-term studies. Besides, the three-year cycle has been more reliable than the 4-year 
cycle over the past 50 years. 
Following the 9-year cycle low of March 2020, the DJIA has exhibited 3-year cycle lows in Octo-
ber 2022 (31 months) and April 2025 (30 months). The April 2025 low was the second of three 3-year 
phases to the 9-year cycle. It was also the first of two 3-year cycles troughs that make up the 6-year 
cycle that began in October 2022. Thus, the next 3-year cycle low is on schedule to complete not only 
the 9- and 6-year cycles, but the entire 18-year cycle. If we measure 30–42 months following the low 
of April 7, 2025, we get an ideal time band for all four cycles (18-, 9-, 6-, and 3-year) due between 
October 2027 and October 2028. However, we have to be careful because when longer-term cycles 
are due, the shorter-term cycles (phases) within them can distort (contract or expand) beyond their 
normal time bands.

I began this chapter with the study of the seven declines of 16% or greater since the 72-year cycle 
crest of October 2007. To repeat, “Of the seven complete cases of 16% or greater declines since the 
then all-time high of October 2007, six have lasted 30–46 months. If the next 16+% decline happens 
in the 30–46 month interval, it would occur October 2027–February 2029.” It overlaps nicely with 
the 18-, 9-, 6-, and 3-year cycles.
Our formal studies on price gains and losses in The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing, Vol-
ume 1: Cycles and Patterns in the Indexes1 were conducted on 4–year cycles. However, since Table 2 
showed a 4-year cycle low that also began April 7, 2025, and its next low is also due during the 2028 
+/– 1 year time band, we can apply those studies to the current market and calculate a price target 
for the crest of all these cycles. First of all, these studies show that the vast majority of rallies from 
the low to the high of a 4-year cycle last 12–49 months with a price appreciation of 70–189%. This 
would mean that the crest will 1) likely occur after March 2026 and 2) could soar to 62,240–105,800. 
However, there is a caveat. This is the last 3-year cycle phase of 6- and 9-year cycles, which 
are in their last phase of the greater 18-year cycle. The percentage of appreciation in the last 4-year 
cycle phases of an 18-year cycle, in our formal studies, was not so great. It ranged from a gain of 
only 29% to 83% in six of the seven cases since 1893. That would yield an upside price target of only 
47,225–67,000. This is interesting because it overlaps with our measured upside price calculation of 
the 9-year cycle at 49,400–57,750 and the 6-year cycle at 51,609–56,481. Earlier, we calculated that 
the 18-year cycle crest would rise to 27,174–56,807, and the six-year cycle to 46,128–52,342. It may 
be too much to expect, but all four of these price calculations overlap 51,609–52,342. 
The final intermediate-term cycle we consider is the 50-week type, with a normal range of 34–67 
weeks. Usually, there will be three of these phases within a 3-year cycle. April 7, 2025, began the first 
50-week (and 3-year) cycle. It is due to bottom with 16.5 weeks of March 27, 2026, or December 1, 
2025–July 17, 2026. But this will only be the first of three 50-week cycles before the final 3-, 6-, 9-, 
and 18-year cycles come due. In fact, there could even be more or fewer than three 50-week phases 
here since this is the last stage of so many greater cycles converging, which is when distortions most 
often occur. The timing is never easy when very long-term generational bottoms unfold. Investors 
need to develop a buy-in plan whenever the DJIA falls more than 35% off its all-time high, which 
could begin as early as 2026.
For now, our immediate trading plan calls for a buying opportunity within 16 weeks of March 27, 
2026, and with a decline of at least 8%. Yet, if the next 50-week cycle rally only makes a double top 
to the high of this current 50-week cycle, or stalls within an upside price target range given above, 
investors must be prepared for a powerful reversal to begin.
GEOCOSMIC CYCLES
Our basic rule is that long-term cycle crests and troughs tend to unfold when major aspects 
involving long-term planetary pair cycles involving Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto are in effect. 
We also consider the sign position of the Lunar North Node.
We have two long-term planetary pair cycles in effect now. First and foremost is the 36-year syn-
odic (conjunction) cycle of Saturn and Neptune, which came within 13’ of a degree of exactness in 
July 2025 and will be exact on February 20, 2026. Our studies reported in The Ultimate Book on Stock 
Market Timing Volume 2: Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles2 showed that long-term stock 

## Page 107

103
market cycles tended to top out within 11 months of the beginning through the end of this aspect, with 
all but one in 8 months or less. This means the long-term cycle crest could happen by October 2026. 
The second long-term planetary aspect is Uranus trine Pluto, which will transpire five times 
between July 2026 and May 2028. It was close enough in the middle of 2025 to be considered already 
underway (less than a degree from an exact trine). There are only three cases of trines between these 
two planets in the history of the DJIA. Two of them were 9-year cycle troughs. With an orb of 10 
months on either side of the first or last passage, this fits well in a broad time band for the 18-year 
cycle as described previously. However, this is too wide a time band to be of any practical use. The 
Saturn–Neptune conjunction is more useful for identifying a possible 18-year cycle crest.
Both Saturn and Neptune will make sextiles to Uranus and Pluto in 2025–2026. This is a favor-
able combination that could also help identify a long-term cycle crest whose time band is now in 
effect. Saturn makes three sextiles from April 4, 2025, to March 28, 2026. Neptune will sextile Ura-
nus and Pluto from August 28, 2025, through June 6, 2027. The overlap of August 2025 through 
March 2026 stands out for an important reversal. It will likely be at least a 50-week cycle crest, but 
could also exhibit the first 50-week cycle trough.
There is also a very significant cosmic arrangement taking place July 20–21, 2026, as mentioned 
in our brief note to traders at the beginning of this year’s book. This is when Jupiter will trine Nep-
tune, oppose Pluto, and be in sextile to Uranus. Within six months, and usually only two, the Jupiter–
Neptune trine has a strong correlation to at least a 50-week cycle trough. The Jupiter sextile Uranus 
aspect is also similar to a propensity to identify a 50-week or greater cycle low within 4 months. 
However, the Jupiter/Pluto opposition is most important. It can be either an intermediate (or longer 
term) cycle low or high, or both, within six months. If it is a high, it takes place within only 4 months, 
and a powerful decline follows. This fits well with our outlook of the 18-year cycle crest unfolding in 
2026, and ideally within four months of July 2026.
The Jupiter–Saturn Cycle 
Throughout history, intermediate or long–term cycle highs and lows in the U.S. stock market 
have related to the 20-year Jupiter–Saturn cycle as follows: 
During the conjunction, stock markets tend to make highs.
1–3 years later, near the first 1/8 phase (waxing semi-square) of the 20-year cycle, the U.S. 
stock market completes an intermediate-term cycle low. There is usually an international military war 
breaking out then as well.
•	
The stock market tends to rally and form an important crest 3–6 years after the conjunction.
•	
The stock market tends to suffer a serious decline, even a crash, 7–9 years after the conjunction.
The Jupiter–Saturn conjunction occurred on December 20, 2020, and there indeed was a military 
crisis as the six-year stock market cycle trough occurred in October 2022 (1–3 years after the con-
junction). The market was then due to rally 3–6 years after that low, which brings us to 2023–2026, 
and indeed the market has rallied into this time band. The next step involves a serious decline, per-
haps a crash, into an important long-term cycle low due in 2027–2029. Once again, this aligns with 
the labeling of the long-term cycles according to the “Cycles Progress Table” given earlier. Our 
expectation is for the DJIA to lose 37–63% of its value from the high to the low during this period.
