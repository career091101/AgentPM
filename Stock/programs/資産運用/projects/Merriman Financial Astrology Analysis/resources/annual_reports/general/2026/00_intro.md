DEDICATION
This year’s book is dedicated to the generation born with Pluto in Leo and Neptune in Libra. This 
includes many of the so-called “baby boomers.” What sets this generation apart? Why has it been so 
maligned by others? And why dedicate this year’s book to the Pluto-in-Leo, Neptune-in-Libra gen-
eration (i.e., my generation)? 
First, with Pluto in Leo, you gave new importance to the values of fun and happiness. I don’t 
see any other generation in my lifetime enjoying life as much as we have. Sure, we have been self-
centered, which may disturb those who think we have not cared about future generations—but that is 
not entirely true. We have been colorful, discovered ways to live longer and healthier, and seem never 
to end the quest for happiness! In the words of Bob Dylan, this generation believes in being “Forever 
Young,” regardless of chronological age.
Second, with Neptune in Libra, this generation has lived the altruistic quest for both world peace 
and love. They have sought romance and the experience of an active, mobile life. This generation typi-
cally sees the best in others, starting relationships with trust until proven otherwise. There is a quality of 
innocence and playful joy in interacting with others. There is an uplifting delight and a sense of freedom 
in dancing and music. The music of this generation has transformed cultures around the world. Musi-
cians have been this generation’s philosophers, stimulating revolutionary thinking that has brought its 
population together in a communal bond of shared values, even if unconventional at times.
Through the relentless search for truth, this generation’s exploration of studies such as astrology, 
metaphysics, meditation, and Far Eastern philosophies has opened up new areas of understanding and 
ways to cope with the monumental changes that have occurred in our lifetime. This generation has 
truly led humankind into a new consciousness. You have been the leaders of the modern-day astrol-
ogy movement! And so, this year’s book is dedicated to all members of that generation who continue 
to uphold these ideals.

 MARKET TERMINOLOGY USED IN THIS BOOK
The following are terms that the reader will find throughout this book, especially in the Financial 
Markets sections.
Cycle: A measurable phenomenon that recurs consistently at regular intervals of time. In markets, 
cycles are measured from trough (lowest point) to trough unless specified otherwise.
Trough: A low in price; the bottom of a cycle, where the cycle ends and begins.
Crest: The peak of a cycle; the highest price between the troughs that define the cycle.
Phase: A sub-cycle within each cycle. Each cycle is composed of two or three sub-cycles, or phases, 
which are approximately one-half or one-third of the greater cycle’s length.
Cycle pattern: There are three common cycle patterns: 
•	
The classical three-phase pattern, in which there are three sub-cycles (or phases) of approxi-
mately one-third the greater cycle length
•	
The classical two-phase pattern, consisting of two sub-cycles (or phases) of approximately 
one-half the greater cycle length
•	
A combination pattern, which has sub-cycles at both the one-half and one-third intervals of 
the greater cycle
Bull market: Consecutive higher crests and higher troughs of the same cycle type; often associated 
with right translation patterns of primary cycles. Right translation means the crest occurs in the 
second half of the cycle, past its midpoint.
Bear market: Consecutive lower troughs and lower crests of the same cycle type; often associated 
with left translation patterns of primary cycles. Left translation means the crest occurs in the first 
half of the cycle.
Trend: Either bullish or bearish, depending on the cycle being studied. The first phase of a cycle is 
always bullish, and the last is usually bearish.
Support: An area below the current market price where prices are expected to hold on declines—a 
“floor” for prices.
Resistance: An area above the current market price where prices are expected to hold on rallies—a 
“ceiling” for prices.
Treasury values: In the chapter on T-Notes and Interest Rates, prices for T-Notes are quoted in 
values of 1/32 of a point. For instance, a value of 130/25 means 130 and 25/32 of a point. This is 
the standard quoting convention for Treasuries.
For further information on understanding market and cycle terminology, the reader is advised to 
consult the author’s work entitled Merriman on Market Cycles: The Basics.

 GEOCOSMIC TERMINOLOGY USED IN THIS BOOK
Conjunction: An aspect that occurs when two planets are in the same sign and degree of the zodiac. 
They appear to be together. A conjunction marks the starting point of a cycle involving those 
two planets. 
Opposition: An aspect that occurs when two planets are in opposite signs and degrees of the zodiac. 
They appear to be on opposite sides of the sky—when one sets in the west, the other rises in the 
east. An opposition represents the halfway point of a cycle involving those two planets. It marks 
the culmination of the themes, or the peak of the cycle, which began with their conjunction.
Square: An aspect that occurs when two planets are 90 degrees apart in the zodiac. They appear to 
be at a right angle—perpendicular to one another. A square represents the first (opening) and last 
(closing) quarter phases of a cycle involving those two planets.
Trine: An aspect that occurs when two planets are 120 degrees apart in the zodiac. A trine represents 
the first-third and last-third phases of a cycle involving those two planets. Trines are considered 
soft or harmonious aspects, along with the sextile (60 degrees, or one-sixth of the zodiac circle).
Hard aspects: The conjunction, square, and opposition are considered the hard aspects in astrology. 
They are challenging and difficult, representing the urge to force conflicting dynamics to work 
together.
T-square: A pattern in which two planets are in opposition, with both square to a third planet.
Grand square: A pattern in which four planets form consecutive squares to one another. It consists 
of two pairs of oppositions, with each pair also square to the other pair.
Grand trine: A pattern in which three planets form consecutive trines to one another. It appears 
as an equilateral triangle in the heavens and is considered the most fortunate of all planetary 
configurations.
Cardinal signs: Every third sign, starting with Aries, followed by Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. 
Cardinal signs mark the beginning of each season and are associated with action and initiation.
Fixed signs: Every third sign, starting with Taurus, followed by Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. Fixed 
signs occupy the middle of each season. They stabilize and maintain the energy initiated by car-
dinal signs and are said to be steadfast, persistent, and sometimes stubborn.
Mutable signs: Every third sign, starting with Gemini, followed by Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. 
Mutable signs close each season and represent change, adaptability, and flexibility.

 ABOUT THE 2026 FRONT COVER
This year’s Forecast 2026 book cover is the work of creative graphic designers Kat Powell of 
Denver, Colorado, and Antonia Langsdorf-Merriman of Cologne, Germany (now Miami, Florida). 
The design is symbolic of the past, present, and future.
Notice the book the children are reading. It represents a compilation of the past 50 years during 
which this annual Forecast book has been published. That’s right—we are celebrating the 50th year 
of publishing our Forecast books! The book in the children’s hands symbolizes these 50 years, a 
period during which we have identified the major cosmic events of each year and shown how they 
likely correlated with collective psychology and human activity in the spheres of global and national 
economics, politics, sociopolitical trends, and financial markets.
The children themselves represent the future. They are the youth who will determine the course 
humankind takes in the years ahead. Note their diversity: they are of different sexes and nationali-
ties. Yet there are no barriers preventing them from being fully engaged with one another. This is the 
future of the world in which racial and gender differences become meaningless as a basis for interac-
tion. The politics of polarization and propaganda that have divided the world over the past 50 years 
will eventually come to an end—and will, in fact, have come to an end—as humankind grows into 
this “New Aira,” identified in the annual Forecast books as unfolding between 2020 and 2032. 
The backdrop of this image shows a red-colored nebula lighting up the heavens. This celestial 
phenomenon symbolizes the “Aries Vortex” of 2025-2027, which culminates on February 20, 2026. 
It also reflects the present state of our solar system, marked by the unusually rare configuration of 
Uranus and Pluto in a favorable trine aspect. The midpoint of this trine is 0° Aries, the degree where 
Saturn and Neptune join together in 2025-2026. Aries, ruled by Mars—the “red planet” of war and 
conflict—is also the sign of new beginnings. It signifies a time of epic change, transformation, and 
turbulence. For this reason, it is depicted as a whirling mass of red activity above the otherwise 
peaceful and beautiful Earth. In the background, the innocent children are shown without social or 
meaningless barriers, united in their quest to understand the present and future by reading the books 
of the past. 
The children (the future) are surrounded by books. A home with a library symbolizes security and 
stability, as well as the importance of family, which in astrology is one of the themes associated with 
Jupiter in Cancer, a combination in effect from mid-2025 through mid-2026. It is meant to evoke a 
Cancerian sense of nostalgia and connection to the past.
The dream of owning a home and raising a family has been a significant challenge this decade for 
younger adults. The peak of this challenge—and the height of polarization among different classes 
and demographics in society, divided by age, race, gender, nationality, and political leanings—may 
very well be taking place right now, during the Aries Vortex and at the midpoint of the New Aira. The 
symbolism of this year’s book cover, therefore, conveys hope for the future: the creation of a new 
foundation of normalcy that offers the next generation the opportunity to live a fruitful, peaceful, and 
secure life.

 ABOUT THE 2026 INSIDE FRONT COVER
This design was created by Kat Powell. It is titled “How Much Time?”
Here, you see a crust of the universe cracking open. The universe is beautiful, but it also conveys 
an image of coldness—an Ice Age, perhaps even the warming of the Earth and the melting of its sur-
face. The crack in the surface, however, reveals an entirely new reality of beauty: another universe 
altogether, radiant with splendor.
This is like our MMA concept of cycles within cycles. Every cycle is part of a larger cycle, and 
within every cycle, there are smaller sub-cycles. Here we have our “known universe,” which turns out 
to be only an appearance—an illusion—that contains yet another larger and more infinite universe. It 
is one that we are only just beginning to experience and comprehend. Our whole model of reality, of 
life as we have known it, is thus transforming as we enter this “New Aira” of knowledge and under-
standing about our world, our universe, and even our universes (plural).
In a way, the transition of the front cover—illustrating the past, present, and future—is meant to 
flow into an even deeper aspect of the unknown future being revealed to us as we are teleported into 
the middle of this New Aira. It is especially crucial right now during the 2025-2026 “Aries Vortex,” 
which is a funnel involving all four outermost planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) in a con-
figuration that focuses on the vernal equinox point of 0° Aries. This celestial phenomenon has never 
before been experienced by our planet Earth. 
It reveals an entirely new reality, direction, and way forward for humanity. We know something 
huge is underway, but we don’t yet know quite how it will turn out. The “opening” shown in this 
image illustrates that it is only beginning to be revealed to us. There is still more of the future to 
unfold, or “open up” to us as the image suggests. 
“How much time” will it take before it opens enough and we finally “see the way”?
That is the challenge of our annual Forecast books. This year’s edition begins to reveal the nature 
and purpose of the Aries Vortex, within the greater period of this New Aira—a term coined in 2020 
by the artist featured here, Kat Powell. 
As you read the following pages, may you begin to understand where we are and where we are 
headed. Enjoy this year’s journey back to—and into—the future.

 THE TRADITION OF THE ANNUAL Forecast BOOK
The first Forecast book I wrote was in 1975, for the year 1976. Thus, Forecast 2026 represents 
a historic personal milestone: the 50th consecutive year of this annual almanac! Who would have 
guessed this would be the case when I started in 1976? Never underestimate the endurance of one 
with both the Sun and Moon in Capricorn!
When I began, I was unaware of any other annual astrological almanacs being written. There may 
have been, but if so, they were not well known. In fact, in 1975-1976, I was not very well-known 
either. I hadn’t even experienced my first Saturn return. But all that changed by the end of 1976.
Today, thousands of copies of the annual Forecast book are distributed each year in several dif-
ferent languages. But the historical tradition of an annual astrological almanac is even more remark-
able. I had no knowledge of this tradition until I spoke with Dr. Christof Niederwieser of Rottweil, 
Germany, who now lives in Switzerland. In my opinion, Christof is one of the world’s foremost 
mundane astrologers. He is also a noted astrological scholar, researcher, and historian. From 2018 to 
2020, he was invited to serve as a visiting fellow at the University of Erlangen, where he wrote two 
prognostication books of his own. In his research, he uncovered a wealth of scientific literature on the 
history of astrology—specifically, the history of astrological almanacs.
He notes that shortly after Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1454, interest in 
astrology exploded. This was largely due to the popularity of annual almanacs, which continued to 
grow and peaked between 1580 and 1610. The most popular of these almanacs achieved print runs 
of up to 50,000 copies a year! 
Afterward, a slow decline set in. The fall of astrology was largely due to the many sensational 
but incorrect predictions made by astrologers in prior decades to boost sales with spectacular head-
lines of impending cataclysms. This had been exaggerated, especially during the Thirty Years’ War 
(1618-1648). The major event that made the public very skeptical of astrology was the solar eclipse 
of August 1654. Astrologers debated whether this eclipse would be a full or a partial one. People 
concluded: if astrologers could not even distinguish between a total and partial eclipse, how could 
they predict wars, famines, weather, and the like based on celestial factors like an eclipse? It didn’t 
help that many predicted a great flood that would wipe out vast parts of Europe—a flood that never 
occurred. Thus began the decline of astrology and the annual astrological almanacs in Europe. How-
ever, the tradition was rekindled several years later in other countries, including England and the 
United States. Benjamin Franklin, for example, wrote a yearly almanac that became very popular.
So here we are, more than 200 years later, reviving this ancient tradition in astrology—hopefully 
in a meaningful and ethical way, with a better outcome than what our ancestors devolved into in the 
mid-1600s. To quote Niederwieser in a personal e-mail on the subject: “Yes, you are definitely in an 
honorable tradition with the yearly almanacs!”

 ACCURACY AND PRECISION: LIMITS TO FORECASTING
An astrologer, or one who uses the study of astrology to make forecasts or even predictions, is not 
the same as a psychic or clairvoyant, despite often being lumped together by those who do not under-
stand the difference. One uses objective means to make forecasts, while the other relies on subjective 
means. An astrologer is capable of providing probabilities for forecasts based on historical facts and 
frequencies of occurrence, while a psychic or clairvoyant is not. Both may at times make forecasts 
or predictions based on personal observations and experiences, but that is not the same as providing 
evidence-based studies supporting probabilities derived from past frequencies of repetitive patterns.
An astrologer examines the relationship of the planets to one another. Planets are also analyzed 
according to their relationship to the equinoxes and solstices. The vernal and autumnal equinoxes 
mark the beginnings of the signs Aries and Libra (spring and autumn as measured by the Earth’s orbit 
around the Sun). The solstices are identified as 0° Cancer and 0º Capricorn, or the start of summer and 
winter, based on the Earth’s orbital cycle. These are the points by which seasons are measured, which 
is also how much of human activity is organized. When a planet—or the Sun, in the case of a geo-
centric perspective—crosses one of these points, it begins a “cardinal sign” (Aries, Cancer, Libra, or 
Capricorn) for approximately the next 30 degrees of spatial arc. In the case of the Sun, it will remain 
in that cardinal sign for approximately 30 days. The next 30 degrees represent the “fixed signs,” or in 
the case of the Sun, the middle of the season. The last 30 degrees represent the “mutable signs,” or in 
the case of the Sun, the change of the seasons.
Each of these planets and signs has different dynamics. They relate to different themes and dif-
ferent aspects of human experience or nature. For instance, some planets, including the Sun and 
Mars, are “hot.” Hence, the signs they rule—Leo and Aries—are also “hot.” They are known as “fire 
signs.” Thus, when “fire signs” are activated, there is much energy on Earth, but tempers can also 
flare, which in turn can lead to conflicts and threats of war. This can also correlate with hotter-than-
normal temperatures, which may lead to droughts and famine. Now, a psychic might be able to claim 
to know which influence would dominate under a gathering of several planets in fire signs—war or 
droughts. But an astrologer, at best, might forecast one or the other, or perhaps state something like: 
“These placements can suggest the possibility of either a drought or war.” The astrologer cannot be 
certain exactly which type of event will unfold, but can suggest with confidence the themes involved 
and the types of events that may correlate with those themes. 
Furthermore, the astrologer can accurately identify “when” these themes and possible events are 
most likely to occur. A psychic or clairvoyant cannot consistently do this, although some may claim 
they can. Without astrology, their subjective vision of the future often lacks accuracy in predicting 
the timing of events. 
This brings up another difference between the two often-confused practices. An astrologer 
observes outer cosmic movements. It is an objective study in its own right. The interpretation of 
those movements may be subjective, but the timing is objective. This is not the case with psychics or 
clairvoyants, whose analysis is purely subjective, based on a “feeling” or “vision” they experience 
when in the presence of a client.

## Page 12

In many cases, an astrological delineation of a chart may be misunderstood by those who 
think astrology, or the astrologer, “missed something” or was inaccurate because a specific event 
suggested did not happen. In other words, the narrower or more specific an astrologer’s inter-
pretation of a geocosmic signature, or even its timing, the more likely it will appear inaccurate. 
Astrology, in its purest interpretation, must allow for a wide range of possibilities to accurately 
reflect the meaning of a particular signature. This is important because the highest role of an 
astrologer is to help the client better understand the possibilities before them, so they (the client) 
can make informed choices in their life. The broader the communication of the themes and dynam-
ics involved, and the wider the timing of possible events under those themes and dynamics, the 
more accurate the astrologer will be. For instance, if an astrologer forecasted that between 2020 
and 2025 the price of Bitcoin would be higher, that forecast would have been 100% accurate. But 
that is a very wide time band and would have missed the 80% price decline from November 2021 
through November 2022. If that astrologer had said the price of Bitcoin would be higher every 
year between 2020 and 2025, the prediction would be inaccurate because of the collapse in 2022. 
The same would be true with stocks. One might say that stock indices will be higher every 
ten years. That is, if you invest in a stock market index at any time, the value of that index 
would be higher ten years later. That prediction is often used by salespeople of financial funds 
and would be correct—except after the high of 1929, when it took more than 20 years for stock 
markets to regain their value from the September 1929 peak. Is this type of prediction, with very 
broad and ten-year time bands, helpful? Perhaps it is for one who is very patient. Or would it be 
more helpful—and profitable—to know that during a certain year or period, the stock market has 
a high historical frequency of dropping at least 20%, or even 35% or more, according to histori-
cal evidence? An investor might be better off waiting for such a decline before investing in the 
stock market when it is making a new all-time high. There are arguments to support both sides 
of this question.
However, the point is that there are limits to the degree of accuracy an astrologer can provide, 
especially when dealing with something as volatile as a financial market or a political trend. The 
best one can do is share the research—historical studies based on evidence that can yield prob-
abilities about the future, drawn from what has transpired in the past under the same or similar 
geocosmic signatures or cyclical time bands, especially when they overlap—and then make a 
projection of what that indicator suggests about the present or future. If the forecaster provides 
evidence of past correlations, and the market does not repeat this time as it did in the past, does 
that mean the astrologer or market timer was wrong? Or does that simply mean this was one of the 
fewer than 20% of instances in which a particular cycle didn’t happen as it had before?
This is what an ethical astrologer can do: provide historical evidence and make a projection 
based on that evidence when the same indicators appear again. The examples above illustrate the 
limits of forecasting accuracy. The more specific the forecast is in terms of an event rather than 
a theme, the more likely the astrologer is to miss other dynamics that could unfold according to 
astrological principles. The more specific and narrower one is in forecasting a turn in a long-term 
market trend—a turn with a wide time band relative to the length of the cycle being examined—
the more likely one is to miss it. A financial astrologer can, for instance, demonstrate that an 
18-year U.S. stock market cycle has occurred 100% of the time within a 13- to 21-year interval 
since the market was founded in 1792. However, if the astrologer states unequivocally that it will 
happen in a specific year—say, 2026—that prediction has only a 12.5% chance of being exact (if 

## Page 13

given in 2021). In fact, every year in that 8-year time band has a 12.5% probability of being the 
exact year of the cycle. If one allows the entire time band to represent a possible 18-year cycle 
low, there is an excellent chance of being correct, as this has occurred in all cases so far. But as 
one tries to narrow that time band down to a single year, the odds of being correct begin to decline.
How do we address those odds in an effort to narrow the time band down for such a long-term 
cycle’s culmination? We do this by overlapping smaller cycles, sub-cycles, or “phases” of the 
longer-term cycle. For example, an 18-year cycle might be composed of three 6-year sub-cycles 
or phases that have a normal range of 5-7 years. When the second phase is completed, we add 
5-7 years to that date and see where it overlaps the 18-year cycle. For instance, if the last 18-year 
cycle in the U.S. stock market occurred in March 2009, then the odds are high that the next one 
will occur between 2022 and 2030. If we know that the last 6-year cycle ended in 2022, and in 
over 80% of historical cases this sub-cycle has occurred every 5-7 years, we can project that it is 
next due in 2028 +/– 1 year, overlapping the 18-year cycle time band. This is where the probabili-
ties, based on historical studies, are greatest. But the 6-year cycle is not 100% reliable—it is just 
over 80%. So, if the cycle low does not happen in 2028 +/– 1 year, but instead happens in, say, 
2026 or 2030—still within the 100% historical time band for the 18-year cycle, are we wrong? Or 
is this simply a case of the event happening slightly outside the 80% window? This illustrates the 
limits of accuracy in forecasting. The broader the interpretation and timing, the more accurate it 
will be. However, the broader and wider the timing of the event, the less useful it becomes for the 
reader to benefit from—or profit by.
Efforts to narrow the time band and accuracy of a possible event do not end with cycle over-
laps. This is what distinguishes MMA from most market analysts. We also use geocosmic cycles 
that correlate with historical events and market culminations. The basic rule is this: the longer 
the planetary cycle that is unfolding, the more likely it will coincide with the end of a long-term 
market trend and the beginning of a new one. Likewise, the closer a long-term market cycle is to 
being due, the more likely a long-term planetary cycle will also be in effect. 
Given that the Aries Vortex, for example, is in effect in 2025-2026, and that it is the rarest 
celestial configuration of our lifetime, there is reason to think the all-time highs (the crest of the 
18-year cycle) may be happening now. The crest is due at any time, as is the 18-year cycle trough, 
which is expected sometime before 2030. And since 35-65% declines tend to occur after such a 
long-term bullish trend ends, what should the prediction be? 
More importantly, what should a stock market investor’s strategy be over the next couple of 
years? That question not only illustrates the limits of forecasting but also the value of applying 
these timing methods with an understanding of their odds and importance. If you can avoid buy-
ing when a market is making an all-time high and instead wait for a 37-63% decline that is due 
before entering, which offers a better possibility of long-term profits?
This is why market timing, when used effectively, gives an investor better odds of success. 
You don’t have to be exact in your timing, but it is helpful to know the limits and probabilities. 
Knowledge of cycle studies combined with geocosmics provides this “edge.” It is an edge that all 
traders and investors seek.

Analyst Pouyan Zolfagharnia, who wrote special sections on the outer planet sign ingresses, as 
well as the seasonal ingresses for 2026. The ingresses of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto will serve as 
models of guidance for the next 7-20 years. His historical research and correlation to many of today’s 
global themes are excellent, and in my opinion, elevate him into the top tier in the world of today’s 
Mundane Astrologers. I am proud to have Pouyan’s expertise as an analyst at MMA! Additionally, he 
is a wonderfully warm and kind human being.
