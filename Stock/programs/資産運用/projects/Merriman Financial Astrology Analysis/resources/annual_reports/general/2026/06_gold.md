The appreciation of 3-year cycles has been between 55%–122% with an average of 99%. Based 
on these studies, the price target for the 3-year cycle crest is 29,600 with a range of 23,050–33,050. 
This falls right within the price target range for the long-term cycle of 21,700–49,400, narrowing 
down that range. The current 3-year cycle has appreciated over 60% so far from its starting low in 
April 2025 and has already entered the target price range. We can conclude that the 3-year cycle crest 
price target range is the one to focus on for the 18-year cycle crest as well.
Once the crest is in, the historical range of decline from the crest to trough in 3-year cycles has been 
1–14 months with an average of 6 months. The historical depreciation has seen a range of 11%–49% 
with an average of 30%. Moreover, from our studies, we know that the last phase of a greater cycle often 
retests the second phase low. In the case of the 9-year cycle, that would be the low of October 2022, 
which, from the current highs, would represent a 55–60% decline. In case of the 6-year cycle, this would 
be the low of April 2025, which, from the current highs, would represent a 35–40% decline.
The 50-Week Cycle
The 3-year cycle in the NASDAQ further breaks down into three 50-week cycles, when it unfolds in 
a 3-phase pattern. Historically, in 80% of the cases, the 50-week cycle has a normal length of 50 weeks 
with a range of 35–65 weeks. If the 50-week cycles are on the longer side, then a 3-year cycle can also 
break down into two 50-week cycles, as in a 2-phase pattern. Another possibility is a breakdown into a 
combination pattern, in which we would see lows at the 1/3 and 1/2 intervals of the greater 3-year cycle.
Measured from its start in October 2022, the previous 3-year cycle broke down in a 3-phase 
pattern with 50-week cycle lows in October 2023, August 2025, and the third and final low in April 
2025. As of this writing in November 2025, the current 50-week cycle, measured from its start in 
April 2025, has progressed 30 weeks. The next 50-week cycle trough is due in March 2026, with a 
range of January 2026 – May 2026, when a 1/6 orb of the normal length is applied. If the orb of 15 
weeks is applied, the 50-week cycle trough range increases from December 2025 to July 2026.
The current 50-week cycle seems to be breaking down in a 3-phase pattern. Currently, we are 
only in the second phase of the 50-week cycle. Historically, in 80% of the cases, 50-week cycles have 
rallied between 22–65 weeks from trough to crest with an average of 43 weeks. Thus, we are already 
in the range for the crest. However, since this is only the first 50-week cycle in a new 3-year cycle 
and the first 50-week cycle usually exhibits bullish characteristics, I expect the crest to form within 
the second or third phase, which would be December 2025 through March 2026. The appreciation 
from trough to crest has historically ranged from 18%–73% with an average of 39%. Measured from 
the starting trough in April 2025, this gives us a price target range of 17,500–25,700 for the current 
50-week cycle, which has also been achieved as of this writing. 
Once the crest is in, in 80% of the cases, 50-week cycles have declined from the crest to the 
trough for 4–38 weeks with an average of 13 weeks. The historical depreciation from the crest to the 
trough ranges from 8%–34% with an average of 18%. Thus, we anticipate an 8%–34% drop in the 
NASDAQ in the first half of 2026.
GEOCOSMIC INDICATORS
During the years 2026 until 2027, there is an abundance of geocosmic signatures happening that 
have relevance for timing market cycles. I will focus on the overlap period of the identified market 
cycle time bands in the previous section.

Let’s first look at the critical reversal dates for 2026 that are specific to the NASDAQ. Critical 
Reversal Dates are high-probability market turning points identified through proprietary algorithms 
by Jonathan Jairaj and Wiebke Held, based on the correlation of market and planetary cycles in the 
NASDAQ for the past 40+ years. The methods to derive the CRDs are built upon The Ultimate Book 
on Stock Market Timing Volume 3: Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles, by Raymond Merri-
man, and have been further enhanced to improve prediction accuracy for the NASDAQ. 
CRDs are ranked by correlation strength, with three-star CRDs signifying the highest probability 
for cycle crests or troughs to form. There are six three-star Critical Reversal Dates (CRDs) in 2026 
for the NASDAQ:
	
January 20 (+/– 4 trading days)
	
March 22–25 (+/– 4 trading days)
	
June 15 (+/– 4 trading days)
	
July 20–25 (+/– 4 trading days)
	
September 15–25 (+/– 4 trading days)
	
October 3–November 14 (Venus Retrograde)
Together with the cycles analysis from the previous sections, these CRDs narrow down the 
time bands for when to expect major turning points in the NASDAQ in 2026. As we expect a 
50-week cycle crest and trough in the first half of 2026, watch for the 50-week cycle crest and/or 
trough culminating around the first three CRDs (January 20, March 22–25, June 15). Even though 
it is not my preferred scenario, we must be open to the possibility that the first 50-week cycle crest 
may also be the greater 18-year cycle crest. This would be supported by the following long-term 
geocosmic signatures:
Saturn–Neptune
Conjunction
February 20, 2026
Level 1
Saturn–Pluto
Waxing Sextile
Mar 28, 2026
Level 1
The Saturn–Neptune conjunction and the Saturn–Pluto waxing sextile correlate to more interme-
diate-term and long-term cycle crests than troughs, according to The Ultimate Book on Stock Market 
Timing Volume 2: Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles, by Raymond Merriman. As the 
March 22–25 CRD is overlapping with the Saturn–Pluto waxing sextile, I cannot rule out the pos-
sibility of a significant long-term cycle crest forming in that period.
From a long-term cycle perspective, there is quite a remarkable geocosmic cluster right in the 
middle of the year between July 15–25. The cluster contains the following geocosmic signatures:
Uranus–Neptune
Waxing Sextile
July 15, 2026
Level 2
Uranus–Pluto
Waxing trine
July 18, 2026
Level 1
Jupiter–Pluto
Opposition
July 20, 2026
Level 1
Jupiter–Neptune
Waxing trine
July 20, 2026
Level 2
Jupiter–Uranus
Waxing Sextile
July 21, 2026
Level 3
Neptune–Pluto
Waxing Sextile
July 25, 2026
Level 1

Except for the Jupiter aspects, all the aspects are directly involved in the “Aries Vortex” formation, 
as introduced by Ray Merriman in the Forecast 2024 book. One could view the Jupiter aspects to Pluto, 
Neptune, and Uranus as an additional trigger to the “Aries Vortex.” Moreover, these signatures are 
happening within only 10 days of each other and thus form the strongest geocosmic cluster of the year. 
According to our NASDAQ CRD studies, these geocosmic signatures are highly relevant and 
correlate with reversals in the NASDAQ as indicated by the July 15–25 CRD. This period would 
certainly provide the geocosmic backdrop for an 18-year cycle crest to form, as all these signatures 
also tie into the larger, long-term picture. This is my preferred scenario for the 18-year cycle crest to 
form. It’s not my bias that we will see the 18-year cycle trough form within the July 15–25 period. 
However, should we see a decline that exceeds 34% within this timeframe, then it is a possibility.
Another consideration for the 18-year cycle trough is the Saturn–Uranus synodic cycle, which 
has one of the strongest correlations, if not the strongest, to long-term market cycles in the NASDAQ. 
Readers should be aware that the extended time band for the Saturn–Uranus waning semi-square, 
which has three passages in April 2027, October 2027, and January 2028, starts in July 2026 and 
lasts until October 2028. The central time band is from March 2027 until February 2028 and overlaps 
nicely with the hot zone for the 18-year cycle (June–August 2027).
Thus, my bias is that we will not see the 18-year cycle trough in 2026, but rather in 2027, as there 
will be another geocosmically-charged period in June 2027 that would fit better with the 18-year 
cycle trough time band. It contains the following geocosmic signatures:
Uranus–Neptune
Waxing Sextile
June 6, 2027
Level 2
Uranus–Pluto
Waxing trine
June 15, 2027
Level 1
Neptune–Pluto
Waxing Sextile
June 28, 2027
Level 1
Again, all aspects in this cluster are part of the “Aries Vortex.” More importantly, it falls right into 
the “Hot Zone” overlap of the 18-, 6-, and 3-year cycles. Hence, from a cycle and geocosmic study 
point of view, an 18-year cycle trough falling within this cluster is the preferred scenario.
The “Jupiter Effect” (updated by Pouyan Zolfagharnia and calculated by Sergey Trassov) is 
another study to mention here. It suggests a possible steep decline when Jupiter is moving towards 
mid-Leo. Jupiter will be in the sign of Leo from June 2026 until July 2027, which overlaps with both 
geocosmic cluster zones in 2026 and 2027 and further supports the outlook of a significant crest and 
trough during that time frame.
And then there is also Venus turning retrograde from October 3, 2026, until November 14, 2026. Dur-
ing the last Venus retrograde period from March 2 until April 13, 2025, the previous 3-year cycle crest was 
tested on February 18, which was only 9 trading days prior to Venus turning retrograde. Only two trading 
days before, on March 2, the market broke below the start of the primary cycle and was rendered bearish 
with a final retest of that structural break on March 3, the first trading day after Venus turned retrograde. 
The 3-year cycle trough culminated on April 7, only four trading days prior to Venus turning direct. 
Thus, in 2026, the Venus retrograde period could correlate again with a crest and/or trough of 
significance. If we don’t see the 18-year cycle crest forming within the June CRD, then watch the 
Venus retrograde period or the September 15–25 CRD closely. Another possibility during this period 
is a retest of the highs, if a crest forms around the June CRD.

CONCLUSION
In the longer-term picture, 2026 will likely witness the 18–year cycle crest. The price target range 
is 23,050–33,050, or if this is exceeded, up to 49,400 (extreme target). Once the crest is in, the decline 
into the 18-year cycle trough will start. This decline will likely last between 1–31 months or 1–15, 
if we take the narrower time band from the 18-year cycle phases (9- and 6-year cycles). The highest 
probability is for the 18-year cycle trough to occur in 2027 or 2028, with a narrower time band from 
February through August 2027 and a “hot zone” of June through August 2027.
In the intermediate-term picture, a 50-week cycle crest is due in the first quarter of 2026 (if not 
already formed by December 2025) with a price target of 17,500–25,700. This crest will be followed 
by an 8–34% decline in the NASDAQ into the first 50-week cycle low of the current 3-year cycle. 
The time band for this low is December 2025 through July 2026, with a “hot zone” between January 
and May 2026. Watch the January 20, March 22–25, and June 15 CRDs closely during this time, as 
those deliver the highest probability time windows for the 50-week crest and trough to unfold. 
The 50-week cycle trough will be followed by another rally into the second half of 2026 that will 
likely last 22–65 weeks with an appreciation of 18%–73%, forming the crest of the second 50-week 
cycle in the current 3-year cycle. The July 15–25 CRD is the ideal geocosmic backdrop for this to 
happen. The question is whether this crest will exceed the first 50-week cycle crest or not, as at some 
point the 3-year cycle will likely turn bearish and start the decline into the 18-year cycle trough.
My preferred scenario is that the crest of the second 50-week cycle will retest or slightly exceed 
the crest of the first 50-week cycle, forming a double top formation. This would signal that the 
18-year crest is likely to unfold in Q2 or Q3, depending on how the cycle count develops after the 
first 50-week cycle trough.
However, if the second 50-week cycle crest rises clearly above the first crest and prices continue 
trading higher, then the 18-year cycle crest is more likely to occur at the end of the second 50-week 
cycle. In that case, we would expect a retest by the crest of the third 50-week cycle, and an 18-week 
primary cycle crest would be expected later in 2026 (Q3-Q4). In this scenario, pay close attention 
to the September 15–25 CRD and the Venus retrograde period (October 3–November 14) for a sig-
nificant long-term cycle crest. All scenarios will continue to be reviewed and refined in the monthly 
MMA Tech Report. 
These conditions would represent a textbook long-term cycle crest with a classic double top 
formation formed by intermediate-term cycles. However, it is important to remember that the final 
phases of a greater cycle most often distort, and the pattern may not unfold in a perfect textbook man-
ner. We are currently in the final phases of all long-term cycles, so the intermediate-term cycles may 
be shorter or longer than their normal length and range, or can even be skipped completely. 
Therefore, if we observe a decline greater than 34% in the NASDAQ, that would indicate the 
decline into the 18-year cycle trough is likely underway. In that event, traders and investors should 
be prepared to buy the long-term cycle trough of the 18-year cycle. Additionally, any intermediate-
term cycle crest that develops in late 2025 or 2026 should be viewed as an opportunity for traders and 
investors to reduce exposure to the NASDAQ and the broader US stock market in anticipation of the 
decline into the 18-year cycle low.

 GOLD IN 2026
by Wyatt Fellows, MMA Analyst
REVIEW 
What an incredible year for Gold in 2025! At the time of writing last year’s Forecast 2025 book, 
we were in the time band for an intermediate low when it was written, “Gold is due for a second 10.5-
month cycle low by November 2024. The price target for this low could be between $2350–$2575.” 
Indeed, Gold bottomed out on November 14 at 2541.50. It then exploded to an all-time high of $4398 
on October 20. This was above even our most optimistic price target mentioned last year, which was 
$3743 +/- 411. Since peaking, Gold is now in the process of correcting back into a 50-week and 
31-month cycle low that is due ideally by the end of January 2026. If a bottom forms, then all eyes 
will be on whether or not Gold can eclipse that $4398 high in 2026.

16-YEAR CYCLE
Gold likely has a 16-year long-term cycle, which aligns well with the lengths of long-term cycles 
in other financial and commodity markets. However, since we only have two observed instances of 
this cycle (three if you consider 1968 as a viable low, as I do), it will take many more years of data to 
confirm this. Until that happens, we will operate under the assumption that Gold has a 16-year cycle 
with a historical 2-year orb. It last bottomed in December 2015, placing 2026 in the 11th year of the 
current cycle. It is next due to bottom in 2029–2033. As we are past the halfway point of the long-
term cycle, we need to be aware that a crest could form at any moment. It could even have occurred 
at the October 2025 all-time high of $4398, but this is not our current bias.
What is interesting about the $4398 high is that it was very close to an exact doubling of the 
rise from the preceding 16-year cycle. Measuring from the double bottom lows of 1999–2001 to 
the 16-year crest of September 2011, Gold rallied $1667. If we double that amount and add it to the 
December 2015 16-year bottom of $1045, we get $4379. The October high of $4398 is within $20 
of this price target, which means it needs to be given some serious consideration for being a 16-year 
high. Right now, our bias is that Gold will make further gains in 2026 before ultimately peaking out, 
but if Gold experiences a monthly close below $2541 before making a new all-time high, then the top 
for this 16-year cycle is probably in. Until that happens, the next upside price targets for this 16-year 
cycle are $5016 +/- 467, followed by $5410 +/- 515.
