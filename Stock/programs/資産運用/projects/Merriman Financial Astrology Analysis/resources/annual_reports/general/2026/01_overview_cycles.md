 BRIEF NOTE TO INVESTORS AND TRADERS IN 2026
This year’s note is directed more to investors than to traders. The reason is that an important long-
term planetary cycle is in force: the 36-year Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20, 2026. Long-
term planetary cycles most often correlate with the completion of long-term market cycles. Further-
more, predicting the exact turn of such cycles within a narrow time band is never easy when a long-term 
planetary cycle is unfolding. There are many possibilities within the orb of influence of such a cycle.
The historical orb of influence for a long-term stock market cycle connected to the Saturn–Nep-
tune conjunction is eleven months. The conjunction is exact on February 20, 2026, which means a 
long-term cycle crest or trough (or both) is due between March 2025 and February 2027. However, 
this can be narrowed down because, in all but one case, the range was eight months or less. This sug-
gests the highest probability for a long-term cycle to end lies between June 2025 and October 2026.
We may be able to reduce this further if we take into account that in July 2025, these two outer 
planets came within just 13′ of their exact conjunction. If that counts, then allowing an 8-month orb 
from that time yields a range of November 2024 to March 2026. The overlap of March 2025 to March 
2026 would stand out as a potential long-term trend change. But it may expand to eight months 
beyond the exact conjunction in February 2026 as well.
What type of long-term stock market cycle is due? As stated in The Ultimate Book on Stock Mar-
ket Timing: Geocosmic Correlations to Investment Cycles: 
The Saturn–Neptune conjunction has a definite correlation to long-term cycle crests. In some 
cases, these cycles were 18-year crests, and in others, they were simply phases of the 18-year 
cycle. Investors may use this signature as an opportunity to take profits on long-term holdings 
if the market is rallying into it, for the probabilities are great that a 4-year cycle will top out 
within the central time band, or close by.
The U.S. stock market is in the time band for its 18-year cycle crest and trough, which extends 
from 2025 through 2030 in the case of the trough, with the crest due before that. But it could also be in 
the time band for a 4-year cycle crest and trough, measured from the low of September 2022. In the case 
of a 4-year cycle, we would anticipate a decline from the high of at least 16%. In the case of an 18-year 
cycle crest, we would anticipate a decline of 35-65%. Since the 18-year cycle will be starting its 17th 
year from the low of 2009, and bull runs to the crest of the next 18-year cycle have historically lasted 
9-20 years, one can see that it is getting very late for the 18-year cycle crest to be completed.
With this in mind, our advice to investors is very simple: start looking for signs to scale back on 
long-term equity holdings or to hedge them in the event that a severe decline is approaching. You may 
also want to begin adjusting your portfolio with the idea that cash will soon be king again. But even 
that is a concern, because the Aries Vortex suggests that the Dollar may continue its decline relative 
to other currencies over the next three years. 
For this reason, investors are advised to consider diversifying their portfolios away from solely 
U.S. dollar-denominated assets and into those backed by other currencies, especially those of neutral 
countries, countries with economies heavily supported by commodities, and stable Asian currencies. 
Once the U.S. stock market declines 37-63%, consider moving back into U.S. equities.

It is possible, but not likely, that each of these cycles will end and begin in 2026. My view, how-
ever, is that investors are well advised to consider protecting their portfolios against a severe decline 
that could very well begin from a high forming within the orb of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction 
crest described above.
I also have a specific period for traders to concentrate on in 2026. This would be in the latter 
half of July (July 15-25), when the transit of Jupiter will form a sextile to Uranus, trine to Neptune, 
and opposition to Pluto. Uranus will also form a sextile to Neptune and a trine to Pluto. These are 
intermediate- and long-term planetary cycles, so they require an orb of up to four months to manifest 
as an intermediate or long-term cycle in various financial markets. But in many cases, such a cycle 
could very well happen within three weeks of this period. Traders are advised to watch for reversals 
in markets that are making new yearly highs or lows, or double tops and/or double bottoms. 
Please refer to the sections on financial markets for further insights, especially the stock market 
and currency sections. Beyond that, keep up with our analysis of these markets through the monthly 
and/or weekly MMA Cycles Reports. The patterns that define the trend status of all cycles can change 
quickly as we move through 2026.

 CHANGING OF THE GUARD:
TRANSITION OF LEADERSHIP UNDER THE ARIES VORTEX
They say ev’ry man needs protection,
They say ev’ry man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.
—Bob Dylan, “I Shall Be Released,” Music from Big Pink (The Band, 1968)
Worry and anxiety are only a matter of the time it takes us to adjust to the Truth. 
—Damien Simpson and Ray Merriman interview, Universal Mind Science, Hollywood, 
California, early 1980s
I have never lived in a time when the U.S. was not the world’s dominant superpower. 
I have never lived in a world where the U.S. Dollar was not the dominant standard world currency. 
I have never lived during a period when the U.S. did not have strong allies throughout the world 
who trusted it to be the leader of world order and global security. 
However, that is all changing as we enter the midpoint of the “New Aira” of 2020– 2032, which 
just happens to coincide with the “Aries Vortex” of 2025–2026.
What is this “New Aira”? What exactly constitutes an “Aries Vortex”? And what correlation do 
these two extremely rare cosmic developments have with great changes in the world order? Can any-
thing be done to affect how these changes unfold?
Let’s review the larger New Aira cycle first. On December 21, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn conjoined 
at 0° Aquarius. This synodic cycle occurs approximately every 20 years. For roughly 200 years, those 
conjunctions take place in signs of the same element, with slight distortions near the beginning and 
end of each 200-year interval, when the series crosses the boundaries between elements. Between 
1802 and 2000, for example, the conjunctions occurred mostly in earth signs, except in 1821, when 
the cycle reverted briefly to late Aries, and in 1980–81, when it leaped forward to the air sign of 
Libra. In 2000, the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn returned for one final occurrence in the earth 
sign of Capricorn. 
The air-sign era is now underway with the Jupiter–Saturn conjunction in Aquarius on December 
21, 2020. From 2020 through 2199, eight of the next nine Jupiter–Saturn conjunctions will occur 
in air signs. The air element of this synodic cycle has not been dominant since the 13th century, or 
approximately 800 years ago. Thus, as coined by market analyst and astrologer Kat Powell, we are 
now entering the “New Aira” cycle of the “Great Chronocrator,” a term often used to refer to the 
Jupiter–Saturn cycle.

## Page 18

Of greatest importance right now is the first 12 years of the New Aira, or 2020–2032. This is the 
interval of time that it will take Jupiter to return to 0° Aquarius, the point from which the New Aira 
began. These 12 years will unfold as a sub-cycle within a greater cycle. It will likely take that long for 
humankind to begin to fully understand the New Aira transformation it is undergoing. It will take that 
long before the application of these new understandings registers in a meaningful, transformative, 
and enduring way—one that elevates human consciousness and clarifies the direction of the human 
experience. Until then, we are still learning what it means and how to use this new knowledge wisely.
We already have a glimpse of the New Aira that is emerging and how it might manifest over 
time. Aquarius rules innovation, particularly in technology. One of the major themes associated with 
Aquarius is revolution and renaissance. In the past several Forecast books, it was noted that this 
would be a period of technological renaissance—and indeed it is. Yet we do not know quite yet how 
it will ultimately affect life on this planet. We see incredible possibilities. But there are also fears 
that it may lead to an ominous, even destructive, outcome for humanity. Will we be able to harness 
the power of this technological renaissance and use it constructively to improve life as we know it? 
Or will world leaders and other bad actors harness it first to control or destroy those they perceive 
as enemies? Answers to these questions during this first 12-year sub-cycle of the 200-year New Aira 
should begin to emerge as we continue through this period of transition.
Sub-cycles are also known as phases. Just as this 12-year period is a sub-cycle, or phase, of 
the greater 200-year New Aira cycle, so too does the 12-year sub-cycle divide into two 6-year half-
cycles. And half-cycles can be very dramatic, for they represent turning points in the pendulum swing 
of the greater cycle. 
It so happens that the midpoint of this first 12-year phase coincides with another powerful celestial 
configuration known as the “Aries Vortex.” The course of human activity and leadership is shifting. 
The pendulum of world leadership is swinging from the West back to the East. America’s standing as 
the world’s leader is vulnerable to being replaced by leadership from the opposite hemisphere—to a 
degree never experienced before by most people alive today. Will this change actually take place? Or 
is this just a temporary threat to the status of the U.S. that will reverse shortly? Will its currency, the 
U.S. dollar, survive this threat as the de facto global currency used for most world trade? If so, how 
will the U.S. regain its economic leadership? If not, where will that lead the U.S. and other nations of 
the world? Who will emerge as the new leader?
These are the questions—even the challenges—that the U.S. and the world face as we enter the 
midpoint of the first 12-year phase of the New Aira. These are the realities coming to light as we 
enter the Aries Vortex. Nothing is quite the same. The world in this New Aira is filled with danger and 
uncertainty—a classical representation of Saturn conjunct Neptune in Aries. Yet it also offers incred-
ible opportunities. Where there is fear, there is also opportunity for those who are alert and able to act 
in accordance with the changes signified by these times.
For investors, this is a time to consider broadening one’s perspective—and one’s portfolio—to 
include the rise of new world leadership and assets backed by the currencies of these emerging world 
powers. In fact, the currencies themselves may change significantly, shifting from paper fiat to something 
more representative of this New Aira that began with the Jupiter–Saturn conjunction at 0° Aquarius. 
This is a techno-renaissance—and its currency is digital. It’s only a matter of time before we all 
need to adjust.

 2026 AND THE ARIES VORTEX:
FEAR AND THE RE-IMAGINATION OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That’s how it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That’s how it goes
Everybody knows

Welcome to “Crazy Times 2026.” 
This is the time of the long-anticipated “Aries Vortex,” an extremely rare celestial configuration 
centered on—and linked to—the Saturn–Neptune conjunction in the very first degree of Aries. Aries 
itself is the very first of 12 signs and marks the beginning of the world cycle according to astrology, 
the world’s oldest discipline exploring the correlation between cycles in the cosmos and cycles in 
human activity.
Why are these “Crazy Times”? Because Saturn and Neptune correspond to more terms used in 
abnormal psychology than any other two planets. They represent very opposite dynamics, such as 
fear and hope, guilt and forgiveness, delusions of grandeur and persecution, certainty and disillusion-
ment, mania and depression, irrational exuberance and panic. And in the first degree of Aries, this 
setup indicates a monumental shift from the end of one long-term cycle (Pisces) to the beginning of 
a new one (Aries). That is, Neptune only crosses into Aries every 164 years. Saturn does the same 
approximately every 29 years. The two planets conjoin one another every 36 years. But how often do 
these two planets conjoin one another right at the end and beginning of the 12 signs? Our database 
only goes back to about 4000 BC, and there are no instances of this same cosmic feat during that time. 
Some astrologers have suggested that this cosmic configuration happened at some point between 
4000 and 8000 BC, but I cannot confirm that.
To understand why the Aries Vortex of 2025–2026 is akin to “crazy times,” consider two things: 
(1) what is happening today, and (2) the principles associated with Saturn and Neptune, combined 
with the classic principles of Aries versus Pisces, the beginning of the cycle of signs versus the end 
of that cycle. In this case, it is not just an ordinary cycle but a very, very long one—over 4000 years 
in duration, at least. 

## Page 20

16
We must also take into account that the other two outermost planets—Uranus and Pluto—are 
in a favorable trine aspect, with their midpoint also crossing back and forth over 0° Aries, the very 
point of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction. These may seem like “crazy times” because they are 
unfolding under a geocosmic configuration that humanity has never before seen or experienced. 
Cosmic patterns this rare will usher in global changes of great magnitude, and life may seem so 
different that it feels a bit “crazy.”
As we consider what has transpired already during the “orb of influence,” which began in 
early 2025 (when Saturn and Neptune entered Aries, followed by Uranus entering Gemini, and 
shortly Pluto finally entering Aquarius in November 2024), it is apparent that vast transforma-
tions are underway across multiple sectors of human activity. Figuratively speaking, everything 
that is supposed to be up has turned down, and everything that would normally be expected to 
turn down has instead turned up. What was previously regarded as diplomacy in the pursuit of 
world peace and global order has instead become driven by coercion and land- or money-grab-
bing, with little regard for consent or fairness toward those affected. The belief that “might is 
right,” and therefore entitles one to dictate the course of civilization rather than cooperate toward 
win-win outcomes and mutual benefit, has become the “new normal” of global leadership. This 
reflects one of the many expressions of Saturn in Aries (“the bully”), which will remain largely 
in effect through April 13, 2028. 
On a more positive note, Saturn in Aries can also represent superhuman efforts to build sys-
tems and structures that stand the test of time. However, this process is unlikely to unfold without 
resistance and struggle. Hence, there is often a challenge to authority and dominance. And without 
mutual respect among all parties involved, this can lead to conflict, or even the threat of war, where 
those with the most “might” can claim superiority and the mantle of power.
Yet it is not just Saturn in Aries that indicates the harsh challenges that many experience today, 
especially those who find it difficult to adjust to this new reality (Aries). It is also Neptune, the 
planet of ideals, altruism, and the search for beauty and truth. Those guiding life principles are also 
being challenged. Even those who hold such fundamental religious beliefs as salvation in an after-
life for virtuous deeds committed in this life may find their belief systems challenged.
One example of this cosmic dichotomy between Saturn and Neptune is the very simple con-
flict between hope and fear. Neptune represents hope, or the wish for a “better life,” even a perfect 
life—which, of course, is an illusion that can never be fully manifested on this plane. Yet it is a 
concept that can be imagined and moderated to mean simply a “better life” than the one currently 
being lived. Everyone has Neptune in their chart. Everyone has hope for a better life, a better 
world. For many, this belief is what keeps them going. It is supported by practices such as prayer 
and meditation, which are among the activities associated with Neptune.
And then there is Saturn, the opposite counterpart to Neptune, representing fear or the reality 
that life is not perfect and, in many cases, not even fair. Where Neptune is idealistic and guilty of 
wishful thinking, Saturn is realistic, skeptical, controlling, and guilty of ... well, just plain guilt, 
either personally, for failing to do or attain something, or projecting (blaming) that “failure” onto 
others. Saturn represents boundaries, laws, and rules—the very things that help structure society 
into orderly collective behavior when built wisely and according to a sensible, well-thought-out 
plan. If one violates these boundaries, there is usually a consequence, a punishment, that follows. 
Or at least, that’s the way it used to be before the influence of the Aries Vortex began. Now the 

## Page 21

17
Aries Vortex (especially with Saturn in Aries) wants to return to those basic principles, ensuring 
that everyone is “staying in one’s lane” and not crossing boundaries without harsh reprisals.
Thus, bringing together the two planets ruling “hope and fear” results either in a battle for 
dominance or in a pathway that patiently seeks to integrate the two dynamics in a way that encour-
ages and supports hope while at the same time minimizing the fear (Saturn) of going into the 
unknown (Neptune) or the new (Aries). Everybody wants change (Aries), but nobody wants to 
sacrifice security or the hope for a better future. Everyone wants change to move in a direction 
that is clear, understandable, and easy to adjust, one that provides a sense of self-control and self-
determination. Without these latter qualities, a general sense of confusion arises: a feeling of being 
lost, even helpless, about future prospects. 
This is the downside of Neptune when it struggles to work constructively with Saturn, 
who demands both a realistic goal and an organized plan to achieve it. Without that possibility 
or belief, Neptune’s existence is in danger of falling into a state of hopelessness. One is then 
tempted to give up, surrender, or seek solace in altered states of consciousness. Hence, the rise 
in mental illness and substance abuse to escape (Neptune) the fears generated by the uncertainty 
of reality (Saturn). 
Living in today’s world of epic change is not easy. That is why this period (2026 +/– one year) 
is dubbed “Crazy Times.” 
Yet if one looks at the possibilities of this “New Aira” starting to unfold, one can also train 
the mind to see new possibilities—extraordinary opportunities. Therefore, once Saturn passes by 
as the planet front-running Neptune, the principles of the latter planet will again become visible. 
That is the hope. That is, Saturn is the faster-moving planet and “blocks out” the light of Neptune 
while it approaches and comes into conjunction with Neptune. But after February 20, 2026, Saturn 
begins to separate from Neptune, releasing more of Neptune’s power. Yes, Saturn may still domi-
nate until it finally leaves Aries, the sign also occupied by Neptune, in April 2028. But Neptune’s 
influence grows as Saturn starts its withdrawal from Neptune’s cosmic head and heart. The virtu-
ous Neptunian principle of compassion and care for others begins to express itself again. And as 
Saturn moves from the dominancy of fire-sign Aries into the more comfort- and security-motivated 
sign of Taurus, a return to normalcy—a deportation of “Crazy Times” into something less crazy 
and more humane—is scheduled to commence. In other words, hope about the world and its future 
can and will be re-imagined. A new texture of light, figuratively speaking, will begin to surround 
this planet and its inhabitants.
Let’s now examine various areas of human activity and the possibilities that may be related to 
the Aries Vortex in 2026 and develop an awareness of how to navigate these challenges.

THE FUNNEL OF THE ARIES VORTEX
Figure 1: Aries Vortex, illustrating the Saturn–Neptune conjunction at 0° Aries and the Uranus–Pluto 
trine, whose midpoint is also 0° Aries.
The Aries Vortex is also a funnel, with its apex located at the Earth—specifically, the Earth at its 
vernal equinox point of 0° Aries. 
The broadening sides of this funnel are represented by Uranus and Pluto, which are also in the 
early stages of their ingress into the air signs Gemini and Aquarius. In fact, as they dance across these 
ingress points, they form a 120° trine aspect to one another, which is considered the most favorable 
of all aspects (spatial relationships) between any two planets in the study of astrology. 
The sides of the funnel—Uranus and Pluto—narrow down to their midpoint, which is the apex of 
the funnel: 0° Aries, the beginning of the zodiac, where Saturn and Neptune conjoin in 2025–2026. 
The exact date of their conjunction is February 20, 2026, though they were very close (less than 13′ 
of arc) during the spring and summer of 2025 as well. Thus, to understand the possibilities of this 
historic and unparalleled cosmic arrangement, we need to contemplate the meaning of (1) the Saturn–
Neptune conjunction, (2) the Uranus–Pluto air trine, and (3) the apex of this funnel, which is 0° Aries. 
We start with this last factor. This particular degree, 0° Aries, aligns with the vernal equinox point 
in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. In that orbital cycle, this degree represents the end of winter and the 
beginning of spring (in the Northern Hemisphere, that is—but in either hemisphere, it marks a time 
when day and night are approximately equal in length, just before shifting toward more of one and 
less of the other). Thus, this degree holds great symbolic meaning. 
It is referred to as “the World Degree,” meaning that longer-term cosmic crossings of this point 
represent times of major change on Earth or in the direction of humankind. The longer the geocosmic 

## Page 23

19
cycle involved, the stronger the transition taking place. Therefore, when Saturn crosses from Pisces into 
Aries every 29 years (approximately), it marks an important shift. When Neptune crosses every 164 
years, it symbolizes an even greater one. When both cross this World Degree at the same time, it signi-
fies an enormous shift, as this type of cosmic event has not occurred in more than 4000 years! It is rare 
and therefore very powerful in its capacity to transform the existing order of life as it has been known.
The nature of the shift will reflect the characteristics of the planets involved and of the sign Aries. 
For instance, Saturn in Aries (May 25–September 1, 2025, and then again February 14, 2026–April 
13, 2028) displays a strong drive to build something lasting (Saturn)—a legacy—with a sense of great 
urgency and swift effort (Aries). It wants to accomplish something great in a comparatively short time, 
as if time (Saturn) is running out. There is an underlying sense that “time is one’s greatest enemy.” Yet 
in this rush to get things done, one often encounters great resistance to change and delays in meeting the 
goal (Saturn). It can be frustrating when others do not move as quickly as the builder or initiator of the 
effort would like. The Saturn principle may then come into play, punishing anyone who does not follow 
his or her command or who resists being controlled by the driver of the legacy movement. 
Saturn is the principle of control. Aries is associated with the principle of speed and the sense of 
“me first” or independence. This struggle between control and independence can result in clashes—
even war. Alternatively, it can signify a superhuman feat led by someone who does most of the work 
without relying on others who cannot keep up with the pace needed to complete the project on time. 
In either case, the conjunction of Saturn and Neptune on the World Degree (0° Aries) signals 
that something major is happening. Something on a very large scale is underway, and this change 
will likely come with conflict. Nevertheless, it will probably gather enough momentum to force the 
issue—the change—into something entirely new for humankind to cope with. Perhaps this has to do 
with the technological renaissance now underway, a change in the world’s standard currency, a new 
hierarchy of global leadership, or—most likely—a combination of all of these developments.
The Age of American Exceptionalism may be ending. However, that does not mean the U.S. is 
becoming a “third world” or failed country. It simply means that other nations, such as China and India, 
are growing faster than America and gaining greater status as world leaders. They are advancing more 
rapidly than the U.S. in many areas, but it doesn’t mean the U.S. is declining—only that others are catch-
ing up and, in some cases, surpassing it in their influence over global affairs that for the past century have 
defaulted to America. The question to ask is not whether America is in decline, but rather: Why are other 
countries becoming more and more influential in world affairs? Why are they choosing to trade more 
with one another and less with the U.S.? And why might much of the world’s capital, anchored in U.S. 
dollars, begin to leave the once-secure investment pastures of America for opportunities in other regions? 
The answers, I believe, lie in the nature of basic relationships: trust versus mistrust. When the 
balance of that dynamic is altered in any relationship, the relationship begins to break down. It takes 
a long time to build trust. It takes only a moment—a sudden decision or change of policy—to tear it 
down, and even longer to repair and rebuild it.
We will discuss this further when we examine the chart of the United States and its past and cur-
rent leaders. For now, let us deepen our understanding of this magnificent celestial arrangement, the 
Aries Vortex, and the outer planets that make up its funnel and apex. I will cover the aspects in the 
pages that follow, and Pouyan Zolfagharnia will cover their sign placements as we embark upon this 
remarkable journey into the Aries Vortex of 2026.

 THE SATURN–NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION
Well, we know where we’re goin’,
But we don’t know where we’ve been,
And we know what we’re knowin’,
But we can’t say what we’ve seen.
And we’re not little children,
And we know what we want.
And the future is certain—
Give us time to work it out.
—David Byrne, “Road to Nowhere,” Little Creatures (Talking Heads, 1985), published by WB 
Music Corp.
The synodic cycle of Saturn and Neptune—that is, from conjunction to conjunction—lasts 36 
years. However, the frequency of these two planets conjoining at the first degree of Aries is extremely 
rare, given that there are 360° in each planet’s orbit around the Sun. 
In the next chapters, MMA analyst Pouyan Zolfagharnia will interpret what each planet—Saturn 
and Neptune in Aries, Uranus in Gemini, and Pluto in Aquarius—portends. Here, however, we will 
examine the meaning of and the potential world changes suggested by events that occurred during 
past periods of Saturn–Neptune conjunctions. We will also consider the principles of Saturn and 
Neptune, as known through the study of astrology, and review some historical instances that have 
repeated with similar themes when these two planets have conjoined.
SATURN–NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OF 1989 
The most recent conjunction of Saturn and Neptune is probably vividly recalled by those who 
were adults 36 years ago. This occurred from March 3 to November 13, 1989, when the two outer 
planets conjoined in a three-passage series due to the retrograde motion of both. The middle cross-
ing took place on June 24. All three passages occurred between 10° and 12° Capricorn. We typically 
allow an orb of approximately one year for events related to a long-term planetary aspect to manifest.
The first event to note during this period was the environmental disaster in Alaska on March 24, 
1989, when 42,000 cubic meters of crude oil leaked from the Exxon Valdez oil tanker. In the world 
of finance, Neptune is one of the planets associated with crude oil and the ocean. Saturn is associated 
with loss, and Capricorn pertains to the earth. Thus, the combination of these principles fits an epic 
environmental disaster such as an oil spill in the ocean off the coast of Alaska. 
Therefore, in 2025–2026, we must be alert to potential environmental and ecological catastrophes. 
These might involve floods (Neptune) that threaten human life or abnormally hot or cold temperatures 
that damage the growing or harvesting cycles of food. They may also indicate freezing (Saturn) of 
citrus or coffee fields, or outbreaks of disease caused by parasites infesting and destroying crops.
Next, we note that Apple launched its first portable computer, the Macintosh Portable, on Sep-
tember 20, 1989. This event sparked new creative applications that would influence both the arts and 
the business world, particularly through advances in advertising and marketing. With the world of 
artificial intelligence opening up today, we can anticipate many new innovations and products—much 

## Page 25

like the portable Apple computer—that will drive the technological renaissance currently underway. 
Graphic illustrations are likely to be stunning, both in print and in the digital realm. This creative 
force may also extend into the fields of music and film, which are ruled by Neptune.
However, the most notable event of 1989 was the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9. This 
was one of the most significant moments in modern history, symbolizing the reunification of East and 
West Germany. It also coincided with the collapse of ideological divisions that had separated Europe 
for decades. This event is highly representative of Saturn and Neptune conjunct in Capricorn, as both 
Saturn and Capricorn rule structures such as walls. They also rule authoritarian systems of govern-
ment in which the state exerts greater control over the lives of its citizens. Neptune’s character is not 
only idealistic but also dissolving—it erodes whatever it touches. In combination with Saturn and 
Capricorn, it dissolved an entire system of government—Russian Communism as it was known at 
the time—and, as a result, the Soviet Union came to an end. Russia’s government imploded as more 
than 300 million new consumers entered the free-market economies of the world.
This event eventually led to a great global economic boom that lasted through the following 
decade, highlighted by the internet revolution that connected people from around the world. It ulti-
mately transformed how business was conducted—from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to the 
emerging world of online commerce. Barriers dissolved.
What barriers and boundaries will dissolve in 2026 and beyond?
THE SATURN–NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OF 1952–53
This was another three-passage series, starting on November 21, 1952, and ending on July 22, 
1953. The middle crossing took place on May 17, 1953.
It was also another monumental and transformative period that exhibited themes related to Saturn 
and Neptune, which conjoined in the sign of Libra. According to Google’s AI, “In 1952, the United 
Kingdom gained Queen Elizabeth II as monarch, and Britain developed its first atomic bomb. Glob-
ally, the Mau Mau Uprising began in Kenya, while King Farouk was ousted in Egypt by a military 
coup. The Great Smog of London killed thousands, and the U.S. conducted its first hydrogen bomb 
test [on November 1 in the Marshall Islands], which strengthened the international supremacy of the 
United States in terms of weapons capability. The U.S. Supreme Court also declared a steel seizure 
by President Truman illegal.” 
Of particular interest here is the Great Smog of London, which killed thousands, for Neptune is 
the planet of fog and smog. With Neptune, it is hard to see—visibility can be distorted and things 
become blurred, both literally and figuratively. But smog can also be poisonous and hazardous to 
one’s health, and Neptune rules poisons. 
Thus, in 2025–2026, we may see instances of deadly fog or smog, or poisons in the atmosphere 
that threaten people’s health, or toxins in food or medical injections used in attempts to assassinate 
leaders (or their enemies). 
It is also noteworthy that the United States Supreme Court intervened in President Harry Tru-
man’s attempt to seize control of the steel industry and declared his action illegal. Today, there are 
cases before the Supreme Court alleging that President Trump engaged in similar unlawful efforts to 
assert control over segments of U.S. industry and business.

Most of this particular instance of Saturn conjunct Neptune took place in 1952–1953, which is 
especially interesting from a historical point of view because that was when (1) Joseph Stalin died 
(March 5, 1953), leading once again to a power struggle and the implosion of the Russian government; 
(2) Vladimir Putin was born (October 7, 1952); and (3) Xi Jinping was born (June 15, 1953). According 
to Google’s AI, the year 1953 also witnessed “… the end of the Korean War, the first Soviet hydrogen 
bomb test, the 1953 coup in Iran, and the execution of the Rosenbergs for espionage in the U.S.”
This Saturn–Neptune conjunction period also witnessed the peak of the “Red Scare,” when Sena-
tor Joseph McCarthy’s brutal tactics, false accusations, and life-ruining trials were unleashed on 
those he accused of being Communist spies. By 1954, he was condemned by Congress for “conduct 
that tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute.” Does this sound familiar, given current 
events under Saturn conjunct Neptune? This is a time when witch hunts and attempts to ruin the lives 
of well-known people who disagree with those in authority can take place. Today, this is referred to 
as “hate speech.” Saturn and Neptune together can indicate false accusations and scandals, but truth 
eventually comes to the surface, discrediting the aggressors and restoring the reputations of those 
harmed by such attacks. The problem is that until the truth is known—or agreed upon—both sides 
believe they are being attacked unjustly and seek retribution. 
By the way, the American Heritage Dictionary defines “McCarthyism” as “1. The political prac-
tice of publicizing accusations of disloyalty or subversion with insufficient regard for evidence; and 
2. The use of methods of investigation and accusation regarded as unfair in order to suppress opposi-
tion.” In some respects, this Saturn–Neptune of 2025–2026 may seem like 1952–53 all over again in 
the halls of leading world governments.
THE SATURN–NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OF 1917
1917 was a key year in a crucial decade. This was a decade of change, or, rather, transforma-
tion; of the destruction of what became old orders; and of the replacement of existing currents 
and practices.
— Jeremy Black, “A Nation Must Think Before It Acts,” Foreign Policy Research Insti-
tute, 2017, www.fpri.org.
This was a single-passage event that occurred on August 1, 1917. Therefore, approximately one 
year on either side of this date should be allowed for its influence to manifest in human affairs.
There were three historically significant events in 1917 that relate to themes of today: the Russian 
Revolution, America’s entry into World War I, and the Balfour Declaration with its implications for 
the Middle East.
The Russian Revolution, also known as the Bolshevik Revolution, stands out because it led to 
the birth of Russian Communism. The Russian government imploded as Czar Nicholas II was over-
thrown, followed by a second revolution that put Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks in power and started a 
civil war. According to Google’s AI, “The Bolsheviks, a Marxist faction led by Vladimir Lenin, seized 
power in the October Revolution of 1917, ending czarist rule and creating the world’s first socialist 
republic. The party formally changed its name to the Russian Communist Party in 1918, solidifying 
the link between the revolution and Communism.”
The Balfour Declaration of 1917 was also an important event that relates to what is transpiring 
today. According to Google’s AI, the declaration “…expressed British support for the establishment 
of a ‘national home for the Jewish people’ in Palestine. The declaration also stated that nothing 

## Page 27

23
should be done to prejudice the civil and religious rights of Palestine’s non-Jewish communities. This 
statement is considered a pivotal moment for Zionism and a foundational document for the state of 
Israel, although it also laid the groundwork for decades of conflict in the region.”
In 1918, still under the Saturn–Neptune orb of influence, three more major world events occurred. 
The first was the end of World War I. The second was the eruption of the Spanish flu pandemic, which 
killed 50–100 million people worldwide—the deadliest pandemic in history. In addition, a massive 
liberation movement emerged in Ukraine, seeking to separate from the new Russian Bolshevik gov-
ernment in 1917–1918 and beyond. That struggle for Ukrainian independence from Russia continues 
to this day.
THE SATURN–NEPTUNE CONJUNCTION OF 1882
The Chinese Exclusion Act was approved on May 6, 1882. It was the first significant law 
restricting immigration into the United States. 
—National Archives, www.archives.gov. 
This was another single-passage conjunction, occurring on May 12, 1882. Therefore, it also 
requires an orb of at least one year when reviewing events related to the themes of this synodic cycle.
Once again, the Russian government was in a state of turmoil when Emperor Alexander II was 
killed by a bomb near his palace in March 1881—an act falsely blamed on Russian Jews. Pogroms 
then broke out, inflicting suffering on Russian Jewry not seen since the 17th century. The pogroms 
came suddenly and unexpectedly. 
This period exhibited several themes related to what is unfolding in 2026—especially concerning 
Israel and the Jewish people—as well as tensions between China and the United States and restrictive 
immigration policies in the U.S.
SUMMARY AND COMMENTS
The basic themes suggested by the principles of Saturn and Neptune have manifested strikingly 
well in world events under their 36-year conjunction cycle throughout history, as exemplified by the 
last four instances. It is remarkable how history has, in a very impressive manner, closely repeated 
these themes—not only in the nature of events but also in the specific locations and regions of the 
world where they occurred.
Let’s briefly review these recurring themes and consider how they are once again emerging in 
today’s world as Saturn conjoins Neptune from mid-2025 through early 2026.
•	
Health and possible epidemics/pandemics: A study I conducted and published in Forecast 
2021 revealed that the dominant geocosmic correlation to the ten deadliest pandemics in his-
tory involved major signatures between Saturn and Neptune. In 1918, this aspect coincided 
with the Spanish flu—the deadliest pandemic in human history. Saturn will conjoin Neptune 
again soon. Thus, it is crucial for the world’s population to closely monitor the development 
of any diseases or viruses that may attack the immune system of a large segment of the global 
population. Individuals with weakened immune systems must take extra precautions, such as 
avoiding gatherings where contagion may spread quickly and making lifestyle choices that 
strengthen rather than stress the immune system (for example, taking nutritional supplements 
and getting extra rest). This aspect can also indicate blood disorders or the growth of tumors 
if not addressed in time.

Propaganda and the quest for truth: This challenge has been ongoing for the past several 
years, even as Saturn transited Pisces, the sign ruled by Neptune, from 2023 through to early 
2026. Saturn represents the quest for facts, evidence, and, ultimately, truth. Neptune repre-
sents the search for a higher truth, yet it can also symbolize a conscious choice to avoid the 
truth and even to intentionally misstate, misdirect, or avoid relevant facts in order to create a 
false narrative. It can also involve withholding information and evading disclosures that oth-
ers need in order to make intelligent and well-informed choices. In short, this combination 
can be highly manipulative—even to the point of outright deception—to gain an advantage at 
the expense of others, including the collective, which may ultimately suffer as a result. It can 
foster rumors or false narratives that lead to serious problems of trust. It can also be accusatory 
and ruinous to the reputations of innocent people, as seen during the early 1950s under the 
“Red Scare” led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Here, fear comes into conflict with hope, and 
a pervasive sense of paranoia can grip a nation—or even the world—convincing people that 
the future is bleak and cannot be changed except by following the advice of the propagandists. 
Today, the world is awash in propaganda and false narratives to the point that knowing 
the truth has become a difficult challenge. 
•	
Errors in data and numbers: Saturn represents data and evidence-based facts and figures. 
Neptune represents errors and omissions regarding hard data. It is therefore not surprising that 
many reports containing detailed “estimates” or calculations have been found to be incorrect 
under this signature. For instance, the U.S. Labor Department announced in August 2025 that 
it had overestimated the number of people employed over several months—via the monthly 
payroll figures—by reporting a whopping 900,000 jobs that didn’t exist! Expect more of these 
types of inaccuracies where numerical data are involved. The result is a misrepresentation of 
reality—another common theme under Saturn–Neptune hard aspects—that challenges inves-
tors to make wise long-term planning decisions that are based on accurate data points.
•	
Trust and distrust leading to the dissolution of partnerships and loss of allies:
When the terms of an understanding between allies change without the willing consent 
of the other party, trust turns to mistrust, and the foundation of the relationship begins to dis-
solve. It takes a long time to regain what has been lost through a perceived violation of trust. 
The U.S. has unilaterally changed the terms of its long-standing agreements with other 
nations—including its closest allies—in matters of trade (tariffs) and military support. This may 
be a major reason why many of America’s former allies are beginning to lose faith in the U.S. 
as the moral leader of the free world. The era of American exceptionalism is faltering, in part 
because of policy changes that affect allies without their willing consent. These relationships are 
no longer perceived as “win–win” and mutually beneficial. Instead, they are seen as win–lose, 
where those who do not comply with such unilateral decisions are the “losers.” Since no one 
wants to be a loser, several former allies of the U.S. now seek to strengthen ties with other nations 
that offer better terms—without new or higher tariffs. Hence, there is a loss of America’s standing 
as the world’s moral and trusted leader. This represents one of the downsides of Saturn conjunct 
Neptune in Aries, forming a hard square aspect to the natal position of Venus in the U.S. chart.
•	
Immigration restrictions and isolationism: People wish to enter the U.S. and other nations, 
usually in hopes of a better life and to escape persecution or hardship under the authoritarian 
leadership of their native country. Neptune represents that hope for a better life. But with 

## Page 29

25
Saturn, new laws are often enacted that restrict immigration or make the process of entering 
or remaining in a country extremely difficult. This occurred with the Chinese Exclusion Act 
of 1882 in the U.S., and it appears to be happening again in late 2025 as the U.S. and other 
nations contemplate new and restrictive immigration laws.
•	
Kidnappings, poisonings, and assassinations of political or financial opponents: These 
events often increase under hard aspects between Saturn and Neptune. People simply “dis-
appear” or seem to become invisible—no one knows what has happened to them or who 
is responsible for their disappearance. Assassination attempts have already been increasing 
during the current Saturn–Neptune conjunction period, a trend that may continue into 2026.
•	
Oil spills and ecological disasters or calamities: Neptune rules water, oceans, and oil. 
Saturn represents loss resulting from catastrophes in these areas. Floods and oil spills can 
cause major losses, both financial and environmental. This pattern has been observed during 
previous Saturn–Neptune conjunctions, most notably with the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.
•	
Attacks and persecution of Jews: For some reason, Jews have often been blamed for societal 
problems during Saturn–Neptune conjunctions, subsequently suffering greatly at the hands of 
their oppressors. These acts are the equivalent of “hate crimes,” and once again, the blaming of 
Jews is increasing across many parts of the world. In 2025, Jews are being accused of commit-
ting genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Polls show that majorities of both Jews in Israel and 
Palestinians in Gaza believe the other side is engaged in genocide. Yet there is no evidence that 
the majority of either group actually supports genocide against the other.
•	
Crisis on the seas: Neptune rules the oceans and seas, while Saturn pertains to government. 
Together, they can signify naval or maritime incidents that require government intervention. This 
may be reflected in challenges involving China and Taiwan, or in China’s activities in Cambodia 
and along shipping routes in the South China Sea, where its navy is actively engaged in building 
projects and ports that could be perceived as threats to the U.S. and its allies in the region.
•	
Implosion of the Russian government: In the last four instances of Saturn conjunct Neptune, 
the Russian government has undergone major changes within one year. Something similar 
could therefore repeat, with the Russian government falling into turmoil and a new leader 
emerging. If this cycle repeats, it suggests the end of Vladimir Putin’s rule in Russia by 2027.
Overall, Saturn–Neptune conjunction periods have coincided with times of hysteria, paranoia, 
and fear about an uncertain future. Propaganda has been widespread and has distorted the truth. 
Scapegoats have been blamed and reputations ruined for failures in government and business to 
uphold the moral high ground. Corruption has been rampant, and trust between allies and partners 
has often been damaged to the point that these relationships dissolve. False narratives have led to 
greater polarization and division within societies, even escalating into hate crimes. These are the 
negative ways in which events have unfolded during previous Saturn–Neptune conjunction periods. 
Yet humanity has always recovered from these difficult times, beginning a period of rebuilding that 
led to a decade of peace and prosperity afterwards. 
Can humanity—facing similar Saturn–Neptune challenges today as it has in the past—recover 
from the current dark period of polarity, division, and fear of an uncertain future? Yes. The Uranus–
Pluto trine that defines the boundary of the Aries Vortex funnel supports this possibility.

 URANUS TRINE PLUTO:
CREATIVE DESTRUCTION VIA TECHNOLOGICAL RENAISSANCE
By Raymond Merriman, with research assistance from Daniel Gordon
Jeff Bezos presented an audacious vision to confront one of artificial intelligence’s most press-
ing challenges: its insatiable energy demands. This proposal, “…which outlines the develop-
ment of gigawatt-scale, solar-powered data centers in space within the next 10 to 20 years, 
marks a significant conceptual leap in sustainable infrastructure for the burgeoning AI indus-
try. Bezos’s plan not only offers a potential remedy for the environmental strain imposed by 
current AI operations but also provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of humanity’s tech-
nological expansion beyond Earth. Bezos’s core message underscored the urgent need for a 
paradigm shift, asserting that the exponential growth of AI is rapidly pushing terrestrial energy 
grids and environmental resources to their breaking point. He highlighted the escalating issues 
of pollution, water scarcity, and increased electricity prices stemming from the construction of 
colossal, ground-based AI data centers.”

INTRODUCTION
The universe works in mysterious ways. 
This is a concept—actually, more of a belief—held by students of metaphysics and mysticism for 
centuries. It often defies science and logic when the course of human civilization shifts in ways that 
no one could have foreseen in their specifics. As astrologers, we know when such transformational 
changes can take place, but we don’t always know exactly what form they will take or what will cause 
them. For example, during the Capricorn stellium of early 2020—when Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto 
were joined by Mars in mid-February, all gathering in late Capricorn by mid-March—many mundane 
astrologers forecasted a powerful turning point in global socio-economic and financial conditions. 
Many predicted a recession and economic downturn, which indeed occurred. Some anticipated assas-
sinations of powerful world leaders or threats of major wars—and those, too, came to pass. However, 
to this writer’s knowledge, only one astrologer forecast a deadly generational pandemic that could 
kill millions in 2020. That was André Barbault, who, in 2012, wrote the following:
“Going back to the pandemics and going back to the past century, the four crises of 1918, 1954, 
1968, and 1982 are obvious, the two considerable being the first, the famous ‘Spanish flu,’ which 
is said to have claimed 25 million lives, and the last one marked by AIDS, which is even more 
devastating and continues to be deadly. We may well be in serious danger of a new pandemic at 
the 2020–2021 mark, at the lowest peak of the cyclical index of the 21st century, with the quintet

of outer planets gathered over a hundred degrees, a conjunction Jupiter–Saturn-Pluto can more 
specifically, and even specifically, lend itself to the ‘tissue’ of this imbalance.” 2
The Aries Vortex is a rare and powerful configuration, first formally introduced in my Forecast 
2023 book, though I initially presented this epochal event to subscribers in 2021. It is expected to 
coincide with a profound and monumental shift in human activity during 2025–2027. As discussed in 
those annual books, this would likely mark the height of conflict, polarity, and division among people 
worldwide over differing beliefs and ideologies, possibly leading to wars. It would also be a time 
when the corruption of truth through propaganda by world leaders could control the narrative to such 
a degree that few would know what was real or false, or where this deception was leading humanity. 
At the same time, inventions and innovations in technology would usher in a new renaissance—a 
technological renaissance—as we had forecast. Humanity would face two parallel realities: one of 
wars and destruction, caused by ruthless leaders seeking to maintain power and control through 
coercion, and another of an incredible new future and work environment, spurred by discoveries and 
applications in technology—what we now recognize as artificial intelligence (AI).
It would be a time of great stress, division, and even hopelessness about the future felt by the 
masses. However, we also pointed out that 2026 +/− one year would mark the bottom of this abyss, 
after which the arc of division and polarity would begin to bend back toward unity and healing. 
These reflections offered an optimistic vision of the future, based on the approach and subsequent 
separation of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, the apex of the Aries Vortex. This was a vision—a 
forecast—presented at a time when few believed that the tide of war, polarity, and division could ever 
turn or improve again.
This worrisome direction was amplified by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president in 
November 2024. His first term had been polarizing for American citizens as well as for the allies of 
the United States around the world. And his 2024 campaign did very little to assure people that he 
would suddenly change and become a unifying force, either nationally or globally. It was hard to 
imagine how the nation and the world could heal under his presidency, given the extreme divisions 
that his rhetoric—including the vilification of anyone who challenged or resisted him—had only 
intensified. Yet, as stated at the start of this chapter, the universe works in mysterious ways.
 The cosmos had a message for Earthlings, but they were neither seeing nor hearing it through 
the first three quarters of 2025. Yet the cosmic message was still there. As we wrote in last year’s 
Forecast 2025 book:
For whatever reason many may not understand, Americans have chosen Donald Trump to 
return to the White House and to be the leader of this movement into—and then out of—the 
Aries Vortex. In astrology, it doesn’t matter who the individual leader is. What matters is that 
the nation and world see a path to a successful outcome that eventually brings humanity into a 
greater sense of unity. That is the promise of the Aries Vortex. 
There are two interesting chart patterns. One is a grand air trine between the Sun, Uranus, 
and Pluto, indicating great discoveries and applications in technology. The other is a peculiar 
Yod formation (“Hand of God”) in this and the previous ingress charts. This “Hand of God” 
signature indicates that fate, or karma, may be unfolding, and the destinies of the U.S. and 
other nations are being carried out as a result of (1) its prior actions and (2) the reaction to the 
results of those prior activities. If handled maturely and with a degree of accountability and 

## Page 32

28
acceptance of responsibility, past “offenses” can be rectified. One must be willing to acknowl-
edge one’s role in harmful historical events. To do so can lead to redemption and forgiveness, 
and all parties can bury the past with a sense of closure and of being heard. The hurtful issues 
can finally be addressed, and the parties can move forward together in a spirit of greater trust. 
It sounds unlikely and perhaps impossible. But the cosmos moves in mysterious ways and offers 
opportunities like this during such rare celestial patterns. 
Then, in October 2025—completely unexpected by anyone entering the year—the historic Gaza 
Peace Agreement came about, led by none other than President Donald Trump and besieged Israeli 
leader Benjamin Netanyahu. This unforeseen historic event marked the beginning of efforts to end 
eight decades of hostilities between Israel and its militant neighbors, Hamas and Hezbollah. It was a 
huge event—the beginning of a whole new world, one that finally holds the prospect of peace within 
its vision. Did anyone expect peace to break out in 2025? Yet this event, which could change the course 
of history, fits perfectly with the cosmic principles underlying the Aries Vortex, as outlined last year.
So, let us now examine the properties of the Aries Vortex further—and, in particular, the boundar-
ies that make up the funnel of the Aries Vortex, which are Uranus and Pluto in Gemini and Aquarius, 
respectively. As stated before, these two superpowers are in a 120° waxing (opening) trine aspect 
to one another, which by itself represents a long-term planetary-pair cycle ranging from 112 to 142 
years in duration, due to Pluto’s erratic orbit. Yet what makes this Aries Vortex funnel so remarkable 
is that, at the midpoint of its Uranus–Pluto boundaries lies the Saturn–Neptune conjunction serving 
as the apex of the vortex, which in turn forms a double sextile to both Uranus and Pluto, as shown 
in Figure 1 (in the Aries Vortex section of this book). So far, we have focused mainly on the Saturn–
Neptune conjunction, but equally important is the Uranus–Pluto trine, the midpoint of which is also 
the 0° Aries world point, occupied by Saturn and Neptune.
How rare is this planetary configuration involving the four outermost planets of our solar system 
in such an aspect formation? We have no record of it ever having occurred before. Therefore, we 
will explore what it portends by (1) applying basic astrological principles to both planets (Uranus 
and Pluto), as well as to their aspect (waxing trine) and the fact that they are in air signs, and (2) 
examining parts of this configuration that have occurred in the past to see whether any themes relate 
to current times while also opening up ideas about future possibilities. Specifically, we will examine 
historical periods when either Saturn or Neptune was at the midpoint of a Uranus–Pluto trine, since 
there are no instances when both were at the midpoint. In this matter, astrological researcher Daniel 
M. H. Gordon1 of Oregon (xstarian@gmail.com) conducted a special in-depth study at our request. 
We will share many of his fascinating findings in this chapter.
THE ASTROLOGY OF URANUS AND PLUTO
Uranus and Pluto share many themes in common. For instance, both are strongly correlated with 
major changes and disruptions in life. The difference lies in the pace of that change. With Uranus, 
it is usually sudden and unexpected—spreading like wildfire, suddenly out of control. In the case of 
Pluto, however, the pace of change is much slower, gradually building over time until the collective 
realizes that circumstances must change. The old ways become obsolete and no longer serve a valued 
purpose as they once did. 
One may think of Uranus as revolutionary and new—indicative of a dramatic change that is 
likely to be resisted by those in control. Change comes too quickly for the masses to adjust easily. It 

## Page 33

29
is like a storm appearing out of nowhere and wreaking havoc. With Pluto, the process is more like 
rolling thunder—darkening clouds gathering on the horizon and slowly moving closer and closer. 
You sense something powerful is building, readying to unleash its force.
Whereas the motivation behind Uranus is often revolution, the impulse behind Pluto is reform 
or transformation. With Uranus, there is a thrust toward something totally new and different, often 
driven by an urge for greater freedom and liberation from real or perceived oppression. In the case of 
Pluto, the desire is not so much for something new as it is to remove or terminate something old. Its 
time has come to an end. It is time to move on and build something different, more functional, or at 
least repair that which is no longer working as it should or once did. In this distinction, Uranus rep-
resents something young—perhaps even experimental or original. Pluto, on the other hand, pertains 
to something old, even obsolete, that has reached the point of decline and diminishing returns for the 
well-being of the masses.
MMA Market Analyst Gianni Di Poce likes to refer to the integration of these two principles as 
a force of “creative destruction.” This is an apt description because, in many ways, Uranus is indeed 
creative. At the very least, it is innovative and original. But to get there—with Pluto involved—also 
requires an act of destruction or termination. Through a process of elimination and release, the need 
arises to create something new and more relevant.
Pluto is driven to dismantle that which is no longer functioning well. Perhaps it pertains to some-
thing that has rotted or been allowed to decay—such as an old house, building, or even a system of 
governance. Yet if the powers in control refuse to let it go and insist there is still value in the old ways, 
a natural conflict arises between the young (Uranus) and the old (Pluto, in this case). It becomes a 
generational struggle for power (Pluto) that requires a revolution to overthrow and pave the way for 
a new vision and future to emerge (Uranus). Thus, under the favorable trine aspect, this may involve 
innovation and new discoveries that overwhelm existing systems to such an extent that it becomes 
obvious that new ways must be established. There arises an awareness that there is a much better way 
to do things than before—an organic process of change.
This is the nature of creative destruction. It is also the driving force behind what becomes a 
technological renaissance. We see this unfolding today with the explosion of AI, which has quickly 
reached a level of development where it can now perform many of the routines once carried out by 
the labor force. The work environment is a perfect example of the creative destruction taking place 
across societies worldwide—an evolution that is giving rise to the technological renaissance we 
have been alerting readers to over the past five years. It has been well underway since Pluto entered 
Aquarius in March 2023, though it is still in its early stages.
As a side note, this Uranus–Pluto trine can also provide a cosmic basis for healing the genera-
tional wounds that have persisted since the Uranus–Pluto square of 2012–2015. It was around that 
time that younger generations rebelled (sometimes violently) against older generations, in what later 
came to be called “cancel culture.” In this way, the younger generation refused to allow their elders 
to share experience or wisdom that might temper their disruptive activities. If a speaker from an older 
generation appeared on a college campus, students might force the speaker off the stage, canceling 
the event they deemed offensive based on generational identity or other aspects of “identity politics” 
they opposed. This was a major contributing factor to the polarity and division that led the world 
into the abyss of today’s Aries Vortex. But these wounds can now be addressed and healed now that 
Uranus and Pluto have moved beyond their difficult waxing square into a more harmonious trine. 

## Page 34

There are other sectors of human activity that are likely to be affected by the themes associated 
with both Uranus and Pluto, as well as by the air signs they are just entering. The signs are important 
because Uranus rules Aquarius and therefore disposes Pluto, which now occupies Aquarius through 
2043. Thus, the sign Aquarius—and its ruler Uranus—will stand out for several years. In fact, Uranus 
will be in Gemini, another air sign compatible with Aquarius, through 2032. Therefore, the period 
2025–2032 will be especially characterized by themes of renaissance, technology, innovation, dis-
covery, and revolution. However, there are other themes to consider related to Uranus and Aquarius, 
colored by Pluto’s presence—especially with both planets in air signs, an element associated with 
knowledge and original thought.
Consider that Uranus and Aquarius are both connected with outer space, the realm beyond Earth. 
The importance of exploring and finding applications for outer space is about to explode, largely 
because of the “environmental strain imposed by current AI operations,” as outlined by Jeff Bezos. 
The energy demands required to develop new data centers on Earth have grown as “the exponential 
growth of AI is rapidly pushing terrestrial energy grids and environmental resources to their breaking 
point.” This development complements the concept of creative destruction, which leads to the next 
level of today’s technological renaissance. 
The next step in humanity’s evolution and survival will involve the exploration—and eventually 
the mastery—of outer space, one step at a time. Each step will usher in new discoveries, innovations, 
and insights into this vast realm. With Uranus in Gemini and trine to Pluto in Aquarius, this configu-
ration can guide humanity into a new world of discovery, as illustrated on the inside front cover of 
this year’s book. It will stimulate learning how to utilize outer space more constructively in the next 
stage of humanity’s growth. Becoming an astronaut, or participating in the exploration of outer space 
through commercial or governmental ventures, may rapidly become an exciting profession in which 
demand and compensation could grow immensely over the next six years. This is also an area likely 
to offer excellent investment opportunities. 
As humans expand into outer space to address their burgeoning energy needs, efforts will also 
intensify to extend life itself. Here we have Pluto, the planet of death and rebirth, combining with 
Uranus, the planet of youth and technology, uniting their forces to explore the possibility of immor-
tality. Our current tech visionaries believe the human body is a flawed mechanism in need of a tech-
nological upgrade. Why should it decay, grow old, and die in physical pain? The idea that humans 
can live longer and better through technological advances—such as artificial limbs and decoding the 
human genome to eliminate diseases—is a core tenet of the modern intellectual and cultural move-
ment known as transhumanism. According to Gemini AI, “This perspective is driven by the desire to 
use technology to overcome human limitations, particularly aging and mortality.” This is also a per-
fect illustration of how the themes of Uranus and Pluto in an air trine can operate. Uranus and Pluto 
represent not only the process of creative destruction but also the impulse to discover and invent new 
processes that extend life and enhance well-being as humanity ages.

URANUS–PLUTO TRINES IN HISTORY
The forthcoming Uranus–Pluto trine will unfold in a five-passage series of exact waxing trines 
on July 18, 2026; November 29, 2026; June 15, 2027; January 13, 2028; and May 10, 2028. It should 
also be noted that Uranus and Pluto came within 7′ of one degree of an exact trine in September 2025, 
which is close enough to generate a cosmic influence. Thus, one can assume that the orb of influence 
of this remarkable outer-planet aspect will be in effect from 2025 through 2028. 
For reference, the last time these two planets were in an opening trine was during the three-
passage series from November 9, 1884, through September 21, 1885. It is interesting to note that in 
that instance, both planets were also in the early degrees of air signs (Uranus in Libra and Pluto in 
Gemini). According to Daniel Gordon’s research, “In 1884, the United States was in a period of its 
‘long depression,’ and yet this led to the Second Industrial Revolution. This also coincided with the 
rise of industrial Japan, accompanied by social change. Meanwhile, at the Berlin Conference, the 
European powers carved up Africa into colonies under their rule, developing new trade routes and 
new trading conditions, which led to an immediate economic addition to the asset sheet of the king.”

The time before that was a seven-passage series spanning from August 11, 1770, to April 
29, 1773. This instance involved earth signs (Taurus and Capricorn), which are relevant to the 
masses rebelling against governments whose policies of control were viewed as oppressive. In the 
American colonies, early settlers protested corrupt officials, heavy taxes, and unfair fees. The con-
flict—and the subsequent executions of several Regulators—highlighted the growing tensions and 
resistance to British authority in the colonies. In 1773 America, for instance, the major event was 
the Boston Tea Party, when, according to Gemini AI, “Colonists dumped British tea into Boston 
Harbor to protest the Tea Act, a British law that granted a tea monopoly to the East India Com-
pany and imposed a tax on tea without colonial representation.” This is another classic instance 
combining themes related to Uranus (rebellion, disruption, desire for equality, and independence 
from authority) and Pluto (taxation). “Taxation without representation” remains a rallying cry for 
citizens protesting taxation initiatives by the U.S. government without the vote of its citizenry. It is 
likely a theme that will come to the forefront in the 2026 midterm elections—assuming elections 
take place as scheduled.
There are many prior examples of Uranus in a waxing trine to Pluto, several of which demon-
strate major conflicts between coercion, oppression, and the drive of the masses to free themselves 
from tyrannical forces through rebellion. One such example is the nine-passage series from 1514 
through 1518, which resulted in sweeping transformations across culture, government, and religion 
in Europe. Once again, according to AI, “The period from 1514 to 1518 was a time of significant 
military conflict, the start of the Protestant Reformation, and continued European exploration. Key 
events included the start of the Ottoman-Mamluk War and Martin Luther’s posting of the Ninety-
five Theses.” 
Uranus–Pluto trine periods have also brought forth important inventions that have had a positive, 
transformational effect on societies throughout the world, as one would expect from a trine (favor-
able) aspect. 
In his insightful research, in which he also analyzed the waning (closing) trine of Uranus and 
Pluto, Gordon identified many recurring themes that astrology would ascribe to these two planets, 
especially when both are in air signs. He notes the following: 
There is a disrupted central authority in each of these periods, whether dynastic, papal, or 
imperial. 
Social relationships through economic behavior show that trade routes and economic systems 
change and adapt to new conditions in a positive way. 
These are often crisis periods of change to social institutions and the social contract. In many 
instances, this is a form of war because those with money and power do not willingly give it up. The 
social contract changes when the government changes. 
Taxation, monetary systems, and trade routes all change during these time bands.
 Currency debasement and the collapse of monetary systems raise questions about where to store 
wealth. 
Each time, there seems to be a generational change from the old way of doing things to a new 
way because of economic forces.

In this reshaping and change of power, there is often a military element, the success of which is 
based upon technological advancement. Some people preach separateness, and some preach one-
ness. Those preaching separateness become the dysfunctional ones.
Do any of these themes during Uranus–Pluto trine periods sound familiar today? Gordon also 
points out, “An interesting side note is that from 740 until the coming 2026, there has been only one 
instance when the air trine between Uranus and Pluto (including both waxing and waning) did not 
involve the sign of Aquarius. That was when Uranus in Libra was trine to Pluto in Gemini in 1884–
85. All other times, the sign of Aquarius held either Uranus or Pluto.” 
Indeed, if history is not repeating itself under Uranus–Pluto trines in air signs, it sure sounds like 
it rhymes.
SATURN AT THE MIDPOINT OF URANUS AND PLUTO
Now comes a very interesting study related to Gordon’s research on historical periods when Sat-
urn, and then Neptune, were at the midpoint of the Uranus–Pluto trine. 
In the current alignment, Saturn and Neptune are both at the midpoint of the Uranus–Pluto trine, 
but we have no historical instances to draw from in which both planets were in a double sextile simul-
taneously. Still, studying those periods when either Saturn or Neptune was at the midpoint between 
Uranus and Pluto provides very interesting insights that relate to current times. 
Saturn was posited at the midpoint of Uranus and Pluto, while sextile to each, in 482, 543, 
618, 907, 1255, and will be again in 2025–2026. During these periods, Gordon observed, “…old 
government systems were weakening and collapsing, and new systems were rising but fragmented. 
Laws were being reformed, reordered, and rewritten, and new laws were passed after a period of 
chaos. Money and the economy were usually disrupted because the trade networks and routes col-
lapsed and needed rebuilding. The disruption to human society was noted as a turning point when 
old systems were hanging onto new systems, but the old systems could not remain and were reborn 
into the new system.” 
Once again, this aligns with many of today’s global themes as we enter 2026. Saturn rules laws 
and governments. With Pluto, new rules (laws) are reordered and rewritten in an effort to end chaos 
(Uranus). Trade routes could very well be disrupted, as we see today through the use of tariffs as 
weapons to pressure other nations into meeting specific demands. And yet today we also see the 
advent of new technologies (Uranus) forcing out old systems of governance and practice as new 
systems are created. It has happened before, according to Gordon, and we are seeing it happen again 
today with Saturn at the midpoint of the Uranus–Pluto trine.

Figure 3: Saturn (and Neptune) forming a double sextile to Uranus and Pluto, in effect 
from August 2025 to March 2026. This is an Aries chart set for August 11, 2025. Following 
this period, Saturn begins to separate from its sextiles to Uranus and Pluto, leaving 
Neptune to maintain its double sextile to Uranus and Pluto through 2028.
One point to understand is that, as the midpoint of two other outer planets in a favorable sextile 
to each other, Saturn draws favorable power from both Uranus and Pluto. The government or author-
ity (Saturn), or the entity that controls the situation, receives the combined blessing of power and 
innovation provided by Uranus and Pluto. In today’s case, however, Saturn is in Aries, where it can 
be coercive and demanding, imposing its will over the masses, who do not enjoy that kind of power 
and control. That control could begin to wane as Saturn moves out of the double-sextile formation 
and the collective once subject to its controlling influence begins to regain its power. 
As long as Saturn in Aries (in today’s case) remains at the midpoint of the Uranus–Pluto trine, the 
central authority will have its way—for better or worse. In many cases, conditions in society could 
actually improve if that authority focuses on building enduring structures and systems. Authorities 
may be dominating, but they can also provide many benefits that endure over time.
NEPTUNE AT THE MIDPOINT OF URANUS AND PLUTO
Most relevant to today’s sudden swing toward peace and the end of hostilities in the Middle East 
is Neptune, located at the midpoint of the Uranus–Pluto trine and sextile to each.

## Page 39

There have been three historical periods when Neptune was at the midpoint of a Uranus–Pluto 
trine, as examined in Gordon’s study. These were 476–480, 991, and now again, 2023–2027. With 
Saturn, one would expect attention to focus on governance—and indeed, changes in governance were 
pronounced, as shown in the previous paragraphs. But with Neptune, one would expect major transi-
tions involving religion, the arts, and efforts to end wars and usher in prolonged periods of peace.
In Gordon’s words, regarding the highlights of these three periods: “In each of these times in 
history, there was a decline of the dominant power and a rise of local powers with the local actors: a 
trend to decentralization. There arose new social structures, technology, networks, and trade routes, 
even while the old ones collapsed. Knowledge shifted to new physical centers of collection and hold-
ing. There were new art forms developed in cultural crossroad areas built of old traditions and new 
technology. Finally, religion spread during these times of political change and fragmentation.”
The 476–480 period marked the fall of the Roman Empire—one of the greatest military and 
governmental eras in human history—which began around 750 BC. The year AD 476 is often used 
by historians to mark the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages in Europe. In other words, this 
was a profoundly important turning point in world history. Its themes resonate with today’s possible 
decline of American exceptionalism as the world’s leading power and the concurrent rise of emerging 
leaderships in the Far East, particularly China and India.
The 991 period was also interesting. The “Peace of God” was enacted at the Council of Char-
roux just before then. It was a plan aimed at reducing feudal warfare by limiting private wars to 
certain times of the year and by providing protection for noncombatants. The Peace of God move-
ment relied on the threat of excommunication to enforce its decrees. The Church was all-powerful. 
Also of interest is that in 992 there were notable celestial events: historical records describe major 
auroras observed in Korea, Germany, and Ireland, likely caused by a strong solar event, according to 
Gemini AI. We note that powerful solar storms are erupting now as we leave 2025 and enter 2026. 
Such explosive solar activity tends to correlate with strong changes on Earth—in weather, climate, 
governments, and financial markets alike.
We have only two instances to draw from in the past two millennia. And keep in mind that neither 
Uranus, Neptune, nor Pluto was even known to humans during those times. Yet we can apply our 
understanding of these cosmic themes to what we observe today. Let’s start with Neptune, since it 
is the midpoint between Uranus and Pluto. Furthermore, these are the three outermost planets in our 
solar system, with the longest orbits around the Sun. Thus, we might assume that this could be con-
sidered the most important configuration of all during the lifetime of most people reading this book.
We begin with the idea that Neptune is the planet of peace. Planets represent actions. They are 
more powerful than signs, which represent attitudes and therefore color the actions of the planets 
transiting through them. In this case, Neptune seeks to bring peace to Aries, the sign whose attitude 
is basically “me first” and “I will do what I want, and you won’t stop me.” Aries is ruled by Mars, 
the god of war. So here comes Neptune, the god(dess) of peace, entering the sign ruled by the god of 
war, and saying something like: “I want you to de-escalate your aggression and not be so combative. 
I want you to pull back and use your warrior mentality in the effort to bring peace to the world.” Wars 
that begin—or are underway—when Neptune enters Aries tend to wind down.

Figure 4: Neptune forming a double sextile to Uranus and Pluto (2025–2028), as Saturn begins to sepa-
rate. This is an Aries chart constructed for July 25, 2026. Neptune is the planet of peace initiatives.
Wars are high on the agenda today because Saturn is in Aries and at the midpoint of Uranus and 
Pluto, sextile to each. Saturn in Aries—warlike and bullying—is more akin to Uranus (revolution) 
and Pluto (coercion and reform) than to Neptune (withdrawal and the search for peace). Thus, Saturn 
is presently drawing more from its sextiles to Uranus and Pluto than from Neptune. It conveys an 
attitude of “peace through strength” rather than one of diplomacy, trust, and goodwill. 
But what happens when Saturn begins to separate from its double sextile to Uranus and Pluto 
after March 2026, while Neptune remains there for another two years? Neptune then starts to draw the 
benefits of power from its sextiles to Uranus and Pluto. This creates an entirely different dynamic—
one that bodes well for efforts to end wars and attain peace on Earth. This is the cosmic correlation 
to the sudden (Uranus) emergence of peace in the Middle East after eight decades of hostility and 
conflict, along with an effort to rebuild (Pluto) Gaza as a seaside (Neptune) destination for future 
world travelers.
This is the peak of the Aries Vortex, and possibly the nadir of the abyss of hatred and division. 
It symbolizes the pendulum’s swing from discord and conflict to a period of ten years or more of 
relative peace and rebuilding. This is why I have remained optimistic about the Aries Vortex and

where it will lead humanity. I don’t know how—no one knew how—this would manifest, espe-
cially under the polarizing leadership style of President Donald Trump. But here it is. He gets 
the credit, as it was his individual force of personality, projecting “peace through strength,” that 
brought Hamas and other terrorist organizations to the peace table and started the process of end-
ing the Middle East conflicts over Israel’s right to exist. Love him or hate him, he deserves the 
credit for this manifestation of the positive dynamic underlying the Aries Vortex—something few 
believed possible until now.
SUMMARY
Just as important as the Saturn–Neptune conjunction at 0° Aries in the remarkable Aries Vortex 
configuration is the Uranus–Pluto trine, the midpoint of which is also at 0° Aries. In other words, 
0° Aries forms the apex of both the Uranus–Pluto trine, which defines the boundaries of the funnel, 
and the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, which defines its apex. There has never been a configuration 
like this in recorded history—at least none known to us—involving all four of the outermost planets 
converging at 0° Aries, the starting point of the zodiac, also known as the “world point.” 
When we break down each of these components in terms of their correlation to historical events 
and trends—and attempt to interpret their meaning according to astrological themes and principles—
we find many possible manifestations as we enter 2026. There are so many cosmic dynamics con-
verging within a short period that it can seem overwhelming, both in terms of individual experience 
and in terms of future possibilities for humanity and the planet itself. Nevertheless, the following is 
a partial list of major points that I believe will define human activity over the next year, especially 
those associated with the air trine aspect between Uranus and Pluto:
1.	 Efforts to usher in a new era of peace on Earth lasting at least ten years
2.	 Outer space exploration and development to meet the world’s increasing need for energy, 
which is rapidly approaching overload on Earth
3.	 The quest for immortality and the extension of human life and physical well-being
4.	 New cures for diseases such as various forms of cancer
5.	 Creative destruction leading to the overhaul of obsolete systems and structures
6.	 A technological renaissance transforming the labor market and creating new career opportu-
nities related to outer space
7.	 Decentralization and the collapse of old systems of government
8.	 Revolutions inspired by innovation rather than overthrow or rebellion
9.	 Debasement and transformation of currencies
10.	 Wealth seeking new places to flow, leading to major economic reforms and the creation of 
new trade routes
11.	 Laws reformed, reordered, and rewritten as new legislation follows a period of chaos
12.	 A revival of religion and renewed interest in both traditional and emerging faiths

This is truly a “New Aira” humanity is moving into. And the chaos accompanying these vast 
social, cultural, economic, and governmental changes will require flexibility and a willingness to 
adapt. There are parallel realities unfolding: one driven by forces of destruction and resistance to 
change (i.e., wars), and the other by the power of creation and invention through a technological 
renaissance that will eventually lead to an economic boom—though likely following an economic 
bust. The danger of taking on too much risk is great, but the opportunity for success through well-
considered risk-taking is even greater. Uranus represents risk, while Pluto signifies the potential for 
great loss. Yet, they are in a favorable trine aspect, which bodes well for a successful renewal—even 
if a major financial downturn occurs along the way.
