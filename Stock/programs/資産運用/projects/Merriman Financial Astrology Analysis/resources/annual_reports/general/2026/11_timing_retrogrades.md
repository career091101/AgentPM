 SOYBEANS
REVIEW 
Soybeans followed much the same path as Corn in 2025, except they demonstrated more strength 
by holding up reasonably well into May and June before ultimately falling to a low in August. This 
low could also be construed as a retest of the August 2024 low, with Soybeans beginning to flash 
some bullish price signals as we close out 2025. Last year, it was stated, “If Soybeans can start to 
confirm this (first closing above 1069.50 and then the 36-week moving average at around 1100.00), 
then 2025 looks like it could be a good year for Soybean prices. Watch for 1140.00 to provide initial 
resistance.” It took longer than anticipated, but Soybeans are confirming the above statement with a 
rally to 1150.50 (January contract) at the time of this writing in November.

THE 17-YEAR CYCLE
The longest cycle we measure in Soybeans is the 17-year cycle. It has a range of 14–20 years and 
last bottomed in May 2019 at 791.00. The year 2026 will begin the seventh year of this 17-year cycle, 
which is not due to bottom again until 2036 +/– 3 years. The high so far occurred in the third year 
(2022) at 1784.00. This was essentially a double top to the previous 17-year cycle crest and all-time 
high of 1794.75 set back in 2012. The MCP price target for a bullish 17-year cycle is 2180.50 +/– 
164.00. While this is a lofty price objective, unless Soybeans drop below 791.00, there is still plenty 
of time in this current 17-year cycle for Soybeans to potentially reach this target. 
I am expecting this 17-year-long-term cycle to eventually resolve bullishly in Soybeans. This 
means we would not expect a crest to form before 2027. Having said that, we must respect the fact 
that the high so far occurred in the third year of the cycle and, like Corn, was a double top to the previ-
ous 17-year cycle crest. Until 1784.00 is taken out, there is a chance that the top is in, and this 17-year 
cycle could turn bearish. An early warning that this could be transpiring would be a solid monthly 
close below the uptrend line depicted on the monthly Soybean chart. 
THE 8.5-YEAR AND 5.5-YEAR CYCLES
The 8.5-year cycle is the two-phase pattern of the 17-year cycle. It has an orb of 1.5 years and 
last bottomed with the 17-year cycle in May 2019. It is next due to bottom between 2026 and 2029, 
so we are entering the orb of this cycle this year. Right now, I favor a more bullish tone for Soy-
beans in 2026, but with ever-present bearish fundamental headwinds (Brazil’s production capacity) 
and a president who does not seem able to make nice with the world’s largest importer of Soybeans 
(China), I cannot rule out the possibility that Soybeans could break lower into an 8.5-year low even 
this year. Again, an early indication that a more bearish picture is developing would be a monthly 
close below the uptrend line depicted on the monthly Soybean chart.

## Page 177

173
The 5.5-year cycle is the three-phase pattern of the 17-year cycle. Like the 8.5-year cycle, it also 
has an orb of 1.5 years, which is somewhat long for a cycle of this length. I believe this is due to the 
fact that this 5.5-year cycle can also appear as the two-phase pattern of the 8.5-year cycle. When this 
happens, these cycles tend to form at the shorter end of the expected cycle length. The 5.5-year cycle 
last bottomed with the 17-year cycle in May 2019. It was next due to bottom in January 2025 +/– 18 
months, and last year’s Forecast 2025 book highlighted why the August 2024 low of 936.25 was 
probably it. Since that low, Soybeans have not done much to convincingly confirm this bias; how-
ever, some positive technical signals are beginning to emerge at the time of this writing in November.
Should August 2024 fully verify as a 5.5-year low, a likely price target for a crest is 1361.00 +/– 
100.00. Soybeans could easily reach this target in 2026 if any hint of hot and dry weather emerges 
during either the Brazil or U.S. growing seasons. 
THE 34-MONTH CYCLE
The 34-month cycle is the backbone of the Soybean market. There are usually two 34-month 
cycles in a 5.5-year cycle and three 34-month cycles in an 8.5-year cycle. The 34-month cycle carries 
a 9-month orb and last bottomed in August 2024. This would have been the second 34-month cycle 
measured off the May 2019 low, which is why it was probably a 5.5-year cycle low as well. The 
glaring problem here is the lack of upside follow-through that Soybeans have experienced since bot-
toming in August 2024. The choppy trading range that has developed may be signaling that this third 
34-month cycle is destined to become bearish by falling below 936.50. Should that happen, it would 
signal that Soybeans are almost assuredly falling to an 8.5-year low instead. As you can see, 2026 is 
shaping up to be a pivotal year in determining the intermediate trend for this market.
Regardless of whether this current 34-month cycle resolves bullishly or bearishly, further upside 
in Soybean prices is likely in 2026 before possibly topping out. Supporting this thesis is the fact that 
the smallest gains of 34-month cycles—excluding those that occurred just before a 17-year low—
were 26%. A 26% increase off the 936.50 low would be 1260.00. It is interesting that this is right at 
the bottom of the price range given for a possible 5.5-year crest. Unless this market is far more bear-
ish than I think it is, we will use 1260.00 as a comfortable price target in 2026.

## Page 178

174
The 34-month cycles break down into two phases of 17 months or three phases of 11 months. 
Due to the choppy, range-bound trade over the last year, identifying the breakdown of this 34-month 
cycle is proving difficult. The best fit at the moment is that the low of August 6, 2025, marked an 
11-month cycle low. It formed 12 months after the August 2024 low, so it was right on time. This 
implies that this 34-month cycle is breaking down as a three-phase pattern with the next 11-month 
cycle low due between May and September 2026. However, we could still see a 17-month cycle low 
transpire between October 2025 and April 2026. I particularly like the idea of seeing a sharp decline 
into the spring of 2026, right before the U.S. planting/growing season is set to begin.
GEOCOSMICS
As with Corn and Wheat, there are two major geocosmic signatures taking place in 2026 that 
could influence the Soybean market. The first is the Saturn–Neptune conjunction occurring on Febru-
ary 20, 2026. Recall from the section on weather that both Saturn–Neptune conjunctions and opposi-
tions have coincided with peaks in grain markets. Since 1950, there have been two conjunctions and 
two oppositions. In these previous instances, Soybeans formed a 17-year crest during the first three 
and an 8.5-year crest during the last one, all within 13 months or less of the exact aspect. Measuring 
from February 2026, 13 months takes us to March 2027.
The second major aspect for Soybeans is Jupiter forming a waxing trine to Saturn. In the previous 
three instances of this multi-pass aspect going back to 1966, Soybeans have formed significant highs (and 
one low) during the central time band of this aspect or within three months of the first or last passage. 
These include the 8.5-year high and low of July and December 2008, the 17-year high in June 1988, and 
the 5.5-year high in July 1966. The central time band of the coming Jupiter–Saturn waxing trine is August 
2026–July 2027. Also, keep in mind that this aspect is occurring with both planets located in fire signs. 
In addition to the above signatures, Soybeans also seem to respond to Jupiter in a waxing trine 
to Neptune. This aspect will be exact on July 20, 2026. While not all turns around this aspect have 
coincided with long-term cycle tops or bottoms, they have often been retests of major highs and/or 
lows before the new primary trend reasserts itself. What is notable is that these secondary tops and 
bottoms generally occur within four weeks of the exact aspect, with one occurrence taking place eight 
weeks later. This makes June 20–August 20 a potential time to look for a reversal in Soybeans.
Finally, Ceres transiting the signs of Gemini and Cancer is a planet/sign combination that has 
been strongly correlated with crests in the grain markets. For those who are unfamiliar, Ceres is a 
dwarf planet that was the goddess of agriculture, grain, and the harvest in Roman mythology. Look-
ing back to 1966, Soybeans have formed at least a 34-month cycle top—or a high that was followed 
by at least a 20% decline—more than 70% of the time when Ceres was between 4° Gemini and 27° 
Cancer. Ceres enters Gemini in May 2026 and will not exit the sign of Cancer until May 2027 due to 
its retrograde motion.
CONCLUSION
Soybeans showed the most relative strength of all the grains during 2025 and have now broken 
above a year-long trading range as we near the end of 2025. This is somewhat of a conundrum, 
considering that China has imported a paltry number of U.S. Soybeans during the 2025 marketing 
campaign due to trade tensions and high tariffs. At the time of this writing, there is talk of a deal that 
would require China to purchase 12 MMT during the final few months of 2025, but whether that hap-
pens remains to be seen.

## Page 179

175
Nonetheless, we have to respect the price action, and it is signaling that Soybeans may want to 
move higher in 2026. This could be the market getting out in front of a significant trade deal, or perhaps 
the geocosmic picture is simply indicating that it is time for this market to rally. In any event, clearing 
1140.00 on a monthly closing basis would give Soybeans a very good shot at hitting 1260.00 +/– 20.00 
in 2026. However, should dry weather develop during the Brazilian growing season (usually October 
into March of the following year) or the U.S. growing season (typically May–September), 1361.00 +/– 
100.00 is not out of line. It should be noted that while this is a forecast for 2026, it will include portions 
of both the 2026 and 2027 growing seasons for Brazil. Should Soybeans fall below the uptrend line 
mentioned earlier and/or below 936.25, these upside targets would become obsolete, with Soybeans 
likely heading down to test the 17-year low of 791.00 instead. That is not my bias, but it is a possibility 
considering the less-than-friendly trade dynamics between China and the United States.
My preferred time band for a possible crest in 2026 is September 15–November 25. This may 
also be a double top or a retest of an August high, as there will be a large collection of Venus aspects 
taking place August 10–21. However, a crest at this time may prove to be the first 34-month cycle 
high before a healthy correction and then a continued rally into early 2027, when the geocosmics 
say we could see a multi-year top develop by March. And remember, this will be at the heart of yet 
another Brazilian growing season, as mentioned above. 
THREE–STAR CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR GRAINS 2026
The following is a list of three-star geocosmic critical reversal dates (CRDs) used in MMA’s 
market-timing calculations for grains. You may also include the CRDs given for the stock market, as 
others not listed here may appear there. Allow a three-day orb for a cycle to culminate during these 
periods. The CRDs are mostly valid when a market is in the time band for a primary, half-primary, or 
major cycle crest or trough. Look to buy cycle lows that may unfold or sell crests if prices rally into 
these CRD zones.

 FAVORABLE TIMES, CHALLENGING TIMES FOR 2026
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia
The following is a list of “Favorable Times” and “Challenging Times” for planning in 2026. The 
favorable times indicate favorable periods to schedule important meetings, social gatherings (such as 
parties and weddings), or any event you want to proceed smoothly and harmoniously. The challeng-
ing times are just the opposite: tensions and stress tend to be higher than normal, and you may find 
it best to avoid scheduling social events and important meetings during these periods. All dates are 
based on Eastern Time (ET). This means the beginning and ending dates may be one day later in the 
Far East.

*Indicates that this period overlaps with Mercury retrograde. If on the “Favorable” side, it is fine for a 
party, but if on the “Challenging” side, it is probably not for a commitment, agreement, or sale. 
**Indicates this period overlaps with Venus retrograde. If on the “Challenging” side, be careful of 
cosmetic surgery or purchasing expensive goods. 
Of course, not every day in a “Favorable Times” period will necessarily be good, nor will every 
day in the “Challenging Times” period necessarily be bad. For help in choosing specific dates for an 
important event, please consult a professional astrologer.
In 2026, two solar eclipses will occur: February 17 at 2849°’ Aquarius (North Node Eclipse) and 
August 12 at 2002°’ Leo (South Node Eclipse). There will also be two lunar eclipses: March 3 (12° 
Virgo 53’) and August 28 (4° Pisces 54’). In my experience, a North Node Eclipse tends to be more 
favorable than a South Node one. Furthermore, it is not wise to plan a major event such as a wed-
ding or to open a new business during the two weeks between a lunar and solar eclipse, or vice versa, 
which may also coincide with an otherwise “favorable time,” as shown above.

 MERCURY RETROGRADE PERIODS IN 2026
There will be three Mercury retrograde periods between February 26 and November 13, 2026. 
They are: February 26–March 20 (2233°’ Pisces to 829°’ Pisces); June 29–July 23 (2615°’ Cancer to 
1618°’ Cancer); and October 24–November 13 (2058°’ Scorpio to 502°’ Scorpio).
During 2025, Mercury retrograde occurred in the fire signs of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. This 
created an atmosphere of exuberance, impulsiveness, and overconfidence that was mirrored in world 
affairs and the financial markets. Fire retrogrades are quick to spark bold proclamations and rash 
decisions, often with outsized consequences. A striking example came in April 2025, when President 
Trump’s sudden declaration of “Liberation Day” rattled markets around the world. That announce-
ment, made without the tempering of detail or diplomacy, sent shockwaves through global exchanges 
and highlighted how Mercury retrograde in fire can encourage impulsive statements with dramatic 
market repercussions. On June 13, we also witnessed Israel’s surprise attack on Iran, commencing the 
Twelve-Day War between the two nations. Mercury was not retrograde at that time, but it occurred 
in the year when the Trickster was retrograde in fire signs, thus highlighting the fiery nature of deci-
sions in 2025.
In 2026, the retrogrades move into the water signs of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, bringing an 
entirely different tone. Water retrogrades emphasize emotion, empathy, and sensitivity, shifting the 
focus away from impulsive confidence toward a more reactive and subjective climate. The world is 
already deeply embroiled in conflict on multiple fronts, and the prevalence of social media ensures 
that images of suffering and human cost reach global audiences instantly and relentlessly. Against 
this backdrop, Mercury retrograde in water signs will encourage leaders, institutions, and populations 
to view global events through an emotional lens, often appealing to sympathy, compassion, and even 
guilt. A more melancholic undertone is therefore likely to accompany this period.
With retrogrades in water signs, all communication also comes under the influence of the rulers 
of these signs: the Moon, Neptune, and Pluto. The Moon will shape discourse with sentimentality and 
national pride, stirring populations with messages that evoke nostalgia, a sense of belonging, and a 
longing for security. Neptune brings ambiguity, fog, naïveté, and the risk of outright deception; com-
munications under its influence may be poetic or idealistic but often lack clarity or concrete detail, 
leaving room for confusion and misinterpretation. Pluto adds intensity, secrecy, and power struggles. 
Under its shadow, words may carry hidden agendas, veiled threats, or attempts at manipulation. 
Taken together, this suggests that communications from world leaders during 2026 may be emotion-
ally charged, deliberately ambiguous, and, in some cases, deceptive or obscuring of truth.
The shift will be most visible in negotiations and geopolitics. In place of fiery, declarative rheto-
ric, discussions are more likely to be framed as pleas for understanding, emotional appeals, and 
heightened sensitivities. This introduces fragility into diplomacy. Talks may stall or unravel not 
because of the substance of the proposals but because of perceived slights, mistrust, or emotional 
overreactions. Nations directly involved in warfare or humanitarian crises will find their narratives 
amplified, with sympathetic responses flowing more quickly, but also with polarization increasing 
when emotions cloud rational compromise. Leaders who thrive on emotional rhetoric may gain trac-
tion in this climate, but they also risk backlash if sentiment is not supported by practical solutions.

## Page 182

178
Financial markets will not be immune to these shifts. In 2025, exuberance and speculative 
confidence, buoyed by Mercury’s retrogrades in fire signs, pushed many indices to fresh all-time 
highs. In 2026, however, the mood is likely to be more melancholic, with sentiment overtaking 
logic. Investors and traders may find themselves swayed less by data and fundamentals and more 
by images and narratives circulating in real time. Emotional overreactions will become more com-
mon, creating sharp swings in prices and fragile confidence. This is a dangerous environment for 
markets, since volatility will not necessarily be rooted in measurable risk but rather in the shifting 
tides of collective sentiment.
The transition from fire to water in Mercury retrograde marks a shift from impulsive bravado to 
emotional vulnerability. Where 2025 rewarded boldness and risk-taking, 2026 is more likely to pun-
ish those who ignore the emotional weight of words and images. In this climate, calls for empathy, 
charity, and sacrifice will grow louder, yet the potential for overreaction, mistrust, and deception will 
also intensify. Mercury retrograde in water signs does not resolve conflict, but it does reframe how 
the world experiences and reacts to it. Leaders and markets alike will be tested on their ability to 
navigate this heightened sensitivity without losing sight of clarity, rational judgment, and truth.
Writers and speakers will find their words steeped in emotion, memory, and subjectivity. Lan-
guage will be colored by Neptune’s ambiguity and poetic allure, the Moon’s sentiment and national 
pride, and Pluto’s intensity and undercurrents of secrecy or transformation. This atmosphere favors 
storytelling that is nostalgic, compassionate, and deeply reflective, and it may draw individuals back 
to old or forgotten projects that now beckon to be completed or reimagined. It also opens the door to 
more artistic and imaginative expressions, with creativity flowing in symbolic, intuitive, and often 
dreamlike forms. At the same time, there is a heightened risk of ambiguity, manipulation, and emo-
tional excess that is likely to further polarize humanity through social media platforms. Audiences 
will respond more viscerally, making words feel heavier and more consequential. The best commu-
nicators will be those who can authentically channel this emotional tide, giving voice to vulnerability 
and unspoken truths without losing clarity or integrity.
In financial markets, Mercury retrograde is known as the “Trickster” because, during this cycle, 
support and resistance levels are often broken—only to reverse right back again. These are “fake 
out” periods, marked by more than the usual number of false buy and sell signals. This coincides 
with contradictory political and economic data and announcements that can lead to sudden whipsaws 
in financial markets. For this reason, our motto under Mercury retrograde is to “take profits sooner 
rather than later.” If not, your profits could suddenly vanish before reaching your price or time target. 
A quick, modest profit is better than a loss during these periods. Mercury retrograde can still favor 
aggressive short-term trading over intervals of perhaps one to four days. Also, any market that does 
not complete a market cycle within four days of Mercury retrograde is likely to do so within two days 
of the midpoint of the retrograde cycle (when the Sun conjoins Mercury). This can be a useful leading 
market-timing indicator.
Mercury retrograde periods are notorious for bringing confusion, delays, and disruptions to the 
flow of everyday affairs. It is wise to exercise caution when signing contracts, finalizing agreements, 
or making binding commitments, as details are more easily overlooked and people may change their 
minds. In business, one often sees a spike in missed appointments, schedule changes, and outright 
cancellations. Technology and communication systems are also vulnerable—phones, computers, and 
networks seem to “go on the blink” more often, and misunderstandings in emails or phone calls 

## Page 183

179
become more common. The general advice is to be precise in communication, double-check instruc-
tions, and repeat back critical details to confirm mutual understanding. Avoid debates or confronta-
tions surrounding sensitive topics during this period. In 2026, individuals born under water signs, 
or those with Mercury retrograde in water signs, should be especially mindful, as they may be more 
receptive to these retrograde periods—particularly when Mercury retrograde passes through their 
Sun sign.
Yet Mercury retrograde is not purely negative. These cycles offer rare opportunities for review, 
reflection, and recalibration. They are excellent times to go back over old work, revise and edit writ-
ing, return to unfinished projects, or revisit past conversations and negotiations with a fresh perspec-
tive. I find this to be a great time for research. Lost or forgotten information often resurfaces, and old 
contacts may reappear, allowing for closure, reconciliation, or renewed collaboration. For creative 
people, retrogrades can bring bursts of insight by forcing the mind to approach problems from new 
angles. In some cases, delays and cancellations create the space to pause, reflect, and avoid mistakes 
that might otherwise result from rushing forward.
Used consciously, Mercury retrograde is a time to slow down, reflect, and realign. It is less 
suited to launching new ventures or charging ahead and more supportive of tying up loose ends, 
correcting errors, or unearthing hidden insights. By respecting its rhythm, people can transform what 
is often seen as a disruptive period into one that strengthens clarity, creativity, and preparedness for 
the forward motion that follows.

 VENUS RETROGRADE PERIOD IN 2026
There will be one Venus retrograde period in effect in 2026, from October 3 to November 13, 
2026. Venus will begin its retrograde motion at 829°’ Scorpio and move back to 2251°’ Libra on 
November 13, before returning to direct motion. The dance of Venus through the signs of Scorpio 
and Libra will have the greatest impact on individuals with strong placements in these signs, as well 
as on those with Venus retrograde in their natal charts. It is also worth noting that Venus retrogrades 
occur in nearly the same sign and degree every eight years. 
Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, traditionally rules harmony, attraction, wealth, and the 
arts, bringing balance and drawing people and nations into accord. In mundane astrology, she also 
shapes the tone of diplomacy, treaties, and alliances, while in finance, she governs currencies, bank-
ing, prosperity, and the appetite for luxury. When Venus turns retrograde, however, these themes 
become unsettled: alliances strain, markets question value, currencies wobble, and societies reassess 
what they truly cherish. It is a time when appearances fade, trust is tested, and both nations and indi-
viduals are called to re-evaluate what is worth keeping and what must be released.
Whenever a planet is retrograde, the time is generally not favorable for initiating activities in the 
areas that planet rules. Therefore, October 3 to November 13 is not conducive to significant changes 
in appearance, relationships, or the purchase of goods or services intended to enhance one’s image. 
Major changes in hairstyle, cosmetic surgery (including procedures on the face or other areas meant 
to improve attractiveness), breast or lip implants, and liposuction are NOT generally advised during 
this time. 
Furthermore, one is advised against making important purchases for home or office furnishings 
or undertaking major renovations in one’s home, office, or building without first taking the time to 
make sure the same products or services are available elsewhere at a lower cost. With Venus retro-
grade in Scorpio, one might be prone to overleveraging with debt, but it may be wise to do a little 
homework before taking on debt or a leveraged position during this time. 
Venus retrograde is a time when lovers from the past may re-emerge, as a sense of nostalgia about 
previous relationships comes into one’s consciousness. However, these may not work out in the long 
run, so it is best to simply enjoy them for what they are and reminisce about the good times in the past 
without weaving complex webs regarding a future together.
What Venus retrograde is excellent for, however, is reflection and re-evaluation. Old lovers or 
friends may resurface, giving a chance for closure or reconciliation. People often find themselves 
reassessing what—and who—they truly value. In finances, it is a fruitful time to review spending 
habits, renegotiate agreements, or reconsider investments. In creative and artistic pursuits, it can 
bring a revisiting of old projects or a reimagining of past inspirations. We saw an echo of this reflec-
tive quality in April 2025, when President Trump’s sudden “Liberation Day” announcement, in which 
he was reassessing the U.S. economic relationship with “friends and foes,” sent markets into turmoil. 
The declaration carried the dramatic, impulsive fire-sign tone of that year’s Mercury and Venus ret-
rogrades in Aries, forcing investors and nations alike to pause, reconsider the true value of assets, 
and reassess the relationships and alliances underpinning financial and geopolitical stability. In this 
way, Venus retrogrades often serve less as moments of dramatic outward change and more as turning 

## Page 185

181
points of reassessment, where both personal and collective values are tested and redefined. Notably, 
significant lows formed in most markets as Venus and Mercury stationed direct. 
In financial markets, Venus retrograde periods often coincide with a difficult and unpredictable 
monetary or fiscal environment. It is not unusual to see central banks or government leadership make 
major policy changes, from accommodative to tightening, or vice versa. Thus, trends prior to the 
retrograde will frequently reverse during this time. With Scorpio ruling over debt and Venus ruling 
money, it should come as no surprise to find that significant cyclical reversals tend to take place dur-
ing this signature. 
The last time Venus was retrograde in Scorpio–Libra was October 5–November 16, 2018. The 
18-year trough in U.S. T-Notes and U.K. 10-year Gilts formed on October 8 and 10, 2018, respec-
tively. Currencies are also affected, most noteworthy being Bitcoin’s four-year trough, which formed 
on December 15, 2018, a month after Venus went direct (but within its shadow). Even in the prior 
Venus retrograde that commenced October 8, 2010, Bitcoin fell 83%, from $0.06 on October 7 to 
$0.01 on October 8 (another four-year cycle trough, and the last time it would see that valuation!). 
Bitcoin was back up 800% to $0.09 by October 11, 2010. These patterns are worth noting, as the four-
year cycle window for Bitcoin will be in effect again during 2026.
In terms of stock markets, Venus retrograde and direct stations are two of the most consistent 
correlations to primary and greater cycles in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, using an orb of 12 
trading days. Within 12 trading days, the Venus retrograde station period has an 80% correlation with 
primary or greater cycles. The Venus direct station has a 75% correlation with primary or greater 
cycles within ten trading days.1 Perhaps the most noteworthy of the Venus retrograde cycles in Scor-
pio was the October 10, 2002, station, which coincided with the NASDAQ bottom on October 8, 
2002—a long-term trough marking the aftermath of the dot-com collapse, during which the index 
had fallen by 78%.
Looking back across the last eight Venus retrograde cycles in Scorpio-Libra (1962-2018), a 
repeating pattern emerges that reveals how the traditional energy of Venus weakens, particularly 
while in Scorpio, its traditional sign of detriment, allowing more Martian themes of conflict, scan-
dal, and upheaval to dominate. Instead of harmony, beauty, and diplomacy, these periods have been 
marked by revelations and crises—whether in the form of scandal, such as WikiLeaks (2010), the 
Iran-Contra affair (1986), or the heightened #MeToo revelations (2018); outbreaks of political 
violence and murder, from the Bali bombings (2002) to the killing of prominent journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi in the Saudi embassy, and the mail bomb scares (2018); or broader confrontations such as 
the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962).
One of the most consistent themes that re-emerges during these retrogrades is conflict and/or 
peace negotiations involving Israel. In 1962, global anxieties were heightened by Cold War tensions. 
Still, in subsequent cycles—1978, 1986, 1994, 2002, 2010, and again in 2018—we repeatedly see 
Israel at the forefront of world news, whether in the form of violent escalations or peace talks. We 
have seen glimpses of light, such as the Egypt-Israel peace talks (1978) and the Israel-Jordan peace 
treaty (1994). We have even had Nobel Peace Prizes awarded to Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and 
Yasser Arafat, during the Venus retrograde cycle of 1994. However, all the cycles also include an 
intensification of violence. The recurrence of these events leads me to conclude that the current unrest 
in the Middle East is likely to continue into 2026, and at best, peace talks may take place during this 

## Page 186

182
retrograde. Ironically, this is not a good time for peace talks, as Venus is debilitated with low essential 
(Venus in Scorpio) and accidental (Venus retrograde) dignity.
Another striking theme is the prominence of crude oil and the energy sector. In 1978, the Iranian 
Revolution redirected global attention to oil supplies, sending prices soaring; in 2010, BP’s settle-
ment over the Deepwater Horizon disaster reshaped conversations about corporate accountability and 
environmental costs; and in 2018, the French Yellow Vest protests, initially sparked by rising fuel 
prices, evolved into a national crisis. Each of these Venus retrograde periods highlights how oil, as 
both a resource and a symbol of wealth and power, sits at the very heart of Venusian concerns about 
value and exchange—but under Scorpio’s influence, it manifests through upheaval, scarcity, and 
confrontation.
The final pattern to note is the occurrence of natural disasters, especially hurricanes, typhoons, 
and cyclones, in regions of the world most prone to them. These range from Hurricane Michael in 
Florida (2018), Super Typhoon Yutu (2018), Storm Callum causing flooding in the U.K. (2018), 
severe flooding in Pakistan (2010), Hurricane Kenna (2002), deadly flooding in Morocco (2002), 
severe flooding in southeastern Texas (1994), Hurricane Kendra (1978), severe flooding in Arizona 
and New Mexico (1978), Typhoon Kate (1970), to the Columbus Day Storm (1962). Given that 
Scorpio and its ruler Pluto also rule over destruction and volcanic activity, it is worth noting that the 
following related events also took place during prior Venus retrogrades in Scorpio: the deadly wild-
fire that destroyed Paradise in California (2018), major eruptions of Mount Merapi along with the 
Mentawai earthquake and tsunami (2010), and earthquakes in West Papua and Alaska (2002). 
The analysis of prior cycles reveals that when Venus is retrograde, its opponent, Mars, takes the 
lead, highlighting themes of conflict, destruction, exposed secrets and scandals, market wobbles, and 
the reopening of old wounds, whether in the Middle East or in intimate relationships.
On a final note, pay particular attention to the period ending the Venus retrograde on November 
13, 2026 (with an orb of one week), as we have several important geocosmic events taking place 
simultaneously. The final Mercury retrograde of 2026 will also end on the same day. I highlight this 
because both planets ended their retrogrades within a week of one another in early April 2025, which 
marked a significant low for many assets.

 SPECIFIC TIMES OF THE YEAR BY SEASONS IN 2026
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
In the ancient world, astrologers often relied on the seasonal ingress charts—moments when 
the Sun entered the cardinal signs—as powerful tools for forecasting. In ancient Persia, these days 
were not only seen as moments of celestial importance but were also regarded as sacred days 
infused with special energy. Astrologers would calculate the exact moment of the ingress, and 
people were encouraged to use this time for prayer and visualization of personal growth and a bet-
ter world. The spring ingress, for instance, was celebrated as Nowruz, the New Year—a tradition 
that continues to this day. Even now, many astrologers view the spring ingress as a symbolic “birth 
chart” for the year ahead.
Interestingly, echoes of this ancient practice survive in modern culture, woven into our holidays 
and festivals. Christmas, aligned with the winter solstice, celebrates the coming of the “Son of God,” 
as the astrological “Sun of God” is reborn out of the year’s darkest night. Easter, near the spring equi-
nox, celebrates resurrection and new life with the symbolic egg. The summer solstice has likewise 
been marked by celebrations of light, fertility, and abundance through ancient European traditions 
such as Midsummer or St. John’s Day. Halloween, just after the autumn equinox, aligns with the 
Sun’s passage through Scorpio, the sign of death and rebirth.
Ancient cultures marked these turning points of the year not only because of their practical rela-
tionship with the Sun, the Earth, and the onset of the seasons but also because of the profound impact 
these shifts had on human life and survival. Astrologers, however, took the moment further, using the 
ingress as a celestial “snapshot” of the heavens at the precise moment of transition and interpreting it 
as an imprint of the energies destined to shape the months ahead. The chart itself changes depending 
on one’s location on Earth, which is why, traditionally, the ingress chart cast for the ruling capital of 
the world was given special weight. After all, the decisions made at the seat of power carry the great-
est repercussions across the world.
In this section of the book, we analyze the 2026 seasonal ingress charts for Washington, D.C. 
We then examine the major planetary aspects that occur throughout each season. This provides a col-
lective psychological overview of what is happening in the United States and the world. From there, 
we deduce certain themes that may be highlighted in the political, economic, financial, and mundane 
realms. We then apply this ancient art to speculate on possible events or decisions that may relate 
to these highlighted themes. This year, we will also include the astrocartography chart to see which 
regions of the world are most likely to be activated during each period. We will also mention the 
national charts and the charts of global leaders that may be activated under important transits to help 
us speculate on which nations and leaders are likely to fall under the cosmic spotlight.
Let’s begin with the winter solstice of December 21, 2025, which outlines the cosmic themes for 
the following three months.

THE CAPRICORN INGRESS (WINTER SOLSTICE)
The winter solstice for Washington, D.C., occurs on December 21, 2025, at 10:02 AM EST. 
The Sun (leader of the nation) is in the eleventh house of friends, alliances, hope, and prosperity. 
It forms a hard, separating square aspect to Saturn (lord, or ruler, of both the first and twelfth houses) 
and Neptune (lord of the second house of finances), which are in conjunction on the cusp of the sec-
ond house. The Sun in the eleventh house suggests that the White House will be focused on alliances, 
party politics, lawmaking, and working closely with Congress and legislators. In the international 
arena, it is likely to be working closely with allies, building on ties and common interests. 
Saturn as lord of the first house represents the government or nation bound to economic issues 
(cusp of second house). Saturn tends to bring about restrictions, austerity, or a debt burden. Since 
it is also lord (ruler) of the twelfth house, Saturn could introduce a theme of hidden loss, sabotage, 
systemic decay, or waste. Together, these factors could represent the U.S. national debt burden. The 
second house can also represent the Federal Reserve, and the heavy presence of Saturn could indicate 
restrictions or pressure being placed on it by the government. Neptune in conjunction with Saturn 
further emphasizes the notion of manipulation, coercion, waste, inflation, and confusion, especially 
around the topic of finances and the economy, as Neptune is also lord of the second house. Neptune’s 
involvement blurs clarity, pointing to illusory wealth, deficits, or financial scandals. This energy can 
result in systemic decay or a drain on resources, which, in economic terms, can lead to inflation, a 
weakening U.S. dollar, or both. This could create the illusion of assets rallying to new all-time highs, 
accompanied by a false sense of hope (Sun in the eleventh house) that masks deeper structural decay 
while spurring speculation in high-risk assets.

The square from the Sun is indicative of friction and conflict between the aims of the president 
and those of the Federal Reserve Board (Neptune) and members of Congress (Saturn). Since the 
square is separating, it may indicate that the confrontation has already peaked just before the ingress, 
but its aftereffects linger into the first quarter. Symbolically, there will likely be a political struggle 
rooted in the financial markets or monetary policy, and an erosion of trust and confidence in financial 
governance. On the public level, there may be frustration with Congress and legislators (the eleventh 
house) or with the president (Sun in the eleventh), who is unable to act effectively due to financial 
constraints (Saturn–Neptune in the second).
The Ascendant in Aquarius suggests an undertone of reform, radical shifts, perhaps even upheaval, 
with an emphasis on doing things differently and breaking from established traditions. With Aquarius 
rising, the United States may appear contrarian, isolated, or disruptive in world affairs, driven by a 
strong focus on and investment in technology. 
The co-rulers of Aquarius are Saturn and Uranus. With Saturn on the cusp of the second house 
and conjunct Neptune, we have already noted that the key issues will center on the economy and 
the management of the nation’s resources and treasury. The Saturn–Neptune conjunction could also 
indicate the materialization of dreams related to technological goals that the president is pursuing to 
give the nation a leading advantage.
Yet the position of Uranus is equally important, as it lies within orb of the fourth-house cusp, 
also known as the Imum Coeli (IC). Uranus on the IC adds a destabilizing undertone to the domestic 
foundation—upheaval in the homeland, volatility in housing, land, or infrastructure, and a restless 
public demanding change. The Moon, another indicator of the public mood, is poorly positioned in 
Capricorn (the sign of its detriment) and in the twelfth house. This further indicates public dissatisfac-
tion, isolation, and a sense of powerlessness. The Moon, opposed by an exalted Jupiter in the sixth 
house, suggests the public’s dissatisfaction with a powerful institution that is supposed to be serving 
them. The nation may grow increasingly unsettled, driven by several factors. Uranus is at 28° Taurus 
and the IC at 1° Gemini, suggesting these events will take place later in the quarter. Therefore, the 
disruptive factors, while not an exhaustive list, may include the financial markets, natural disasters, 
farming or food supply, trade, or cyberattacks. With Uranus in the final degrees of the third house of 
trade and Mercury (the planet of trade) prominently placed in the tenth house—but in its detriment in 
Sagittarius—issues concerning trade deals are likely to remain prominent. 
In astrometeorology, Uranus is associated with high-pressure systems that bring cold air from the 
upper atmosphere or the Arctic Circle. Its location on the IC suggests strong and unusually cold winds 
hitting the East Coast from the north. The region is likely to experience below-normal precipitation 
and perhaps an Arctic outbreak bringing extreme cold, dry air, and biting winds. It is worth noting 
that the Saturn–Neptune conjunction brings together two slow-moving, low-pressure planets. The 
conjunction of these two planets may result in extreme weather patterns related to precipitation, with 
moisture concentrated in certain areas prone to flooding, while other regions experience drought.
On the geopolitical stage, Aquarius rising gives the United States a disruptive, contrarian 
stance—more likely to break with allies, redraw alliances, or pursue unorthodox strategies. Fiscal 
strain (Saturn–Neptune in the second) could weaken America’s leverage in international finance, 
while internal instability may reduce its ability to project power abroad. Uranus on the IC also raises 
the risk of natural disasters or environmental shocks—earthquakes, severe storms, or infrastructure 

## Page 191

187
breakdowns—events that could not only destabilize the homeland but also reverberate through global 
markets and alliances.
Looking at the astrocartography map, we see regions of the world where the Sun on the angles 
is brought to the foreground. The winter Sun (flanked by Venus and Mars) will be on the Midheaven 
(MC) over Greenland and Brazil, and on the IC of Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and Australia as the 
Capricorn ingress takes place. The ascendant will be over the U.S. West Coast and extend into central 
Canada, while the descendant will be over Western Europe, northeastern Africa, and the Red Sea.
The most important outer planetary configuration will be the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, which 
is on the MC over the Middle East, the Red Sea, and Russia (Moscow). It is worth noting that the Sun 
and Mars will also be on the descendant over the Red Sea and Yemen.
At the time of the winter ingress, transiting Saturn is at 25° Pisces and transiting Neptune at 
28° Pisces. It is worth noting that 25° Pisces is a sensitive degree for both Ukraine and Russia, as 
each nation has its natal Chiron at 25°–26° Pisces at important junctures in its history. For Russia, 
Chiron was at this degree during the storming of the Winter Palace on November 7, 1917. Ukraine 
proclaimed its independence from both Bolshevik Russia and German influence several months later, 
on January 22, 1918, with Chiron at 26° Pisces. Ukraine again proclaimed its independence from the 
USSR on August 24, 1991, and in this chart Mars is in opposition at 25° Virgo. 
Chiron relates to the collective wound—an identity trauma, humiliation, loss, or an area where 
the nation feels perpetually vulnerable. Saturn represents authority, control, restriction, and karmic 
lessons. Therefore, the transit of Saturn over a nation’s natal Chiron is likely to force the nation to 
confront old wounds of historical trauma, humiliation, or unresolved identity crises. Saturn’s restric-
tive pressure can manifest as international isolation, sanctions, or blockages that remind the nation of 
painful vulnerabilities. The people may face austerity, shortages, harsh authority, or structural limita-
tions. In opposition to Ukraine’s natal Mars, this transit reinforces aggressive military conflict, set-
backs, and logistical exhaustion. Ukraine may experience frustrated aggression, with its armed forces 
bogged down. Of course, we will not see the same explosive manifestation every 30 years as Saturn 
transits Pisces; what makes this transit distinctive is its conjunction with Neptune, which adds a cloud 
of confusion, idealism, propaganda, deception, disorganization, and disillusionment to the mix. 
The Saturn–Neptune conjunction will be exact at 0° Aries 45′ on February 20, 2026. Zero degrees 
Aries is the most sensitive point in the entire zodiac when it comes to global affairs. Events tied to this 
degree are more likely to resonate on the collective stage, affecting nations, leaders, and international 
relations. Transits to this point are frequently associated with geopolitical turning points, wars, and 
the emergence of new world orders.
Looking at the natal charts of world leaders, the most powerful activation related to the Sat-
urn–Neptune conjunction appears to be that of Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister of Japan. He has 
his natal Moon at 1° Aries, in opposition to his natal Jupiter at 1° Libra. This heavy conjunction on 
his natal Moon represents a personal and political burden of collective sacrifice, as he embodies 
the weight of a dissolving or restructuring moment in Japan. This signature suggests pressure from 
public discontent, uncertainty, or disillusionment regarding leadership. At the time of writing this 
report (September 2025), it comes as no surprise to find that Ishiba has just handed in his resignation 
due to public disapproval stemming from lingering scandals, distrust, and economic strain resulting 
from inflation, which is likely to worsen following the U.S.–Japan tariff agreement. He resigned days

before a powerful solar eclipse on his natal Jupiter, in opposition to the Saturn–Neptune conjunction 
to his natal Moon.
King Salman of Saudi Arabia was born under a Saturn–Neptune opposition, and his son, Moham-
med bin Salman, has Neptune at 0° Capricorn (exactly square the transiting Saturn–Neptune con-
junction). As this signature activates both their charts, one might wonder whether the prince will 
be crowned king during this conjunction. Another leader whose natal chart will be activated by this 
signature is Emmanuel Macron of France; his natal Sun–Mercury conjunction is at 29° Sagittarius, 
in opposition to his natal Jupiter at 1° Cancer. The Saturn–Neptune conjunction will form a T-square 
to all these planets. As a leader, Macron will stand out during this period. His authority (Sun), diplo-
macy (Mercury), and alliances (Jupiter) will be challenged and may come under pressure.
The following leaders were also born around the time of a Saturn–Neptune conjunction, and this 
signature is likely to reactivate the natal promise within their charts: Xi Jinping (China), Vladimir 
Putin (Russia), Jerome Powell (chair of the Federal Reserve Board), and Cyril Ramaphosa (South 
Africa). Pedro Sánchez (Spain) and Andrzej Duda (Poland) were born under the Saturn–Neptune 
opposition, while Keir Starmer (UK) was born under the Saturn–Neptune square. 
In traditional astrology, the Aries nations are Iran, Palestine, England, Denmark, Germany, 
and Syria. With the initial ingress of Saturn and Neptune into Aries taking place in 2025, we have 
seen the Assad regime fall in Syria, the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, and the world’s attention 
turn to the atrocities occurring in Palestine. On the day of the solar eclipse in opposition to the Sat-
urn–Neptune conjunction (September 21, 2025), we witnessed a significant pivot and new beginning 
by Western nations, starting with the announcement by Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, of 
the UK’s formal recognition of the Palestinian state. This was followed by similar announcements 
from many Western nations ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting that took place the next day. 
While the Saturn–Neptune conjunction will affect the entire world, the Aries nations are likely to find 
themselves on the front pages during this period.
SPECIFIC PERIODS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE WINTER
The most important geocosmic event of the winter will be the triple conjunction of the Sun, 
Venus, and Mars, taking place in close proximity from January 6 to 9. On January 18, Mercury and 
the Moon will also join the stellium in the final degrees of Capricorn and early Aquarius.
Venus is the planet of diplomacy, peace, values, treaties, and the arts. Opposing these energies, 
Mars is the planet of war, aggression, conflict, assertion, and action. Their conjunction often signifies 
an alliance formed under pressure or the eruption of social passions that have reached a boiling point. It 
initiates a synodic cycle in which collective desires (Venus) and drive (Mars) interact. The previous two 
occurrences of this synodic cycle were strongly marked by the Russia–Ukraine war. The Russian inva-
sion took place on February 24, 2022, just days after the Venus–Mars conjunction of February 16, 2022, 
in the sign of Capricorn (Russia is considered a Capricorn nation). Capricorn emphasizes systems, 
governments, structure, and authority. Mars thrives under the discipline of Capricorn and is exalted in 
this sign; as such, a powerful Mars tends to overwhelm Venus here. The Venus–Mars conjunction in 
Capricorn is therefore suggestive of conflict over state power, military structures, and global order. 
The next Venus–Mars conjunction took place on February 22, 2024, in early Aquarius, within 
orb of Pluto. This period was marked by an intensification of the Russian offensive following the 

## Page 193

189
loss of Avdiivka, which was seen as a major gain for Russia. Aquarius rules collective ideals, revolu-
tions, technology, and social movements. The Venus–Mars conjunction in Aquarius coincided with 
new forms of alliance, ideological clashes, and technology-driven conflicts such as cyberwarfare, AI 
geopolitics, and digital currencies. In February 2024, the war in Ukraine remained central but was 
increasingly framed in terms of international coalitions, sanctions, and drone or tech warfare. 
As we head into 2026, the prospect of peace seems increasingly remote. Another Venus–Mars 
conjunction will occur in a similar sector of the zodiac, leading us to believe that we will either see an 
intensification of the war or a reversal signature leading to peace. Under the shadow of the Saturn–
Neptune conjunction over the world axis, my bias is toward the former. Therefore, we are likely to 
see a further escalation of warfare in Ukraine during this period. This is supported by the symbolism 
of the Sun, Venus, and Mars forming a conjunction with the explosive and purging energy of Pluto 
from January 19 to 27.
On February 3, Uranus will station direct at 27° Taurus, near the malefic fixed star Algol, mark-
ing a potent turning point in global affairs. Uranus stations signal sudden shifts and awakenings, 
and Taurus governs material security, resources, and societal stability. With Algol’s influence, the 
potential for shocking, disruptive, or violent events is amplified—literal or symbolic “decapitations” 
of leadership, institutions, or systems are possible.
Historical patterns at this degree underscore themes of sudden escalations in war and conflict, 
revolutionary uprisings, and abrupt shifts in power (e.g., the intensification of World War II in 1940–
42 and the Indian Rebellion of 1857). Even technological and social domains may be affected, as 
Uranus tends to bring unforeseen breakthroughs or disruptions.
By February 5, Saturn will reach an exact opposition to the September 21, 2025, eclipse degree 
of 29° Virgo 05′. This eclipse stands out, as it formed within a one-degree orb of 0° Libra, which 
is one of the “World Points,” (0° of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn). These points are pivotal 
in mundane astrology because they lie on the cardinal cross, marking the turning points of the sea-
sons and symbolizing new cycles of collective action. When eclipses or major transits activate these 
points, events tend to spill into the public sphere, influencing nations, governments, and global sen-
timent. They act as portals between private and collective experience, where individual or national 
developments gain worldwide visibility and impact. 
The eclipse potential tends to be triggered or released as the malefic planets (Mars or Saturn) 
transit this degree or form a hard aspect to it. Mars will form the first hard aspect on December 14, 
2025, shortly before its ingress into Capricorn. However, as this is a square aspect, we would expect 
the Saturn opposition to have greater impact. Note that Saturn’s orbit is much slower, and that an orb 
of 2° can be applied. 
In practice, activations of the Aries “World Point” often coincide with political realignments, 
leadership changes, social movements, and historical turning points—moments when the energy of 
renewal and initiation (Aries) manifests tangibly in world affairs.
One of the most important aspects of the year occurs on February 20, as the single passage of 
the Saturn–Neptune conjunction takes place. Refer to the earlier chapter on this aspect for a detailed 
analysis. 

## Page 194

Mercury retrograde will commence on February 26, followed quickly by the disruptive Mars–
Uranus square on February 27. These are potent signatures for market reversals. Mercury’s retro-
grade will bring closure to the quarter, ending with the spring ingress on March 20.
Critical reversal dates for winter: The following are geocosmic critical reversal dates for financial 
markets during this season. Any market making a two-week or greater high or low can be considered a 
candidate for a reversal within +/− three trading days. The steepness of the reversal depends on where 
each market is in its primary cycle. If it is within the time band for its primary-cycle crest or trough, the 
reversal will be steepest. If it is due for its one-third or half-cycle phase, the reversal will be less steep.

THE ARIES INGRESS (SPRING EQUINOX)
The spring (vernal) equinox for Washington, D.C., occurs on March 20, 2026, at 10:45 AM EDT.
Once again, the Sun (symbolizing the leader of the nation) is in the eleventh house of allies and 
friends, only this time it is head-to-head with the theme of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction. In fact, 
there is a stellium of planets in Aries, as the ingress occurs within orb of a New Moon, further empha-
sizing the theme of new beginnings. The luminaries are accompanied by Neptune, Saturn, Venus, and 
Chiron in Aries.
The ascendant is in Gemini, suggesting that the next three months will be defined by quick 
changes, information wars, communication, and the “spin” of narratives. Public life and the nation 

## Page 195

191
will be shaped by media, diplomacy, and the management—or mismanagement—of information, as 
Mercury in Pisces is in its fall and detriment.
Mercury, the ruler of the chart, is prominently placed in the tenth house. This suggests that the 
nation’s identity is firmly bound to the executive and the public reputation of President Trump, who 
seeks visibility and decisive action. Mercury’s placement, however, suggests that miscalculations and 
miscommunications are likely, increasing the risk of escalation abroad and scandals at home. Such 
escalations may even be used as a tactic to divert attention from those scandals—a classic Mercurial 
display of showmanship. 
Mercury is conjunct the North Node and applying to a conjunction with Mars (lord of the sixth 
house—the military). This configuration indicates an agitated leadership, prone to aggressive or rash 
decisions, confrontational diplomacy, and the initiation or threat of military action. The presence of 
the North Node suggests that this will be a highly fated and pivotal quarter for the United States. 
Taken together, these factors point to an ambitious but risky push by President Trump, involving 
executive actions that define the nation’s image. On the positive side, this could relate to technologi-
cal investments in AI initiated by the White House; on the negative side, it could manifest as involve-
ment in geopolitical conflict.

Figure 20: Astrocartography map from Solar Fire
The Winter 2025 Ingress Chart signaled financial issues related to trade, deficits, inflation, and 
structural weakness, as well as a president embroiled in internal conflict. These same themes are 
clearly spilling into the spring 2026 ingress chart as the Saturn–Neptune conjunction joins the Sun in 
Aries in the eleventh house. President Trump is thrust into congressional battles and tensions with the 
Federal Reserve on the domestic front, and into confrontation with traditional allies on the interna-
tional front, as he asserts dominance despite institutional weakness and financial decay eating away 
at the foundation. By the time of this ingress, Trump is entering his second year in office. Historically, 
this is the period when presidents face their steepest challenges—marked by waning political capital, 
increased pushback from Congress, and midterm primaries heating up. It is also the period most often 
accompanied by external crises testing foreign policy (about 80% of major U.S. foreign conflicts 
have historically begun within the first two years of a presidential term).
The Sun is exalted in Aries, suggesting that Trump will be highly active, energized, and intent on 
asserting dominance in both domestic and foreign arenas. Yet the conjunction with Saturn (lord of the 
eighth, ninth, and tenth houses), in its fall, and Neptune (lord of the eleventh), suggests legislative strug-
gles, loss of credibility, backroom dealings, erosion of alliances, and deception. The exalted Sun indicates 
that Trump will push his policies through regardless, but at the cost of destabilizing (Neptune) institutions 
(Saturn). The eleventh house could also point to alliances that Trump has developed with leaders in the 
tech world—ranging from Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Jensen Huang to Mark Zucker-
berg—or to new alliances on the global stage with the heads of the Gulf States, such as Emir Sheikh 
Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani (Qatar), Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (Saudi Arabia), and Presi-
dent Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (U.A.E.). It may even point to issues within the Republican Party.
With the Moon in Aries, the public mood will be impatient, impulsive, frustrated, confrontational, 
and outspoken. The Moon is trapped between Venus and Chiron. Being within orb of a conjunction 
with Venus is usually favorable; however, in Aries, Venus is weak and in its detriment. As a result, 
there will be weak social cohesion, polarization, more aggressive values, and an inward-looking,

self-oriented society. This spells trouble for the rest of the world, as it suggests struggles with diplo-
macy and friction with alliances on the international front. The Moon is also applying to a conjunction 
with Chiron in Aries, representing the collective wound around identity, independence, militarism, 
or leadership. Taken together, this indicates a wave of public discontent or protest, injury to national 
morale, and strained foreign relations.
Therefore, the spring 2026 ingress chart indicates a volatile quarter in Trump’s second year. 
The exalted Sun empowers him to act boldly and visibly, but weakened Saturn, Mercury, and Venus 
suggest that his initiatives will be marred by institutional decay, miscommunication, and diplomatic 
friction. The public is restless, Congress is fractured, and alliances are strained by financial demands 
and hidden entanglements.
In the markets, illusions may give way to strain: debt, deficits, and currency instability feature 
prominently in the U.S. economy, with trade disputes flaring. Geopolitically, covert or sudden shocks 
to U.S. leadership are possible (Uranus in the twelfth house), while foreign entanglements (military 
or ideological) risk escalation.
This is a quarter of bold moves but dangerous overreach—when appearances of strength mask 
underlying fragility, and sudden disruptions (whether political, financial, or natural) could redefine 
the trajectory of Trump’s presidency and America’s global role.
Looking at the astrocartography map, the Sun, Saturn, and Neptune are all in conjunction on the 
Midheaven (MC) over Greenland and Brazil, and on the IC over Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and 
Australia. This is the same location held by the Sun during the previous Capricorn ingress, as well as 
by Saturn and Neptune when their conjunction becomes exact on February 20, 2026. The ascendant 
lies over the Pacific Ocean, while the descendant runs through Russia, Iran, the Persian Gulf (Strait 
of Hormuz), and the Gulf States. 
SPECIFIC PERIODS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SPRING
There is quite a cosmic shift in collective attitude and behavior at the very start of the season, 
as the luminaries and Mars translate the energy of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, while Uranus 
makes its final ingress into Gemini. March 20–25 should mark the onset of this shift, with Mercury 
stationing direct on the same day as the solar ingress. As the Sun forms a conjunction with Neptune 
(March 22) and Saturn (March 25), it acts as a trigger, manifesting the energy of the Saturn–Neptune 
conjunction. We are anticipating important geopolitical and market events during this period.
As the Sun leaves Aries for Taurus, another eventful period unfolds April 13–25. Mars and 
Mercury will jointly trigger the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, while Venus conjoins Uranus as both 
ingress into Gemini. We would anticipate aggressive communication and announcements, assertive 
actions around conflict, and sudden changes or disruptions to alliances, trade, and the markets. 
May will be relatively calm as the world readjusts to the shocks of late March and April. However, 
this will be short-lived, as the Sun forms its annual conjunction with Uranus while Venus squares 
Saturn May 22–28. When Uranus is activated, we tend to see sudden shifts or unexpected challenges. 
Such periods frequently coincide with public protests, rebellion, or even natural disasters. 
The most auspicious signature of the quarter—and possibly even of the year—will occur on June 
9, when Venus forms a conjunction with Jupiter. As these two benefic planets meet in the sky, this

194
period tends to bring a surge in public morale and optimism, fueled by economic growth, recovery, 
and expansion, as well as positive developments in diplomacy and the strengthening of alliances. It is 
a time when prosperity, cooperation, and goodwill are emphasized, creating favorable conditions for 
both national and social advancement.
Critical reversal dates for spring: The following are geocosmic critical reversal dates for finan-
cial markets during this season. Any market making a two-week or greater high or low can be con-
sidered a candidate for a reversal within +/− three trading days. The steepness of the reversal depends 
on where each market is in its primary cycle. If it is within the time band for its primary cycle crest or 
trough, the reversal will be steepest. If it is due for its one-third or half-cycle phase, the reversal will 
be less steep. If none of these apply, the reversal is probably not worth trading.

THE CANCER INGRESS (SUMMER SOLSTICE) 
The summer solstice takes place in Washington, D.C., on June 21, 2026, at 4:24 AM EDT. 
The themes from the spring ingress find an echo in the summer ingress, as this chart also has a 
Gemini Ascendant. Perhaps this is apt, as President Trump is a Gemini native and will clearly dominate 
both domestic and global affairs. As such, the president will embody how the rest of the world views the 
United States. The national identity will be shaped by messaging, media (including social media) spin, 
executive orders, the AI race, technological dominance, trade wars, diplomacy, and duality. The struggle 
with eleventh-house issues (alliances, friendships, Congress, and the Republican Party) is also evident 
in this chart, with the Sun (Trump) in another hard aspect to Neptune (lord of the eleventh house and 
positioned there as well). While the Sun forms hard aspects to Neptune in all the ingress charts of 2026 
and into 2027, it is interesting that the eleventh house keeps getting highlighted.

The lord of the chart is Mercury, about to form a conjunction with Jupiter in Cancer in the third house. 
The focus of the third house aligns with that of Mercury—namely, communication, media, trade, treaties, 
transportation, neighboring nations, domestic mobility, and education. Exalted Jupiter will strengthen 
Mercury and suggests that this will be a period filled with grandeur, optimism, expansion, and national 
pride. This aligns well with the 250th anniversary of the United States of America on July 4, 2026, which 
is being referred to as the America250 celebrations. Yet Jupiter’s largesse runs the risk of inflated prom-
ises or exaggerated rhetoric as well. With Venus in Leo, and also in the third house, the July celebrations 
promise entertainment, spectacle, celebrity, and cultural expressions that will be broadcast worldwide. 
This is likely to be a summer of celebrations, festivals, public events, and media saturation.
The Sun is in the final degrees of the first house, suggesting that President Trump will be highly 
visible, taking center stage and shaping the nation’s identity. His focus is shifting toward the econ-
omy, markets, and national wealth. The Sun squares Neptune (lord of the eleventh house), indicating 
struggles with alliances, both domestic and foreign, and a degree of confusion or deception. The 
American public (Moon) forms a T-square to this aspect, reflecting tension between the public mood 
and the president. People may feel misrepresented or manipulated, sensing a disconnect between 
spectacle and reality. This placement could also signal public pushback on issues related to youth 
(Moon in the fifth house), education, or health care (Moon in Virgo).
Just above the horizon, Mars is applying to a conjunction with Uranus in the final degrees of the 
twelfth house and within orb of the ascendant. This is a troubling signature, suggestive of hidden 
enemies, sudden crises, disruptive attacks, sabotage, or cyberwarfare. Mars, as lord of the twelfth 
house, is indicative of hidden enemies and clandestine activities intended to cause mischief. Uranus, 
as lord of the tenth house, points to sudden shocks to the leadership or the president. This configura-
tion could manifest as an assassination attempt, terrorist incident, health scare, military miscalcula-
tion, or intelligence crisis. It symbolizes a destabilizing shock undermining the national leader late in 
the summer of 2026. 
The Mars–Uranus conjunction is at 3° Gemini, which is within orb of a conjunction to the natal 
Moon (6° Gemini) of Ukraine (1918 chart), so this event may have repercussions for the Ukrainian 
people. With regard to global leaders, this conjunction is also within orb of a conjunction to the natal 
Moon of Vladimir Putin (2° Gemini) and the natal Mars of Ursula von der Leyen (president of the 
European Commission). It is also within orb of a hard aspect to planets in the natal charts of several 
European leaders, including Macron, Meloni, Starmer, Sánchez, and Duda. 
The Moon in Putin’s chart symbolizes the people, the homeland, emotional instincts, and public 
mood. With the Mars–Uranus conjunction on his natal Moon, we could see sudden unrest or volatility 
among the Russian people—possibly protests, strikes, or a rapid change in public sentiment. There 
is also the potential for an emotional or instinctive overreaction by Putin, leading to impulsive deci-
sions. The Moon also rules personal security and health, so it could signal instability in his personal 
life or well-being. For Ursula von der Leyen, this signature may activate her fighting spirit, prompt-
ing a sudden assertion of leadership or radical, unexpected decisions in defense or military policy. 
This could manifest as EU military coordination, sanctions, or swift, bold action, possibly in response 
to Russia or external shocks.
In astrometeorology, Uranus and other high-pressure planets are suggestive of dry climates. The 
Mars conjunction will bring the extreme heat conducive to drought during an abnormally hot summer.

The summer solstice ingress paints a quarter of patriotic spectacle, media saturation, and eco-
nomic promises—centered on America250 and dominated by President Trump, who ties leadership 
to prosperity and national pride. But beneath the fanfare, Congress and alliances remain unstable, 
finances are fragile, and the public senses disillusionment. The most dangerous signature is the Mars–
Uranus conjunction in the twelfth house near the ascendant, which could manifest as sudden disrup-
tion from hidden enemies, intelligence leaks, or foreign sabotage, threatening the leadership’s image. 
It could also signal a natural disaster disrupting the summer’s patriotic mood.
The ingress chart spells trouble for the markets, as it shows Venus (markets) separating from an 
opposition to Pluto (disruptions). In the summer of 2026, there are two important geocosmic signatures 
pertaining to the markets: Jupiter will oppose Pluto (July 20), shortly after its ingress into Leo, and the 
North Node will enter Aquarius (August 18). Historically, the U.S. equity markets tend to experience a 
long-term correction when Jupiter is in Leo and the North Node transits Aquarius or Capricorn. While 
both signatures will remain in place through 2027, their activations occur in the summer, ushered in 
by the Pluto opposition. It is worth noting that the dot-com bubble burst in the year 2000 as Jupiter in 
Gemini (technology, communication, and the internet) formed an opposition to Pluto in Sagittarius (the 
World Wide Web). This time, Pluto is in Aquarius, a sign closely associated with advanced technology. 
Is there a bubble forming in artificial (Uranus) intelligence (Gemini)? The transit of Uranus through 
Gemini supports this outlook, as a boom–bust cycle is expected in this field.
With the Jupiter opposition to Pluto, tension arises between expansion, optimism, and growth 
(Jupiter) and power, control, sudden change, and hidden forces (Pluto). Historically, this aspect cor-
relates with financial excesses, speculative bubbles, ideological clashes, and the exposure of corrup-
tion, as well as struggles between elites and broader society. In the markets, it often brings turbulence, 
extreme swings, and episodes of overreach followed by correction. Overall, this signature implies 
increased volatility and dramatic societal or economic shifts.
The Jupiter–Pluto opposition (on July 20 at 4° Leo–Aquarius) will come to the forefront as it 
is translated by the Sun–Moon opposition (Full Moon) of July 29 +/− 3 days. Between July and 
November, we are going to see a number of important signatures take place in the fire sign of Leo. 
On August 12, a Solar Eclipse will form at 20° Leo. On October 3, Mars will oppose Pluto from 3° 
Leo, and on November 3, Mars will trigger and reactivate the eclipse degree of 20° Leo.
These Leo signatures are likely to activate the natal charts of the following world leaders and 
bring them—and, by extension, their countries—into the spotlight: Xi Jinping (China), Vladimir 
Putin (Russia), Volodymyr Zelensky (Ukraine), Donald Trump (United States), and Mohammed bin 
Salman (Saudi Arabia). 
Looking at the astrocartography map, the Sun will be on the Midheaven (MC) over Russia, Iran, 
and the Persian Gulf, and on the IC over Canada (narrowly missing the U.S. West Coast). The ascen-
dant will also fall over Canada, while the descendant runs through Australia and Papua New Guinea. 
The most important outer planetary configuration will be the Jupiter–Pluto opposition, with Pluto 
on the MC over the United States and on the IC through China. Could this be a crest in the NASDAQ?
SPECIFIC PERIODS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SUMMER
Summer starts out with the Sun square Neptune, June 21–25. The Cancer ingress will bring a 
sudden shift in the global mood, accompanied by confusion and disorientation. It will be quickly 

## Page 202

198
followed by Mercury turning retrograde as Jupiter enters Leo, June 29–30. With Jupiter in Leo, the 
public mood may lift as we approach the America250 celebrations, which will dominate the media.
July 4–7 will be an intense period, marked by powerful geocosmic signatures: Mars conjunct 
Uranus, followed closely by Mars trine Pluto and Neptune turning retrograde. Mars forming aspects 
to Uranus and Pluto are aggressive, explosive signatures that can be unsettling. This period may be 
dominated by shock and sudden events, and the markets will be susceptible to sudden reversals.
We then enter a period dominated by outer planetary aspects going exact back-to-back from July 15 
to 29. It will start with the Uranus–Neptune sextile, followed by the Uranus–Pluto trine, Jupiter–Pluto 
opposition, Jupiter–Neptune trine, Jupiter–Uranus sextile, and finally the Neptune–Pluto sextile. Toward 
the end of this two-week period, Mercury stations direct on July 23, and there is a powerful Full Moon 
that could act as a trigger for all these aspects on July 29. After February’s Saturn–Neptune conjunction, 
this is likely to be the next most significant period of the year. We would expect to see major reversals in 
the financial markets and significant decisions made regarding global affairs during this time.
We will then move toward a Solar Eclipse on August 12. Since eclipses mark important beginnings 
and endings, it is possible that this marks a key date for the expression of the outer planetary activity 
from the final two weeks of July and may, in fact, have a wide two-week orb—from the Full Moon 
of July 29 until the Lunar Eclipse of August 28. The Solar Eclipse takes place at 20° Leo, with a path 
extending from Western Europe to North America. It is no surprise that the sign of Leo is prominent in 
the natal charts of many global leaders. Leo is on the ascendant in President Trump’s chart and on the 
Midheaven of Putin’s chart; President Xi Jinping’s natal Moon is in Leo; Zelensky’s IC and natal Moon 
are in Leo; and Taiwan’s Lai Ching-te has his natal Uranus at 19° Leo. The eclipse degree will be trig-
gered by transiting Mars on November 3, 2026, which could mark the release of this eclipse’s energy. 
Nations likely to be impacted by this eclipse include France, India, Pakistan, and Bahrain.
By August 18, the North Node enters Aquarius and will spend 18 months transiting this sign. It 
is worth noting that this is the signature that Louise McWhirter identified as the basis of her theory: 
“The major or primary trend of business volume and finance is clearly pointed out by the nineteen-
year cycle of the North Node as it passes through the twelve signs of the zodiac… When the North 
Node enters Aquarius, the low point of business activity has been reached.” (McWhirter, 2008, p. 5)1 
Given that transiting Jupiter is also in Leo for approximately 12 months from June 2026, we have two 
signals suggesting that the stock markets are likely to bottom during this period.
We enter a tense period, susceptible to major shocks and disruptions, August 28–September 1. 
This window incorporates the Lunar Eclipse, Sun square Uranus, Mars square Saturn, and the first of 
three exact Jupiter–Saturn trines. The Jupiter–Saturn trine is important to the markets, as this signa-
ture has a high correlation with troughs in the world reserve currency that underpins all markets—the 
U.S. Dollar. The trines will be exact on August 31, 2026; April 3, 2027; and July 11, 2027. We expect 
the trough in the U.S. Dollar to form roughly in the middle, around December 2026 +/− 1.5 months. 
The last time we had this signature was in May 2008, when the U.S. Dollar formed a trough in March 
2008. A loss of confidence in the U.S. Dollar is usually accompanied by panic in the financial mar-
kets. Therefore, this is the third important signature pointing toward trouble as we enter late 2026.
The Sun–Uranus and Mars–Saturn squares are disruptive signatures that suggest a period of high 
tension. We may see public protests or aggressive acts. Be on the lookout for abrupt headlines, mili-
tary flashpoints, market volatility, or natural disasters and extreme weather patterns. This period is 

## Page 203

199
likely to extend through the Uranus station retrograde on September 10. September 2026 is packed 
with important geocosmic signatures, holding the potential to be one of the most significant months 
of the year—before an action-packed fourth quarter.
Critical reversal dates for summer: The following are geocosmic critical reversal dates for 
financial markets during this season. Any market making a two-week or greater high or low can be 
considered a candidate for a reversal within +/− three trading days. The steepness of the reversal 
depends on where each market is in its primary cycle. If it is within the time band for its primary 
cycle crest or trough, the reversal will be steepest. If it is due for its one-third or half-cycle phase, 
the reversal will be less steep. If none of the above apply, the reversal is probably not worth trading.

THE LIBRA INGRESS (AUTUMNAL EQUINOX) 
The autumnal equinox in Washington, D.C., occurs on September 22, 2026, at 8:05 PM EDT.
This is a chart symbolic of crisis and filled with heavy, volatile, and karmic geocosmic signatures. It 
signals a quarter of reckoning, confrontation, and exposure following a year of illusions and spectacle.
The chart has Aries on the ascendant, suggesting a volatile, martial, and assertive national 
temperament. The collective mood is combative, impatient, and ready for confrontation. With the 

## Page 204

200
ascendant near the end of the sign (26° Aries), we are approaching the culmination of an Aries cycle, 
suggestive of crisis or consequences from actions taken earlier in the year. The late degree further 
hints at exhaustion or battle weariness, as the nation enters the quarter already embroiled in issues 
that can no longer be deferred. Aries rising also places the people and leadership at the forefront. This 
is an active ingress, so events are likely to erupt rather than unfold gradually.
Mars, as ruler of the chart, is positioned in its fall at 26° Cancer, in exact square aspect to the 
ascendant from the fourth house. This depleted Mars is emotional, defensive, reactionary, and unsta-
ble. In its fall, its strength is compromised; it becomes reactive and erratic. The nation is suffering 
from some type of injury or attack and is responding—and likely overreacting—with emotion (anger) 
rather than decisive strategy. This placement could signify the misuse of power or retaliatory actions 
by leadership. Perhaps it speaks of internal divisions (Mars in Cancer) weakening the outward projec-
tion of strength (ascendant in Aries).
