The Jupiter Sign Correlation
Jupiter will transit the sign of Leo from June 30, 2026, through July 26, 2027. A filtered wave of 
DJIA prices over the past 100+ years shows this to be a planet-sign combination with a strong ten-
dency for significant lows. Sometimes these declines last into the next sign of Virgo before the final 
low is completed.
The Lunar North Node Stock Market Cycle 
The transits of the Moon’s North Node through the signs also show a correlation to long-term cycle 
crests and troughs in the DJIA. Long-term cycle lows happen most frequently when the Moon’s North 
Node transits between 1° Aries and 10° Sagittarius. This will be in effect from December 2024 to October 
2030. However, these studies also show the greatest concentration of lows was when the Moon’s North 
Node transited between 18° Pisces and 29° Capricorn. This condition will be present from August 2025 
to April 2028. Note that this overlaps with our projection of the next 18-year cycle (2027–2029).
November 2026 through April 2027 stands out because Jupiter will be in Leo, in opposition to the 
Lunar North Node in Aquarius. Both correlate to long-term cycle lows in the DJIA. The hard opposition 
between these two might time this low, or at least a significant leg down to the final 18-year cycle low. 
Figure 16: Moon’s Nodes through the signs and their correspondence to the U.S. stock market. Long-
term cycle lows in the U.S. stock market happen mostly between 1° Aries and 10° Sagittarius, with the 
greatest concentration between 18° Pisces and 29° Capricorn (shown in the shaded area marked “low”).

THE U.S. POLITICAL CYCLE
The possibility of new all-time highs in 2025–2026, followed by a very sharp decline into 2027–
2029, is also shown by the correlation of stock market crashes to the party in office, as described in 
the last two years’ Forecast books. 
In the past 120 years, all but one major stock market “crash” has happened under a Republican 
president. And the one that happened under a Democratic presidency in 1966 was the least severe of 
all (26.5%). At the same time, all-time highs were achieved under every Republican president since 
1900. However, that has not been the case under three Democratic presidents.
This study suggests that there will be both a new all-time high and a stock market “crash,” 
defined as a loss of 29% or greater before January 2029. A Republican has been elected as of Novem-
ber 5, 2024, and his term will (presumably) last until January 2029.
 The stock market has already fulfilled the first part of this correlation as it is making a new all-
time high. Now we see if it will fulfill the latter part of this study with a decline of at least 29% before 
January 2029.

Table: “R” represents Republican. “D” represents Democrat. * indicates the only decline less 
than 29%, and the only decline shown here that occurred during a Democrat presidency. 
It may be argued that the 50% decline of 1938 also happened under a Democrat president 
(Franklin Roosevelt). However, this was not the “crash” related to that time. It was a second-
ary correction to the crash of 1929–1933 that occurred under Republican Herbert Hoover. 
There was no new all–time high prior to the decline of 1938.
STOCK SECTORS
Jupiter is in Cancer from June 9, 2025, through June 30, 2026. This will highlight real estate, 
home building, remodeling, weddings, domestic appliances, furniture, restaurants, foods, agricultural 
products, dairy, water supplies, hotels and resorts, and businesses that cater to family activities and 
family planning. Strangely enough, the real estate market began struggling shortly after this transit 
began. It looks like it topped out with Jupiter in early Cancer, and it may bottom in 2027–2028 along 
with the stock market. Jupiter enters Leo from June 30, 2026, through July 26, 2027. This redirects 
attention to companies that cater to parties, social activities, huge events, sports, gambling, risk-
taking, and children.

Saturn tends to depress stocks and coincides with cyclical lows in the sectors ruling the sign it 
is in. Saturn is in Pisces from September 1, 2025, to February 14, 2026. But then it finally settles in 
Aries from February 14, 2026, through April 2028. The sign of Aries implies price pressure or lack 
of supplies in the field of military equipment and weapons, defense, sports, athletic equipment and 
apparel, guns, and ammunition. 
However, the ingress of Uranus into Gemini is likely to have a more profound effect on the stock 
market. It entered Gemini first on July 7, 2025. And after a brief return to Taurus, from November 
8, 2025 through April 26, 2026, Uranus will fully re-enter Gemini through August 3, 2032. This is 
a boom-bust period for all sectors related to Gemini. That is, these sectors will often enter a boom 
period for at least 2–5 years during which prices explode to new all-time highs, often appreciating 
4-fold or more from their lows of 2025–2026. After that, they lose about 75–90% of their value by 
the time Uranus enters the next sign. Sectors most prone to this boom-bust cycle in the next six years 
include computers, technology, artificial intelligence, automobiles (electric and driverless), airplanes, 
space exploration, drones, quantum computing, and media companies. It is quite possible that the 
tech-heavy NASDAQ will outperform the DJIA, even with the former being bullish during much of 
this period while the latter is bearish. These are the fields to look for the best investment possibilities, 
but they are also the areas in which bankruptcies are more prone to occur prior to 2032, much like the 
dot-com bubble of 2000–2002. 
CONCLUSIONS
Last year’s book concluded, “Our studies suggest that the stock market is rising to the crest 
of its three-year cycle, ideally due November 2024–July 2025. The ideal price range for this 
crest is approximately 44,000–51,000.” The three-year cycle in the DJIA topped out on Decem-
ber 5, 2024, at 45,059 with a double top of 45,054 on January 31, 2025. Last year’s conclusion 
went on to state, “Once the 3-year cycle crest is completed, a sharp decline (greater than 10%) 
is expected to end by November 2025. Traders and investors are advised to buy that decline in 
anticipation of yet another rally to test or exceed the highs that happened before the decline to 
the 3-year cycle trough.” That also happened with the 3-year cycle low of April 7, in which the 
DJIA fell to 36,611, a drop of 18.74%. It then soared to a new all-time high as this is being writ-
ten, currently challenging 50,000.
For 2026, our forecast calls for the crest of the 18-year cycle to take place at 49,400–57,750, with 
special attention in the zone of 51,609–52,342. This could be achieved prior to the completion of the 
first 50-week cycle, due within 16 weeks of March 27, or within the 2–5 months that follow this low. 
That second high (crest of the second 50-week cycle) could be a double top to the first high, and if so, 
it sets the stage for the beginning of a 37–63% decline due 2028 +/- 1 year. Thus, traders are advised 
to buy the first 50-week cycle trough due within 16 weeks of March 27, 2026, but then look to sell 
the crest of the second 50-week cycle due 2–5 months afterwards. 
THREE-STAR CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR DJIA IN 2026
Last year’s CRDs correctly identified 12 of the 13 reversal dates listed. The following is a list of 
three-star geocosmic critical reversal dates (CRDs). They are most valid when a market is also in the 
time band for a primary, half-primary, or major cycle crest or trough, but may also apply to secondary 
highs or lows that are tradeable. Allow a range of three trading days.

 THE NASDAQ IN 2026
by Wiebke Held, MMA Analyst
INTRODUCTION
This year, MMA is pleased to provide a yearly outlook on the NASDAQ Composite by MMTA 
Director and MMA Analyst Wiebke Held. Many of the longer-term cycles will match well with those 
of the DJIA, although their actual completions will often be slightly apart from one another in weeks 
or even months.
REVIEW AND PREVIEW
The NASDAQ Composite Index started the year with a retest on January 24, 2025, of the all-time 
high that was printed on December 16, 2024. This all-time high of 20,205 was the 3-year cycle crest 
that formed after a remarkable 100% gain following the lows that formed in October 2022, which 
was the 6-year cycle trough. The retest of the all-time highs occurred again (triple top) on February 
18, which then marked the start of a quick and steep decline into the expected 3-year cycle trough, 
which formed on April 7, 2025, at 14,784. The 3-year cycle trough was followed by an equally steep 
and quick rally with only shallow pullbacks. As expected in the first phases of new cycles, they are 
extremely bullish. And as of this writing, the NASDAQ is still making new highs.
In 2026, we are now reaching the time band for the first 50-week cycle trough within the new 
3-year cycle, which will likely be followed by another rally into the crest of the second 50-week 
phase of the 3-year cycle. But traders and investors must be on the lookout, as this current 3-year 
cycle is the last phase of the current 6- and 9-year cycles, and those are the last phase of the current 
18-year cycle.
With long-term cycles being in their last phase, and intermediate-term cycles entering their sec-
ond phase in 2026, the likelihood of the 18-year crest forming in 2026 is high, which would be the 
start of the decline into the 18-year cycle trough.
For both the long- and intermediate-term cycles analysis, the NASDAQ Composite Index (Ticker: 
IXIC) is used, since this index provides the most historical data available. In the following sections, 
I will refer to the NASDAQ Composite Index as the “NASDAQ.”

The 18-Year Cycle
Since the NASDAQ started trading in 1971, there have been three prominent lows in 1974, 1990, 
and 2009 that suggest an 18-year cycle is present in the NASDAQ. Measured across 100% of the 
instances of the 18-year cycle, its normal length is 17.3 years with an orb of 17 months. Measured 
from its start in March 2009, the NASDAQ will be entering its 17th year of the 18-year cycle in early 
2026. The 18-year cycle trough is due 2024–2027. So as of 2026, we are now in the third year of the 
time band for the 18-year cycle trough. 
There are 3 lows and 2 completed cycles of the 18-year cycle in the history of the NASDAQ so 
far. The past data suggest that the NASDAQ is following the same long-term cycle rhythm as the 
Dow Jones and S&P500 indices. Thus, we use the March 2009 low as the 18-year cycle low even 
though the low in 2002 was lower.
Historically, the 18-year cycle has rallied from its starting low to its crest for 161 months on aver-
age, with a range of 113–180 months before the crest forms. Since March 2009, the NASDAQ has 
rallied for 198 months and is still making new all-time highs as of this writing in November 2025. 
This is the longest period of increase in its history. The appreciation from trough to crest has histori-
cally been 788–1489%, with an average gain of 1139%. The appreciation from the low in March 2009 
until late October 2025 has been over 1680%, again the largest appreciation in its history. Being well 
into the time band for the 18-year cycle trough and seeing an extension beyond the historical bound-
aries of time, going up and appreciation, led me to conclude that the 18-year cycle crest is imminent.
Declines from the crest to the trough have historically lasted 13–108 months with an average of 
61 months. The decline into the 18-year cycle from 1974 to 1990 lasted 13 months, and the decline 

## Page 114

110
into the 18-year cycle from 1990 to 2009 lasted 103 months. If we count the months from the last 
18-year cycle crest in March 2000 to the low in October 2002, the decline lasted 30 months, before a 
double bottom in 2009 stretched this period longer. Hence, one could argue that a more normal length 
of decline into an 18-year cycle trough lasts from 13 to 30 months. The depreciation from the crest to 
the trough has ranged from 34%–75% with an average decline of 55%. 
The current 18-year cycle is breaking down into a combination pattern with lows at the 1/3 
(6-year cycle) and 1/2 marks (9-year cycle). Let’s explore the phases of the 18-year cycle next to 
refine this market timing projection.
The 9-Year Cycle
In the history of the NASDAQ, there are 5 completed instances of the 9-year cycle, which is the 
half-cycle to the 18-year cycle. The 9-year cycle has a mean periodicity of 9.5 years and a normal 
length of 8–11 years. The last 9-year cycle trough happened in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pan-
demic hit, and slightly expanded to 11 years and 1 month. Measured from the March 2020 low, the 
current 9-year cycle is in its 6th year. The next 9-year cycle trough is due between January 2028 and 
April 2031. One may notice that this time band does not overlap with the 18-year cycle time band. 
We at MMA know that cycles tend to balance out over time. Hence, I expect the current 9-year cycle 
to be on the shorter side in length or even contract (6–8 years), as the first 9-year cycle was slightly 
on the longer side and thus expanded somewhat.
The current 9-year cycle is breaking down into a 3-phase pattern with 3-year cycle lows (range 
26–36 months) in October 2022 and April 2025. We are now in the third 3-year cycle which is the 
final phase of the current 9-year cycle, when the low of the 9-year cycle would normally be due. 
Since 1971, all but one 9-year cycle exhibited a right translation, meaning the crest formed 
past the mid-point of the cycle, which is a bullish trend characteristic. Historically, bullish 9-year 
cycles have peaked between 79–132 months with an average of 98 months. As of this writing in 
November 2025, the current 9-year cycle has been going up for 68 months from its start in March 
2020. The appreciation of bullish 9-year cycles has been between 207%–642% with an average of 
421%. Based on this study, the price target for the current 9-year cycle crest is 34,700 with a range 
of 20,500–49,400. The current 9-year cycle has appreciated over 260% so far and is well within 
that range.
The historical range of decline from the crest to trough in bullish 9-year cycles has been 1–15 
months, with an average of 8 months. The historical depreciation in all cases has seen a range of 
29%–75% with an average of 40%. Since we are in the third and final 3-year cycle phase of two 
9-year cycles within the greater 18-year cycle, the next 9-year cycle trough will also be the 18-year 
cycle trough. Thus, we anticipate a 29–75% decline once the crest is in.
The 6-Year Cycle
In the history of the NASDAQ, 8 completed instances of the 6-year cycle can be observed at the 
1/3 intervals of the greater 18-year cycle. The 6-year cycle has a mean periodicity of 5.5 years and a 
normal length of 4–7 years. The last 6-year cycle trough culminated in October 2022. Measured from 
this low, the current 6-year cycle is in its 3rd year. This is the third and final 6-year cycle within the 
current 18-year cycle. 

## Page 115

111
The current 6-year cycle is exhibiting a breakdown into a 2-phase pattern (3-year cycle low in 
April 2025) with bullish characteristics (higher highs and higher lows).
Since 1971, all 6-year cycles exhibited a bullish right translation pattern. Historically, 6-year 
cycles have rallied from trough to crest between 39–76 months with an average of 61 months. As of 
this writing in November 2025, the current 6-year cycle has been going up for 37 months from its 
start in October 2022. The appreciation of 6-year cycles has been between 116%–409% with an aver-
age of 241%. Based on these studies, the price target for the 6-year cycle crest is 34,300 with a range 
of 21,700–51,200. The current 6-year cycle has appreciated over 139% so far and is well within the 
target range already.
The historical range of decline from the crest to trough in all instances of the 6-year cycle has 
been 1–31 months, with an average of 12 months. The historical depreciation has seen a range of 
20%–78% with an average of 38%. Since we are in the third and final of three 6-year cycles within 
the greater 18-year cycle, the next 6-year cycle trough will also be the 9-year cycle and 18-year 
cycle trough. 
Summarizing the long-term cycle review, traders and investors must be alert to the possibility 
of a long-term cycle crest forming at any time now, as the 18-year cycle has already exceeded its 
historical range of time going up and appreciation. Thus, 2026 will likely be the year in which we 
will see the 18-year cycle crest forming. Looking at the sub-cycles of the 18-year cycle, we enter the 
time band for the crest to form within the next 2–11 months, when the 9-year and 6-year cycles start 
to enter their historical ranges. Both cycles have already entered the price target range for their crests. 
As long as price remains above the 22- and 33-month moving average on the monthly chart and 
the market is making new highs, we have not seen the 18-year cycle crest yet. The price target range 
for the crest, where the 9- and 6-year cycle price targets overlap, is 21,700–49,400. Once the crest is 
in, there will be a steep decline into the 18-year cycle trough, which is due in the next 2 years, and 
more specifically, where the time bands of the 18- and 6-year cycles overlap (February 2027–August 
2027). The decline will likely last between 1 and 31 months, with a depreciation of 33%–78% from 
the crest.
INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLES
Let’s now further analyze the intermediate-term cycles, as each long-term cycle contains smaller 
sub-cycles (the MMA principle of “cycles within cycles”), enabling us to make more refined market 
timing projections by breaking down and following these sub-cycles and formulate a trading plan for 
2026.

112
The 3-Year Cycle
The cycle that both the 9-year and 6-year cycles share is the 3-year cycle. Last year’s trading plan 
was built around the 3-year cycle trough that was expected between December 2024 and October 
2025. And indeed, it did culminate within this time band on April 7, 2025, at 14,784 in the NASDAQ. 
It was a sharp and quick decline of 27% from the 3-year cycle crest that formed on December 16, 
2024, at 20,205, and satisfied our criteria for a 3-year cycle low. We are now in the third and final 
3-year cycle phase of the greater 9-year cycle. That same 3-year cycle is also the third and final phase 
within the current 6-year cycle. This means the current 3-year cycle is the last intermediate-term 
cycle phase within the current 18-year cycle. 
November 2025 starts the 8th month of the current 3-year cycle. This is a great example of why 
MMA’s “cycles within cycles” principle is so valuable. By tracking and breaking down the intermedi-
ate-term cycles, we can get a detailed read on the long-term cycles and their development and status.
Since 1980, there have been 16 completed 3-year cycles observed in the NASDAQ. In 80% of 
the instances, the 3-year cycle in the NASDAQ has a normal length of 2.6 years or 31 months with 
a normal range of 26–36 months. Thus, the current 3-year cycle is due to bottom next between June 
2027 and April 2028. This overlaps with the time band of the long-term cycles from June 2027 to 
August 2027, making this a high probability time band for the 18-year cycle trough, where most 
cycles overlap (the “hot zone”).
Historically, in 80% of the cases, 3-year cycles have rallied between 10–37 months to their crest 
with an average of 26 months. As of this writing, the current 3-year cycle has been going up for 7 
months from its start in April 2025 and will enter the time band for its crest to form in 3 months (begin-
ning of 2026). By that time, the 6-year cycle will also have entered the time band for its crest. The 9-year 
cycle will enter the time band for its crest in October 2026, but let’s keep in mind that we are expecting 
a short 9-year cycle in which the crest could happen earlier than the historical time band.
