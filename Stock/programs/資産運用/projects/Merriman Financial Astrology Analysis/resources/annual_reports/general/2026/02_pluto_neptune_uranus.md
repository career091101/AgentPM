 THE CHART OF MODERN MANKIND
Freedom’s just another word 
for nothin’ left to lose.
—Janis Joplin, “Me and Bobby McGee,” written by Kris Kristofferson, 1971.
Last year, we introduced the “Horoscope of Modern Mankind,” which was presented by Claude 
Weiss at the MMA 2024 Investment Retreat, held September 19–22, 2024, in Lake Bled, Slovenia. 
This chart was originally proposed in 1992 by Eric Alan Meese in the magazine Welcome to Planet 
Earth, formerly published by astrologer Mark Lerner. We return to this chart again, as it shows further 
astrological developments supporting our view of the Aries Vortex and its potential for the ongoing 
monumental transformations taking place at this time in the history of humankind.
The chart of Modern Mankind is constructed on the last conjunction of the longest planetary 
synodic cycle known, which is between Neptune and Pluto. This conjunction cycle lasts between 492 
and 496 years and last occurred on April 30, 1892 (the third of three passes). Since the exact moment 
of that conjunction cannot be defined—because Neptune and Pluto move so slowly that they can 
occupy the same degree and minute for days—the new moon that preceded this conjunction is used 
as the starting point. That new moon was also a solar eclipse and thus magnified the importance of 
this cosmic event, which occurred on April 26. 
The time used for the advent of the chart of Modern Mankind is the solar eclipse of April 26, 
1892, at 9:47 PM GMT, just before the third and final passage of Neptune conjunct Pluto. The time 
of this eclipse is known to the exact minute and hence serves the purpose of a timed chart very well. 
The location chosen for this chart is Greenwich, England, since it serves as the prime meridian and 
reference point for world time (GMT). However, the chart could be relocated to any other location 
and the angles adjusted accordingly, which might be useful when identifying regions over which the 
outer planets transit the chart’s angles over time. For our purposes here, we will stay with GMT.
Note that at the time of the solar eclipse on April 26, 1892, the Sun and Moon (i.e., new moon) 
were in early Taurus, in opposition to Uranus in early Scorpio (see the chart below). This is important 
because Pluto will be transiting in a T-square to the natal Uranus and the Sun–Moon opposition in this 
chart from February 8, 2026, to February 6, 2028. 
With transits of Pluto, we have one basic rule: no one escapes unscathed under a hard Pluto 
transit to a natal point. In this case, the transit of Pluto relates to a global need to address a difficult 
situation confronting humankind. It won’t be easy. Something has to end in order for something 
new and better to begin. A major transformation for humanity—or the Earth itself—is called for, as 
threats to its existence, the lives of many people, or its basic economic or social stability may be at 
risk. This could be due to a natural calamity such as an earthquake, tsunami, hurricane, or volcanic 
eruption. It could be due to some kind of advancing existential threat, perhaps related to global warm-
ing or climate change. It could be in the form of a threat to humankind from a powerful leader who 
has the capability to put the lives of millions at risk. Or it could be a financial crisis, given that Pluto 
(planet of debt, deficits, downgrades, and defaults) is in the second house of finances, while the natal 
Moon—which rules the eighth house (financial crisis and debt) of this chart—is also involved. With 
natal Uranus activated, it indicates that the masses of humanity are in a mood to rebel or revolt in 

## Page 44

order to gain greater freedoms, rights, and even power. But it could also indicate that a world leader 
“loses his mind” and simply detaches from reality, putting others at great risk through a terrorist act. 
In other words, this can portend a very dangerous cosmic development, and it would be wise for 
leaders of the world to recognize when such a person or situation might present an existential threat 
to the world. 
Figure 5: Chart of Modern Mankind, “born” April 26, 1892, when Neptune conjoined Pluto, 
as seen from London, UK. Note: not only did Neptune conjoin Pluto on the Descendant, but 
the solar eclipse preceding this date (when the Sun and Moon conjoined at 7° Taurus) was 
also in opposition to Uranus at 3° Scorpio. 
With Pluto as the transiting planet, there may be an advance warning before an event erupts. 
Pluto events do not happen suddenly, although Uranus transits do, and both planets will be high-
lighted during the next two years. Readers must understand that with any powerful transit like this 
one involving Pluto, there are many ways an event may actually unfold. And if specific dangers are 
recognized before a major crisis erupts, changes can usually be made to prevent or minimize their 
impact. Pluto (and all planets) is an indicator of potential events, such as threats, but these do not 
necessarily manifest if conscious choices are made to express the positive potentials of the cosmic 
signatures involved. Instead of an actual crisis, Pluto can symbolize an awareness to make a major 
change in behavior before further troubles arise. Let’s hope our world leaders are astute and wise 
enough to spot a major threat to the masses if it arises, as indicated by this chart, and do something 

## Page 45

41
about it before any calamity occurs. Our duty as astrologers is to point out the timing of such pos-
sibilities, both positive and negative, but with the understanding that one can transform into the other. 
The outcome depends as much, if not more, on the choices humans make as it does on geocosmic 
aspects being causal. They correlate with human activity but are not to be considered purely causal.
Figure 6: Transits of August 11, 2026, to the chart of Mankind. Note the transit of Pluto forming a 
T-square with Uranus opposite the Sun–Moon conjunction in the natal chart, while transiting Uranus 
conjoins the natal Descendant, Neptune, and Pluto, and forms a trine to transiting Pluto. 
It would be enough to warrant our attention if Pluto were the only outer-planet transit active dur-
ing the next two years. However, that is not the case. All the outermost planets will be activated in 
2026 and even into 2027–2028. Uranus, for example, will be in early Gemini, transiting the Descen-
dant as well as the Neptune–Pluto conjunctions in the seventh house. This is quite fascinating because 
as Uranus, the disruptor, conjoins this powerful natal angular point, and also Neptune and Pluto, from 
July 24, 2026, through April 17, 2028, it will be forming a trine to Pluto in the skies. That is, transiting 
Uranus will conjoin Mankind’s Neptune and Pluto, while transiting Pluto will also be in a trine aspect 
with Neptune and Pluto in the Mankind chart. So, this is not a harbinger of total destruction or annihi-
lation but rather a symbol of death and rebirth. Once again, it is the theme of creative destruction—
the possibility that long-established directions and traditions of the human experience are ending, but 
as a result of something new being created (Uranus). We may think we have a clear vision of what 
this means, but with Uranus, we don’t really, for Uranus pertains to the unexpected and something 

## Page 46

42
completely new. But as with Uranus, the natal planet, the transit of Uranus also relates to the drive of 
the masses to attain freedom and new rights. With Uranus, the theme in an individual’s chart is that 
of a new lifestyle. But in this case, it is a new direction (lifestyle) for humanity as a whole, not just 
for certain individuals. One idea that comes to mind again is the exploration—and maybe even the 
settlement—somewhere outside of Earth, in outer space.
Transiting Saturn and Neptune will also be important in early 2026, as both will transit over the 
I.C. (bottom) of this chart. Saturn is especially noteworthy, for as it crosses the nadir (I.C.) of a chart, 
it symbolizes the end and beginning of a new cycle in the life of the entity. Generally speaking, this 
represents the bottom of the external part of one’s existence and the uphill climb to greater success 
and accomplishment over the next 17 years, until Saturn reaches the midpoint between the M.C. and 
Ascendant (around the middle of the eleventh house). This also bodes well for the future once Saturn 
crosses that threshold of Mankind’s nadir. 
In the final analysis, though, it is the transits of Pluto and Uranus that seem most critical to under-
stand and prepare for. It may be helpful to review some of our thoughts about this Chart of Mankind, 
as given last year, in order to further grasp the significance of what is about to be disrupted, brought 
to an end, and then reborn. As stated in Forecast 2025, “Another factor of the Chart of Modern Man-
kind that commands attention is the Solar Eclipse at 7° Taurus, in opposition to Uranus at 3° Scor-
pio. This represents a conflict between the wish for security and peace (Taurus) as well as financial 
opportunity (also Taurus) against the presence of strong forces of chaos and revolution (Uranus) that 
can put the lives of many in physical or financial danger (Scorpio). Taurus wants to build and enjoy 
security. But Scorpio (with Uranus involved) has an urge to tear down and rebuild all over again. 
Traditions (Taurus) can be upended by these revolutions and can disregard norms and customs that 
hold societies together.” This is the dynamic of human activity and civilization up until this point that 
Pluto is about to transform.

 PLUTO IN AQUARIUS: REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
Pluto’s slow, shadowed journey at the edge of our solar system mirrors its power to shape the 
deep currents of collective change. The farther a planet lies from the Sun, the greater its impact 
on mundane affairs. After fifteen years in Capricorn, Pluto began its twenty-year passage through 
Aquarius in March 2023. With a 248-year orbit, Pluto’s movements are rare markers of civilizational 
turning points. Where data cannot reach, astrology becomes our lens for interpreting how this shift 
may reverberate through markets and society alike.
Pluto governs transformation, regeneration, and power—the unseen forces behind debt, taxation, 
interest rates, and the mechanisms through which governments and central banks wield control. It 
is the planet of change, separation, death and rebirth, inheritance, windfall gains, destruction, and 
renewal. Ray calls it the planet of the four D’s: debt, deficits, downgrades, and defaults. Its energy is 
immense, catalytic, and often explosive. I consider it the higher octave of Mars; therefore, warfare 
and destruction usually accompany its initial ingress into a new sign (as seen with Russia–Ukraine 
and Israel–Hamas). 
Aquarius, by contrast, embodies humanity, equality, intellect, invention, and revolt. It is the sign 
of discovery, exploration, electricity, uranium, technology, forceful intervention, revolution, and the 
collective will. It represents the masses—the 99% of the population that controls 1% of the world’s 
wealth (in opposition to Leo, the 1% that controls 99% of global capital). With Jupiter in Leo form-
ing an opposition to Pluto in Aquarius in the summer of 2026, we could see this theme of financial 
polarization and social redistribution surface.
When Pluto enters Aquarius, the deepest forces of metamorphosis infiltrate the sign of the water 
bearer, carrying not the chalice of the individual soul but the amphora of collective life. As Pluto 
transits Aquarius, the unconscious energies of transformation tunnel through the latticework of col-
lective thought, shaking the very fabric of civilization. We stand at the threshold of profound social 
and structural transformation—a reconfiguration of power, technology, and belief that may alter the 
very foundations of our world.
Pluto first entered Aquarius on March 23, 2023, and after a couple of retrogrades back into Capri-
corn, it made its final ingress on November 19, 2024. It will remain in Aquarius until its final exit on 
January 19, 2044. This twenty-year arc echoes three previous transits upon which I based my study: 
April 1777 to December 1798; February 1532 to December 1553; and March 1286 to November 
1308. These are not fleeting influences but epochs that ushered in structural revolutions in belief, 
governance, science, and human self-conception. Each previous Pluto-in-Aquarius cycle coincided 
with tectonic global transformations whose consequences cascaded far beyond their own time. This 
one is no exception, as we have already seen with the advent of artificial intelligence and the trans-
formation it is creating.
When Pluto last entered Aquarius in 1777, the American colonies were in open revolt against 
monarchical rule. Within a year, France would recognize the nascent United States, and the world 
would witness the first modern democracy born of Enlightenment ideals embodied in the Declaration 

## Page 48

44
of Independence. Not long after, in 1789, the French Revolution would erupt, dismantling centuries 
of feudalism, aristocracy, and divine right. It was as though the axis of power (Pluto) shifted from 
Capricorn (the king and aristocracy) to Aquarius (the people). Amid the chaos, the Rights of Man 
were proclaimed and the metric system invented—symbols both of egalitarian vision and rational 
order. The old regimes, long upheld by religion and inherited privilege, cracked under the pressure 
of new ideologies. The guillotine’s blade was both literal and symbolic: it severed the head from the 
body politic, and the old world from the new. Yet even these revolutions carried their shadows: the 
French “Reign of Terror,” the rise of Napoleon, the American Revolutionary War, and the ironies 
of liberty built on the backs of enslaved people. Still, the structures of power had been irrevocably 
altered.
Numerous advances in science occurred in the years leading to Pluto’s 1777 ingress into 
Aquarius (an air sign). Chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele made several breakthroughs in chemistry, 
discovering oxygen (1771), barium (1772), chlorine (1774), manganese (1774), and molybdenum 
(1778). In 1778, Scottish scientist Daniel Rutherford isolated nitrogen gas from the air. These 
discoveries paved the way for the invention of the hot-air balloon by the Montgolfier brothers. 
Advancements in science go hand in hand with the development of technology. How fitting, then, 
that the Industrial Revolution is said to have begun during Pluto’s transit through Aquarius in the 
1780s. Are we on the cusp of a technological—or perhaps cyber—revolution? With Uranus (arti-
ficial, technological, electrical) ingressing into Gemini (intelligence, mind, networks, vehicles), 
we are already witnessing groundbreaking progress in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 
electric vehicles, and genetic technologies.
A cycle earlier, from 1532 to 1553, the Reformation tore through Europe. Luther’s challenge to 
Rome, ignited in 1517, had by this time become a conflagration of national and spiritual self-defi-
nition. In England, Henry VIII severed the Church of England from papal authority, solidifying the 
Protestant Reformation and setting the stage for the Industrial Revolution during Pluto’s next transit 
through Aquarius. Across Europe, Protestants and Catholics waged both ideological and military war, 
and the question of conscience (Aquarius) versus authority (Capricorn) came to define the age. Dur-
ing the same span, Copernicus’s heliocentric model was published, quietly dismantling the geocentric 
cosmos and elevating human reason as a force capable of dethroning dogma. These were not merely 
religious or scientific shifts—they were existential realignments of humanity’s place in the universe, 
orchestrated through Pluto’s invisible hand moving behind Aquarius’s crystalline lattice of ideas.
Reaching further back, the 1286–1308 transit marked the waning of the Crusades, the final fall of 
Acre in 1291, and the subsequent retreat of Christendom from the Holy Land. In Europe, the Mongol 
Empire fractured into khanates, and the Ottoman state was born faintly and quietly in Anatolia, yet 
destined to dominate the region for centuries. In Scotland, resistance to English rule culminated in 
the rise of Robert the Bruce, setting in motion a centuries-long national identity. These were stirrings 
of future empires, ideological partitions, and nationalist awakenings. Even in these less illuminated 
centuries, Pluto’s Aquarian pulse could be felt in the collective rearrangement of power and meaning.
Taken together, these epochs teach that Pluto in Aquarius does not merely transform govern-
ments or spark innovation—it rewires the circuitry of the collective mind. It is a time when invis-
ible convictions become visible architectures. Systems once thought immutable (divine right, papal 
authority, hereditary class, and egocentricity) collapse beneath the weight of new logic. This logic 
may be scientific, democratic, or spiritual, but it is always systemic. Aquarius does not tinker; it reen-
gineers. It does not evolve; it revolts. 

## Page 49

45
As we now enter the 2023–2044 transit, we do so already midstream in a sea of metamorphosis. 
The world is reeling from a pandemic that altered human interaction at every level (social, economic, 
and spiritual). Artificial intelligence, once the domain of speculative fiction, now crafts art, writes 
essays, and challenges our sense of creativity and authorship. Climate change is no longer a future 
threat but a present reality, compelling a reimagination of energy, consumption, and planetary stew-
ardship. Political systems are fraying under the weight of hyperpolarization, and the question of 
governance itself—who decides, how, and why—is under renewed scrutiny. These are not random 
disruptions; they are the signature of Pluto moving through Aquarius—a time when the infrastruc-
tures of thought and the blueprints of society are subject to collapse and renewal.
As Pluto shifts its axis of power from Capricorn into Aquarius, we may be standing at the thresh-
old of a profound change in the global monetary order. The age of the petrodollar—a distinctly Capri-
cornian symbol of control, structure, and authority—may be giving way to a new financial paradigm 
rooted in decentralization and digital innovation. This could manifest through the rise of cryptocur-
rencies or perhaps through a future reserve system anchored in blockchain technology, reflecting the 
Aquarian ideals of transparency, equality, and collective empowerment.
In much the same way, the centers of worldly influence appear to be shifting from the traditional 
sphere of politicians and institutions, shaped by Capricorn’s discipline and hierarchy, toward the 
visionary realm of technology leaders and digital pioneers. The Kissingers of old are being replaced 
by the Zuckerbergs and Jensen Huangs of the new—figures who shape global dynamics not through 
diplomacy and statecraft but through data, platforms, and artificial intelligence. One need only look 
at President Trump’s inner circle to see this transition unfolding, as the engines of political power 
become increasingly intertwined with the architecture of technology and the ambitions of a new kind 
of elite.
Aquarius, being fixed air, is the principle of ideational structure. It governs constitutions, tech-
nologies, collectives, and the unseen patterns that bind individual minds into societal order. When 
Pluto moves through this terrain, it brings the underworld’s depth to bear upon the sky’s abstraction. 
In practical terms, this may mean the exposure of corruption within institutions, the dissolution of 
dysfunctional systems, and the obsessive pursuit of new paradigms. Yet such changes are rarely 
smooth, as we have seen with the cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency 
(DOGE). The last time this transit occurred, liberty and terror walked hand in hand; before that, reli-
gious freedom gave way to inquisitions and wars. Pluto brings to light that which must decay—not to 
destroy for destruction’s sake, but to compost the soil of civilization for future growth.
In the years ahead, we may witness the reshaping of global alliances, the redefinition of rights in 
the digital and biological realms, and the rise of new forms of identity that transcend nation, gender, 
and tradition. Aquarius speaks of the group, but Pluto asks: at what cost? Surveillance technologies, 
biometric data, and algorithmic governance may promise efficiency yet threaten the very freedoms 
they aim to protect. The paradox of Aquarius is that its utopian impulse can, under Pluto’s pressure, 
veer into dystopia. What begins as collective liberation may end in technocratic control—unless tem-
pered by wisdom and ethical clarity.
Yet history shows that these are also times of extraordinary human brilliance. When the old world 
breaks, the new world becomes possible. The heliocentric model was heresy before it was astronomy. 
Democracy was treason before it became a principle. In each case, the seeds were sown during 
Pluto’s passage through Aquarius. 

## Page 50

In summary, these are the key recurring patterns identified from studying prior transits of 
Pluto through Aquarius. They represent the overarching undertone of mundane activity over 
the coming two decades:
•	
Revolution and rebellion: Political change in the structure of governance
•	
Major power transition: The fall of the old empire and the rise of the new
•	
Technological transformation: Intellectual progress through innovation
•	
Social reform and collective ideals: Expansion of rights and establishment of new social 
contracts
•	
Polarization and persecution: The “us vs. them” mentality taken to extremes
•	
Paradigm shift: Re-evaluation of fundamental truths and organizing principles 
•	
Exploration: Transformation in our understanding of the world and our place within it

 NEPTUNE IN ARIES: THE DAWN OF NEW DREAMS
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
When Neptune crosses the fiery threshold of Aries, the collective dream meets the first sign of the 
zodiac—the spark of beginnings, the will to incarnate, the courage to act. Neptune, planet of vision, 
dissolution, and transcendent imagination, moves with an almost unimaginable slowness, circling the 
Sun once every 165 years and spending approximately 14 years in each sign. It governs the tides of 
human consciousness, the rise and fall of ideals, the blurring of boundaries between what is seen and 
what is intuited. 
Aries, by contrast, is the archetype of emergence: cardinal fire, ruled by Mars—the pulse of ini-
tiative, the assertion of individuality. When the oceanic depth of Neptune enters the furnace of Aries, 
humanity is asked to dream not in abstraction but in motion, to translate longing into action, and to 
awaken through the heat of new beginnings. This meeting will define the years from March 30, 2025, 
when Neptune first entered Aries, to March 24, 2039, when it departs the sign for the final time. Nep-
tune will ignite the first degrees of the zodiac, closing the long Piscean era of surrender and faith and 
ushering in a cycle of spiritual confrontation and renewal. I have reviewed the prior three instances of 
Neptune in Aries—1533–1548, 1697–1712, and 1861–1875—each marked by revolution, invention, 
and a burning sense that the world was beginning again.
In the spring of 1533, when Neptune last blazed into Aries at the dawn of the modern age, Europe 
was splitting along lines of belief and power. Henry VIII’s break with Rome, John Calvin’s new the-
ology, and the first stirrings of the Council of Trent transformed religion from a single edifice into a 
battlefield of conscience. The Reformation tore the veil of medieval unity and authority, and behind it 
rose the sovereign state and the free (Aries) mind (Neptune). At the same time, Copernicus prepared 
De revolutionibus, shifting the cosmos itself: the Sun, not the Earth, at the center—an idea as radical 
then as the notion of artificial intelligence or space colonization is now. The conquistadors crossed 
oceans; the Jesuits crossed continents. The human spirit, intoxicated by its own potential, burned to 
claim and to know. As Neptune left Pisces for Aries, faith (Pisces) was transmuted into struggle, and 
revelation into discovery (Aries). The world’s map was redrawn, its heavens reimagined, and human-
ity stood—dazzled—on the brink of its modern identity and place in the cosmos. A paradigm shift 
had occurred.
A century and a half later, in 1697, Neptune again entered Aries beneath a sky of gunpowder and 
invention. Europe convulsed in the War of the Spanish Succession, while in the north Peter the Great’s 
armies shattered Sweden’s power and founded St. Petersburg on the Baltic marshes. These were wars 
not merely of territory but of principle: who would define the shape of empire, who would claim 
divine right, and who would harness the newborn engines of science. Newton’s Opticks appeared in 
1704, revealing that light consists of particles rather than waves—a paradox befitting Neptune’s mys-
tic symbolism. Locke’s empiricism and the first murmurs of Enlightenment reason spread through 
coffeehouses and pamphlets. Even the machines began to stir: Thomas Newcomen’s steam engine 
was built in 1712—a modest contraption pumping water from a mine, yet in it the Industrial Age took 
its first breath. Once again, Neptune’s mist met Aries’ flame, and out of the smoke rose a new vision 
of human power—the capacity to shape the material world through the imagination of the mind.

## Page 52

48
Then came 1861, and with it a thunderous repetition of the same motif on a planetary scale. 
This transit is particularly important, as it also found Uranus in Gemini and Jupiter in Leo—three of 
the five outer planets in the same signs where we find them again in 2026. The American Civil War 
erupted as Neptune entered Aries’ early degrees, a baptism of blood that forced a nation to reconcile 
its ideals with its deeds. In Europe, Garibaldi’s Redshirts marched for Italian unity, and Prussian can-
nons forged the German Empire. Across continents, the principle of nationhood, of collective identity 
born from struggle, seized humanity with martial fervor. The serfs of Russia were emancipated, slav-
ery was abolished in America, and new ideologies of socialism, feminism, and scientific humanism 
challenged the old order. The telegraph stitched oceans together, the Suez Canal joined seas, and the 
United States completed its first transcontinental railroad in 1869, uniting the two coasts. Mendeleev 
dreamed (Neptune) of the periodic table; Pasteur revealed the germ (Aries) theory (Neptune); and the 
descendants of the first practical steam (Neptune) engine (Aries) reshaped the rhythm of daily life as 
the world reached the height of the Second Industrial Revolution. Every realm of existence quick-
ened. It was as if the planet itself inhaled, braced, and charged forward, believing it could master 
destiny. Yet behind the triumphs lay the same Neptunian shadow: illusions of progress, the seductions 
of nationalism, the dream that machinery could redeem humanity. Out of these contradictions rose 
the modern world we still inhabit.
Now, once more, the tide returns. In 2025, Neptune entered Aries, and for the first time in living 
memory the collective imagination is being asked to start anew. We stand at the frontier of crises and 
possibilities that echo those earlier epochs, but on a scale their architects could not have conceived. 
The old Piscean age of faith, media saturation, and global diffusion is dissolving; the new age demands 
action, courage, and embodiment. The wars of religion have been replaced by battles of ideology and 
information, the Copernican revolution by the algorithmic one. Just as Copernicus displaced Earth from 
the center, artificial intelligence may soon displace humanity from the center of cognition. The question 
is not whether this will happen, but how consciously we will shape its unfolding.
Every prior Neptune-in-Aries generation has faced the same paradox: the promise of freedom 
and the peril of zeal. When the ocean (Neptune) enters the forge (Aries), the steam obscures as much 
as it reveals. The sixteenth century’s wars of faith cloaked ambition in piety; the eighteenth century’s 
Enlightenment hid conquest within reason; and the nineteenth century’s nationalism carried liberation 
and domination in the same breath. Our own age is poised between salvation and self-annihilation 
in equally Neptunian fashion. Climate change, the exhaustion of resources, and the digital coloniza-
tion of consciousness expose how thin the boundary has become between dream and delusion. Aries, 
impatient and absolute, demands decision. Neptune blurs every line. Together they create the atmo-
sphere of a holy war of the future—a moral urgency to act on visions that may or may not be true.
Yet from this tension arises the possibility of renaissance. The youth of the world—those born 
into climate anxiety and algorithmic life—may become new spiritual warriors, their rebellion not of 
territory but of meaning. As in 1533, when the word of God shifted from Latin pulpits to vernacu-
lar tongues, knowledge today is democratizing through digital networks. Voices long silenced find 
global amplification. Ideals of equality, ecological stewardship, and collective imagination surge 
across borders—sometimes chaotic, sometimes profound. Neptune in Aries tends to inflame the col-
lective heart; revolutions of conscience, such as the response to the Palestinian genocide, are its 
signature. We may see movements that combine technology with mysticism, activism with artistry—
arising from a generation seeking not escape but embodiment, replacing despair with the courage to 
attempt the impossible.

## Page 53

49
Technologically, the parallels are uncanny. Just as the 1700s cycle birthed the steam engine and 
the 1860s brought the telegraph and industrial expansion, this transit unfolds amid revolutions of 
comparable magnitude. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and renewable energy are today’s 
steam engines—tools that can either liberate or enslave, depending on the ideals guiding them. Aries 
insists on mastery; Neptune reminds us that mastery without meaning is illusion. Humanity’s chal-
lenge in these years is to wield innovation with conscience, to transform invention into stewardship. 
The coming decades will test whether our species has matured enough to fuse technological fire with 
spiritual humility.
Politically, Neptune in Aries coincides with the fragmentation of empires and the birth of new 
alignments. The sixteenth century saw monarchs wrest power from the papacy; the early eighteenth 
redefined the balance of Europe; the nineteenth forged nation-states from feudal ashes. In our time, 
globalization itself is fraying. Supply chains recoil inward, currencies digitize, and regions assert 
sovereignty over distant systems. Aries thrives on independence; Neptune erodes boundaries. Their 
meeting may produce both secession and synthesis—nations dissolving into networks, while net-
works harden into nations. The dream of unity may survive only through a higher form of diversity: 
a federation of consciousness rather than of commerce. Out of turbulence could emerge a new plan-
etary identity, forged not by empire but by shared vulnerability to climate, data, and destiny.
Economically, this cycle reveals a recurring theme: political turbulence exerting a direct impact 
on markets and financial structures, especially at the onset of the ingress. Historical patterns show that 
the first two to three years after Neptune enters Aries consistently mark a period of financial upheaval, 
speculative innovation, inflation, and structural revaluation. In each of the past three ingresses, old 
monetary or political systems broke down, giving rise to new instruments of credit, trade, and state 
power. The years 1533 to 1536 saw a massive reallocation of capital from the Church to private 
hands, resulting in a property boom followed by inflation and currency debasement in England. The 
years 1697 to 1700 brought financial innovation and the rise of public debt markets—initially under 
the newly founded Bank of England, but soon expanding into more speculative ventures such as the 
South Sea and Mississippi Companies, which ultimately led to a financial crash. The period from 
1861 to 1864 introduced fiat currency (the first paper “greenbacks”) and speculative industrial expan-
sion amid global conflict. Gold and silver prices soared, then collapsed as confidence fluctuated.
Each cycle began with dislocation and exuberance, as faith or ideology shifted and old systems or 
currencies broke down, forcing the creation of new instruments of credit and trade. It is worth noting 
that the current Bretton Woods system—with the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency—is cur-
rently in tatters. On one side lies an unsustainable degree of national debt, driven by decades of budget 
deficits in the global North; on the other, the confiscation of approximately $640 billion in Russian 
national reserves frozen in 2022 in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Combined, these forces have 
significantly eroded trust in the system, spurring the global South, led by the BRICS nations, toward 
the Chinese yuan as they attempt to anchor it to gold through the so-called “gold corridor”—a global 
network of vaults facilitating the conversion of U.S. Treasuries into gold. It is also worth noting that 
the Federal Reserve is really going to struggle to retain control over the economy if it faces a market 
crash and high inflation simultaneously. Both scenarios are on the table over the next three years.
The prior cycles were also accompanied by speculative surges, as optimism outran fundamen-
tals and capital chased new “frontiers” (religious reform, colonial expansion, industrial technol-
ogy, or postwar rebuilding). We are currently seeing similar speculation and a potential bubble 

## Page 54

forming around technology stocks and AI (see the boom–bust cycle discussed in the Uranus-in-
Gemini section).
History also warns that every birth of vision carries its delirium. The Reformation begot inquisi-
tions; the Enlightenment, colonialism; nationalism, world wars. The next danger may be ideologi-
cal absolutism disguised as moral clarity. Digital tribes already wage crusades across screens; truth 
becomes fluid, belief weaponized. Neptune clouds, Aries polarizes—and together they form a dan-
gerous combination. The task for the wise is to see through both illusions: to act without fanaticism, 
to dream without escape. 
As the transit deepens through the 2030s, we may see breakthroughs in fusion energy, space 
exploration, and consciousness studies. Humanity may extend its reach beyond Earth even as it con-
fronts the limits of its own habitat. The symbolism is clear: the frontier outside mirrors the frontier 
within. The question is not only how far out we can go, but also how far in. Each prior Neptune-in-
Aries era believed it was entering a new world—one that would mark a paradigm shift.
In summary, these are the key recurring patterns I have identified from studying the last three 
transits of Neptune through Aries. Beneath the overarching undertone set by Pluto, Neptune will cast 
the light through which mundane activity will manifest over the next thirteen years:
• 
War and the birth of new orders: Each transit coincided with major conflicts that 
shattered old structures and ushered in new political orders. 
• 
Ideological and spiritual revolution: Every period witnessed a surge of new ideas, 
ideologies, and mass movements that challenged prevailing orthodoxies.
• 
Technological and scientific breakthroughs: Each transit aligned with game-changing 
innovations that expanded humanity’s capabilities and understanding.
• 
Social upheaval and reform: Each period brought intense social stress and 
transformation, as entrenched orders were challenged and new rights or reforms 
emerged.
• 
Financial upheaval, speculative innovation, inflation, and structural revaluation: 
Each cycle began with dislocation and exuberance, as faith or ideology shifted into 
material enterprise, followed by correction and consolidation that defined the next 
economic era.

 URANUS IN GEMINI: THE COMMUNICATIONS RENAISSANCE
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
When Uranus steps into the sign of Gemini, it is a crossing from the slow solidity of Taurus into 
the realm of mutable air—a passage from the weight of matter to the quicksilver of mind. Uranus 
moves in an 84-year circuit (spending roughly seven years in each sign), and each time it returns to 
Gemini, it electrifies the human nervous system: the world begins to think, speak, and connect in 
ways that were previously unimagined. From its first hesitant ingress in July 2025, through a brief 
retreat into Taurus, to its full re-entry in April 2026, Uranus will inhabit Gemini until May 2033. 
These dates mark not merely a planetary sojourn but the threshold of a global reconfiguration of 
information, alliances, and our means of communication. To grasp its meaning, we must listen back-
ward through history to the echoes of earlier transits, for Uranus in Gemini has always spoken in the 
language of sudden correspondence.
In astrology, Uranus is the planet of disruption, innovation, revolution, and awakening. It carries 
the spark of the divine mind that refuses containment, the Promethean impulse to liberate. It is the 
only planet that rotates almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, with an axial tilt of 98°. It is 
literally the rebel, standing up and throwing its fist (ring) into the air in objection to the status quo. It 
is the disruptor, and it will disrupt everything linked or related to the sign through which it transits. 
Gemini, ruled by Mercury, is the mutable air sign of thought and exchange: twin-formed, curious, 
restless, ever in dialogue. Therefore, Gemini represents communication, trade, exchange, transport, 
information flow, education, and public opinion. In mundane astrology, it is the nervous system of 
a nation and governs the media, telecommunications, networks, roads, railways, diplomacy, and the 
intellectual exchanges that bind societies together.
When the electric principle of Uranus moves through this sign, intellect and invention become 
instruments of revolution. Ideas cross borders faster than armies, and the structure of communication 
itself becomes the field of transformation. The marriage of Uranus and Gemini produces the same 
signature each time: an acceleration of intellect, a division of narratives, and the birth of technologies 
that reshape perception. Uranus is the celestial force that breaks patterns and brings abrupt change, 
chaos, and instability into the lives of Gemini natives or nations. On the positive side, it can also bring 
about creative and intellectual breakthroughs. Uranus also rules over the boom–bust cycle, so we may 
anticipate a sudden rally as a bubble forms and subsequently bursts in the sector of the market ruled 
by Gemini (including technology, AI, communication, cars, satellites, and network companies).
The historical record of Uranus in Gemini is startlingly consistent. The last transit unfolded 
between 1941 and 1949, years in which the world both destroyed and remade itself. In 1942, as 
Uranus advanced through the early degrees of Gemini, the Second World War reached its global cre-
scendo. Air warfare, radar, and coded communication—the very tools of Gemini’s domain—decided 
the fate of nations. In 1945, as Uranus reached mid-Gemini, the atom was split, and the voice of 
destruction became instantaneous. Yet at that same moment, humanity invented the frameworks that 
would govern peace: the United Nations was founded, the Bretton Woods system was drafted, and 
the Nuremberg principles were articulated. The duality of Gemini could not be clearer: division and 
reconciliation, annihilation and the promise of dialogue. The war’s aftermath birthed the Iron Curtain 
and NATO, dividing the planet into two ideological twins. Even the earliest computers—ENIAC in 

## Page 56

52
1946 and the transistor in 1947—arose under this transit, giving literal form to Mercury’s dream of 
instantaneous logic. Uranus in Gemini wrote the blueprint of the information age.
A century earlier, from 1858 to 1866, the same planet traced this sign across a world humming 
with telegraph wires. The first transatlantic cable was completed in 1858 and announced the end of 
isolation. News could now cross the oceans faster than wind. The American Civil War, fought from 
1861 to 1865, unfolded entirely within this Uranian air—a conflict over union and division, slavery 
and freedom, Gemini’s eternal polarity made manifest in politics. During those years, Abraham Lin-
coln signed the Emancipation Proclamation (1863), and Alexander Graham Bell, still a boy, began 
the experiments that would culminate in the telephone. Meanwhile, in Europe, Otto von Bismarck’s 
Prussia engineered the wars that would unify Germany, and in 1863 Henri Dunant founded the Red 
Cross, leading to the Geneva Convention—a humanitarian (Uranus) code (Gemini) of communica-
tion amid carnage. Each event echoed the same archetype: conflict that compels new networks of 
meaning, and innovation that arises from fracture.
Step further back to 1774–1782, and Uranus in Gemini oversaw the American Revolution. The 
Declaration (Gemini) of Independence (Uranus) was signed in 1776; Thomas Paine’s Common Sense 
circulated in every tavern; pamphleteering replaced the pulpit as the instrument of ideology. It was 
not only a war of muskets but of words. Across the Atlantic, the early Industrial Revolution gathered 
momentum—James Watt’s improved steam engine was patented in 1781, transforming movement 
and communication alike. In philosophy, Immanuel Kant published The Critique of Pure Reason in 
1781, redefining how humanity conceived knowledge itself. The themes converge again: rebellion 
of thought, mechanical invention, and the moral experiment of a new social order. Gemini’s dual-
ity manifested as liberty and empire, the twin offspring of Enlightenment. A noteworthy discovery 
during this period was that of the planet Uranus itself, by the astronomer William Herschel in 1781.
The earlier transit, from roughly 1690 to 1698, coincided with England’s financial and informa-
tional revolution. The Bank of England was founded in 1694; the first daily newspapers appeared; 
coffee houses became the neural nodes of a new public sphere. Isaac Newton, recently appointed 
Master of the Mint, stabilized the currency system even as his Opticks redefined light and perception. 
Ideas traveled through pamphlets and postal systems with unprecedented velocity. It was during these 
years that the modern concepts of “news” and financial speculation took shape—both Gemini cre-
ations, transforming knowledge and rumor into tradable commodities. The spirit of Uranus electrified 
Mercury’s domain of commerce and intellect, fusing them into a single current. 
The earliest Uranus-in-Gemini passage examined in this study was from 1606 to 1614. During 
this period, Galileo turned his telescope toward Jupiter’s moons. In 1609, he constructed the first 
refracting telescope; in 1610, he published the Sidereus Nuncius, ironically during a Jupiter–Uranus 
conjunction in Gemini. That same year, Johannes Kepler described the laws of planetary motion, 
mapping the harmony of the spheres with mathematical precision. In 1611, the King James Bible 
appeared in England, reshaping language itself. Across continents, Jesuit scholars carried European 
astronomy to China and brought back maps and translations that redrew the world. The very sky 
changed shape beneath Uranus in Gemini, as did the mind that contemplated it. 
These five epochs form a rhythm that can be read like a long-wave signal pulsing through history. 
Each time Uranus entered Gemini, humanity underwent a communications revolution that redefined 
what connection meant. Each time, a new technology of thought was born: telescope, newspaper, 
telegraph, computer, network—and now we have AI and quantum computing. Each time, the world 

## Page 57

53
divided into opposing yet interdependent halves. And each time, out of war or upheaval, a moral reor-
ganization followed—a redefinition of freedom, of human rights, and of the laws by which dialogue 
is maintained. Uranus in Gemini does not merely accelerate change; it teaches civilization how to 
speak to itself again—through a declaration or charter, a humanitarian (Uranus) contract (Gemini) 
setting the boundaries for civil society and the promise of “never again.” Yet reviewing the cycles 
from these perspectives raises the question of whether turmoil is a prerequisite for evolution.
As the 2025 ingress takes effect, the world is once again polarized and overconnected. Informa-
tion moves faster than comprehension; communication technologies are rewriting the conditions of 
truth. Artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and low-orbit satellite constellations mirror the 
telegraph and radio of earlier ages—tools that shrink space and test the integrity of meaning. Just 
as the telegraph once promised unity but delivered both commerce and espionage, today’s networks 
offer enlightenment and vulnerability to distortion in equal measure. The archetype is consistent: 
Gemini multiplies messages and analysis; Uranus disrupts their order. The result is revelation fol-
lowed by reformation.
If the mid-twentieth century brought physical reconstruction, the twenty-first will bring recon-
struction of mind. The transit of Uranus through Gemini from 2025 to 2033 may not only redraw 
national borders as it once did but also redraw the architecture of cognition and society. We are likely 
to witness the formal emergence of parallel digital worlds—dual standards of data, AI, and gover-
nance that mirror Gemini’s twin nature. As in 1947–48, when the Iron Curtain descended and nations 
were partitioned in two (Palestine, India, Germany, and Korea), ideological networks may solidify 
into two rival yet intertwined systems. But there is also the promise of synthesis: Uranus, though dis-
ruptive, seeks revolution, for the sake of progress, not destruction. Out of polarity may come interop-
erability—a new form of communication between opposites, where rivalry compels innovation.
The space race has been replaced by the AI race. Just as Charles Darwin formulated his theory 
of evolution under this sky (1859), could the next leap in human evolution also take place as Uranus 
once again returns to Gemini? The sequence of mechanization has progressed from bicycles, cars, 
and trains doing the work of the human feet, to industrial machines doing the work of our hands, and 
now to AI performing the work of the mind. Can we skip a beat in this acceleration and reach quan-
tum computing doing the work of the spirit, expanding our perception of the fourth dimension? The 
next seven years will bring a whirlwind (Gemini) of change (Uranus).
History also warns that periods of Uranus in Gemini coincide with moral turning points. The 
abolition of slavery in the 1860s, the human rights declarations of the 1940s, and the philosophical 
humanism of the Enlightenment all arose under this sky. The coming decade may confront the ethical 
boundaries of intelligence itself—what it means to be conscious, accountable, or truthful in an age 
when speech is mechanized. Laws of information and identity will emerge as defining instruments of 
civilization, much as the Geneva Convention once was. We may see the codification of digital per-
sonhood or the first serious treaties on artificial cognition—expressions of the same moral imperative 
to protect communication as the foundation of humanity. 
Economically, Uranus’s departure from Taurus and entry into Gemini signals a shift from disrup-
tions in the banking system and money to disruptions in technology, transportation, and information 
networks, exchanges, and global trade. In 1609, Amsterdam opened the first stock exchange. A free 
(Uranus) market (Gemini) was born, allowing market participants to set and speculate on the price of 
assets. During the next transit, the Bank of England was formed in 1694, creating value out of thin air 

## Page 58

54
(Gemini) through the use of contracts that established the modern national debt system. During the 
next transit (1774–82), the American colonies financed revolution through paper currency and war 
bonds. Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776, laying the theoretical groundwork for 
free (Uranus) trade (Gemini) and specialization—an idea that would go on to reshape economics and 
drive globalization. During the next transit (1858–66), the transatlantic telegraph allowed near-instant 
price arbitration between London and New York, creating the first truly synchronized global market. 
The same period birthed modern investment banking, led by the Rothschilds, Barings, and J.P. Mor-
gan’s precursors. During this transit, the modern oil industry was also born in Pennsylvania, which 
would go on to transform (Uranus) the markets and transportation (Gemini). Finally, during the last 
transit (1941–1949), war financing and postwar reconstruction rewrote the financial order under the 
Bretton Woods Agreement, which created the World Bank, IMF, and the dollar’s ascendancy.
So, we can see a clear pattern of financial innovation, as each cycle births a new instrument or 
infrastructure of exchange, aided by advances in technology that enhance the communication of 
information. Yet the improved flow of information and financial systems does not eliminate crashes 
or speculative bubbles, which were once driven by production changes alone. The new systems born 
under the air sign of Gemini incorporate trust and gossip into valuations. Nearly every transit begins 
with speculative excess or debt stress (1609 Tulip Mania, the Panic of 1857, 1940s wartime infla-
tion and debt) that results in a market crash. Each prior transit has started with disruptions to trade 
routes (usually through war) and ended with treaties and a new world order of exchange promoting 
free trade and radically expanded trade corridors. Each cycle has also seen a transition from tangible 
to abstract values, with each era dematerializing wealth one step further: from spices to shares, from 
gold to credit, from labor to data.
Given the historical rhythm, the current transit suggests another financial reset driven by war—
whether national or trade-based. This shift is likely to bring about digital currencies, blockchain-
based settlements, and AI-mediated trade clearing, echoing the telegraph’s transformative impact in 
the nineteenth century. Market volatility can be expected around the emerging “protocol wars” of 
value, including standards for digital money, cross-border compliance, and identity verification. As 
in 1694 and 1944, it is new institutions—this time technology giants, rather than empires—that are 
poised to rise to power. Periodic shocks are almost certain, as Uranian surges tend to inflate innova-
tion before stabilizing it through market corrections. As you move through the coming chapters, you 
will see that our cyclical studies point to the same event: the 18-year trough in stock markets and the 
4-year trough in cryptocurrencies, both due in the early stages of this transit, continuing the uncanny 
rhythm of history.
Since its formation, the United States has been drawn into major conflicts during every transit 
of Uranus through Gemini, a pattern deeply embedded in the nation’s history. These include the 
American Revolutionary War in 1775, the Civil War in 1861, and the country’s entry into World 
War II in 1941 following the attack on Pearl Harbor. This consistent rhythm suggests a strong cor-
relation between Uranus in Gemini and American involvement in war, raising the likelihood of a 
similar outcome during the upcoming transit from 2025 to 2033. Saturn’s cycle through Gemini 
also shows a marked association with both financial recessions and periods of conflict in the United 
States. The conjunction of Saturn and Uranus in Gemini, expected in 2032, implies that if the nation 
becomes engaged in warfare, the decisive phase is most likely to occur toward the end of this transit. 
If involvement were to begin earlier, the same configuration indicates that the engagement could 
continue until approximately 2032.

As Uranus marches through Gemini, these are the nations to keep a close eye on: Armenia, 
Wales, Belgium, Indonesia, Egypt, the United States, Yemen, Jordan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, South 
Africa, Zimbabwe, Qatar, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. Uranus will disrupt the status quo as it 
transits through the natal sign of nations and individuals alike—as it did in Britain (Aries) with the 
2016 Brexit referendum, or in Syria (Aries) with the 2011 uprising that marked the start of the civil 
war, when Uranus transited Aries (2010–2018). We saw the same pattern of turmoil and upheaval 
encompass Israel (Taurus) during Uranus’s transit through Taurus. We also witnessed the 2018 abor-
tion referendum in Ireland (Taurus) and the 2021 deadly Limassol wildfires in Cyprus (Taurus). 
Therefore, a wave of popular revolt, demonstrations, referendums, natural disasters, or conflict is 
likely to arise in several of the Gemini countries.
For individuals born under the influence of Gemini, this transit can be both liberating and desta-
bilizing, as Uranus brings immense disruptions along with moments of genius. Among those who 
carry this signature is the president of the United States, Donald Trump, a Gemini native who also 
has natal Uranus in Gemini, reflecting an inherently rebellious and unconventional temperament. His 
style exemplifies the disruptive brilliance and contrarian energy often associated with this placement. 
Another significant figure is President Xi Jinping of China, also a Gemini native, whose leadership 
embodies a different manifestation of this archetype: strategic adaptability and mastery of narrative 
control. It is also noteworthy that President Volodymyr Zelensky has his Ascendant in Gemini, while 
President Vladimir Putin’s natal Moon occupies the same sign. The ongoing transit of Uranus through 
Gemini is therefore likely to exert a pronounced influence on these leaders, shaping not only their 
personal trajectories but also the collective direction of the nations they represent.
 The historical record shows recurring clusters of famine, climatic instability, and geophysical 
disruption during prior transits of Uranus in the air sign of Gemini. The 1606–1614 transit coincided 
with one of the harshest phases of the “Little Ice Age” in Europe. The “Great Frost” devastated crops, 
leading to famine. At the same time, the Jamestown colony in Virginia endured the “Starving Time,” 
when almost the entire population perished. In 1609, the Great Bristol Channel Flood remains the 
greatest natural disaster recorded in Wales (Gemini). Between 1693 and 1698, crop failures struck 
Scotland, Scandinavia, France, and large parts of Central Europe. The so-called “Seven Ill Years” in 
Scotland killed perhaps 15% of the population, and Finland lost a third of its people. In 1775–76, 
poor harvests struck Europe and India, while in 1780 a major hurricane (extreme wind—Uranus in 
Gemini) devastated the Caribbean, killing more than 20,000 people. During 1858–66, the “Global 
Famine of the 1860s,” caused by a series of droughts, killed millions throughout India, China, South-
east Asia, northern Africa, and parts of Latin America. 
Between 1941 and 1949, famine struck again, yet this time it was not caused by weather pat-
terns but by mismanagement. The Bengal Famine of 1943 claimed an estimated three to four million 
lives in India, while the Iranian Famine of 1942–1943 is believed to have caused up to five million 
deaths—nearly a third of Iran’s population at the time. Iran was officially a neutral state at the outset 
of World War II. Both crises unfolded under British or Allied wartime administration, yet neither 
has been formally acknowledged or addressed by the British government. Together, they account 
for roughly nine million lives lost, far exceeding Britain’s own wartime death toll of about 450,000. 
These events remain politically and historically sensitive. For many years, both famines were subject 
to censorship and limited public discussion. What is important to note is that neither famine was 
caused by a lack of food but rather by distribution (Gemini) failures (Uranus), as both grain and 
transportation were diverted and prioritized to support Britain’s war efforts. Astrologically, they can 

## Page 60

56
be seen as reflecting a darker aspect of Uranus in Gemini: a period associated with disruptions in 
communication, logistics, and the flow of vital resources.
Therefore, the upcoming cycle (2025–2033) warrants attention to climate-linked supply chains 
and information systems that could result in famine. Periods of extreme weather, drought, flooding, 
or cold snaps could be magnified by simultaneous shocks in data infrastructure, transport, or markets. 
This aligns well with MMA Agricultural Analyst Wyatt Fellows’ forecast of droughts within the orb 
of Saturn–Neptune hard aspects, which will be in force during 2026. In the air sign of Gemini, one 
would imagine that the disruption will be caused by weather-driven factors, yet we cannot rule out 
disruptions to satellite networks, maritime corridors, or trade wars.
Yet beneath all these material and political manifestations lies a subtler transformation: a muta-
tion in human consciousness. When Uranus passes through Gemini, perception itself accelerates. 
The collective mind becomes nervous, curious, polyphonic. During the 1770s, it wrote revolution-
ary pamphlets; during the 1860s, it read telegrams; during the 1940s, it tuned into radio broadcasts 
and early computers. Now it will converse with algorithms—reflections of its own thought rendered 
autonomous. This transit will not simply connect humanity outwardly but confront it with its own 
mirrored intelligence. Gemini, after all, is the sign of twins—of dialogue and duplication. We will 
speak to our machines and discover that they answer in kind. The question is whether we will recog-
nize ourselves in the echo.
Still, the pattern offers hope. Every Uranus-in-Gemini epoch has, after its storms, produced struc-
tures of cooperation and understanding. Out of the chaos of 1610 came scientific method; out of 1776 
came democratic ideals; out of 1945 came global governance. The cycle reveals that disorder is the 
price of invention, and communication is the remedy for division. As we navigate the next seven 
years, the task is not to fear the multiplicity of voices but to find coherence among them. 
By the time Uranus departs Gemini in May 2033, humanity will inhabit a transformed landscape 
of mind. The technologies born under this sky will define the rest of the century, just as the telegraph 
defined the nineteenth and the computer the twentieth. The cycles of Uranus remind us that enlight-
enment and upheaval are twins. Each epoch of this planet’s passage through Gemini has carried both 
catastrophe and creation, each inseparable from the other. The telescope shattered the heavens to 
reveal their order; the atom bomb shattered the world to reveal its conscience.
If we listen carefully to the rhythm of history, we hear the same message repeated every 84 
years: the world must learn to speak anew. The next great language is already forming in the invisible 
ether—between human and machine, between one culture and another, between thought and code. 
Uranus in Gemini opens that channel, and through it we will either rediscover our unity or amplify 
our division. The choice, as ever, lies not in the stars but in the minds that read them.
In summary, the following key recurring patterns emerge from this study of the last five transits of 
Uranus through Gemini. Beneath the overarching undertone set by Pluto and Neptune, these themes 
represent the lower octaves through which mundane activity will manifest over the next seven years:
•	
Major wars shifting into a new order: Conflicts that often redraw the world’s political map 
and create partitions or twin states. During prior cycles, the United States has always been 
involved in a military conflict.

## Page 61

57
•	
Ideological polarization and alliances: Hand in hand with the war theme, these periods see 
the solidification of alliances or blocs. The world tends to bifurcate into opposing strategic 
camps.
•	
Technological and intellectual breakthroughs: Information, communication, and techno-
logical revolutions. We see a “shrinking world” effect as society’s connectivity dramatically 
increases.
•	
Scientific and intellectual paradigm shifts: Landmark intellectual leaps that change how 
humanity understands nature and society.
•	
Social progress in human rights: The formation of frameworks and alliances grounded in 
equality, ethical responsibility, and fair governance. 
•	
Natural disasters and famine: Periods of extreme weather and environmental stress.

 SATURN IN ARIES: BUILDING THROUGH FIRE
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
When Saturn entered Aries on 24 May 2025, humanity stood once again at a threshold between 
worlds. The slowest of the visible planets, Saturn governs the architecture of reality—the laws, insti-
tutions, economies, and moral codes that define civilization. Saturn’s orbit around the Sun is about 
30 years, spending roughly 2.5 years in each zodiac sign. Saturn is the outermost of the interpersonal 
planets and governs how we interact with society. Therefore, it rules over the political and economic 
structures, discipline, restriction, constraint, order, systems, traditional values, and accountability.
By contrast, Aries signifies beginnings, assertion, warfare, leadership, and the birth of new orders. 
As the first sign of the zodiac and the cardinal fire archetype, it represents the principle of initiation, 
the surge of will that propels history into motion. Aries governs nations and movements that act rather 
than deliberate, emphasizing independence, courage, and self-determination. It rules the military, 
pioneering industries, and all forms of enterprise that demand direct action. In the collective psyche, 
Aries awakens the impulse to define identity and take decisive steps forward in search of freedom, 
free trade, free press, liberalism, and independence. Economically, it correlates with entrepreneur-
ial risk-taking, rapid innovation, and volatile but creative market phases—periods when the world 
prefers to act first and calculate later, forcing both progress and upheaval in equal measure. Nations 
traditionally associated with Aries include Imperial Iran (prior to the 1978 Islamic Revolution), Syria, 
Palestine, England, Germany, and Denmark. 
When Saturn enters Aries, the planet of order and restraint moves into the sign of impulse and 
initiation. The two energies are contradictory and at odds; therefore, ancient astrologers classified 
Aries as the sign of Saturn’s fall, where its stabilizing power is weakened and turns into a destabiliz-
ing force. In this sign, discipline gives way to urgency, and established systems struggle to contain 
the surge of new will. Institutions that rely on continuity or caution often lose coherence as authority 
fragments and individual actors seize initiative. The result is a world in transition: structures dissolve 
faster than they can be rebuilt, leaders act without consensus, and markets or governments may swing 
between bold innovation and reckless instability. 
When the planet of structure traverses the sign of impulse, history tends to convulse. Rules are 
rewritten in the very act of their breaking. Old empires stiffen and fall, while new systems, forged in 
haste or courage, arise to take their place. Saturn will remain in Aries until 12 April 2028, yet it is the 
initial ingress over 0° Aries, the world axis, that forms an integral part of the Aries Vortex. We got 
a prelude to this when both Saturn and Neptune ingressed into Aries and came within minutes of an 
exact conjunction in the summer of 2025. 
To understand the gravity of the coming years, one must look back through the lens of economic 
and social history. In my study, I have reviewed the past ten transits of Saturn through Aries, stretch-
ing back to 1731. Saturn in Aries has long coincided with periods when the engines of production and 
trade seize, reset, or leap forward through invention. This transit also tends to mark—or immediately 
follow—major market contractions, credit crises, or the end of speculative booms, often accompa-
nied by a revaluation of precious metals and a shift in monetary systems. Saturn’s fall in Aries, where 
order yields to volatility, translates economically into a loss of confidence in established markets and 

## Page 63

59
a pivot toward tangible assets like gold and silver. These are periods when liquidity tightens, risk 
appetite collapses, and structural reforms in finance or trade are forced into being. Yet paradoxically, 
they also set the stage for new cycles of growth once Saturn leaves Aries and stability (Saturn) gradu-
ally returns in Taurus.
In 1731–34, Britain and Austria (the two leading empires of Europe) realigned their alliances 
under the Treaty of Vienna, inaugurating a new balance of mercantile power. At the same time, the 
last great wars of European succession disrupted the old trading monopolies. London’s coffee houses, 
home to insurers and early financiers, buzzed with speculation as the Enlightenment’s first market 
revolutions took shape. The founding of Georgia as a debtors’ colony embodied the Aries motif of 
risk and renewal—a social experiment in economic rehabilitation. Even Voltaire’s Letters on the 
English Nation (1734) can be read as a manifesto for the moral economy of capitalism: that work and 
rational order might replace the inertia of inherited privilege. In the markets, this brought about a new 
era of prudence, an economic “reset” phase in which the financial system was institutionalized after 
the chaos and speculation of the South Sea and Mississippi bubbles (1720). 
Three decades later, in 1761–63, Saturn returned to Aries under the roar of cannon fire. The 
Seven Years’ War, called the first global war, concluded with the Treaty of Paris in early 1763, 
redrawing the economic map of the world. Britain emerged as the hegemon of trade and empire; 
France was humbled; India and North America were opened to new exploitation. Behind the diplo-
macy lay a deeper shift: the birth of the industrial economy. Within two years of Saturn’s exit, 
James Watt perfected the steam engine. The war’s fiscal burdens forced Britain to tax its colonies, 
sparking the first modern wave of taxation-induced crisis, which went on to ignite the American 
Revolution. Saturn in Aries thus left its imprint as a financial reckoning—victory purchased with 
debt, a new era bought at the price of an old one’s stability. During the war, naval blockades dis-
rupted the Spanish silver trade from Mexico and Peru to Europe. This resulted in a surge in the 
price of silver, which quickly crashed once the embargo was lifted and the markets were swamped 
with a backlog of shipments. 
When Saturn returned to Aries in 1790–93, the old order collapsed entirely. The French Revolu-
tion hurled Europe into both ideological and economic crisis. Assignats, revolutionary paper money, 
flooded the markets, their value dissolving amid hyperinflation (Saturn–Neptune opposition) and 
destroying the old empire’s monetary system. Property was nationalized, guilds abolished, and the 
medieval system of privilege dismantled in a frenzy of liberation and confiscation. Across the Atlan-
tic, the United States ratified its Bill of Rights and stabilized its new financial institutions under 
Hamilton’s reforms, demonstrating Saturn’s other face: structure after upheaval. At the same time, 
the Polish Constitution of 1791 attempted to modernize a faltering state, only to be partitioned away 
within two years—a reminder that not every rebirth endures. The Haitian uprising of 1791 echoed 
this theme economically as well as politically: plantation capitalism itself was set aflame. This was 
the first successful slave rebellion, which ultimately led to the abolition of slavery and acted as the 
catalyst for the broader Haitian Revolution and the first independent Black republic.
In the markets, Alexander Hamilton’s new federal debt system launched Wall Street’s first specu-
lative boom, followed by the Panic of 1792, a violent credit contraction. At the same time, gold and 
silver coinage became scarce, as France melted church treasures while Britain began to hoard gold 
ahead of the Napoleonic wars. This was, in effect, a global liquidity crisis, as paper money was dis-
credited and bullion prices rose, reaching a crest in 1810–15 during the Napoleonic War.

The next cycle, 1819–22, carried the same double current of revolution and restraint. The post-
Napoleonic world convulsed in the Revolutions of 1820, as Spain, Portugal, and the Italian states 
demanded constitutional limits (Saturn) on royal power (Aries). Their aspirations were crushed by 
Austrian and French intervention, but the idea of liberal economics, free trade, free press, and free 
enterprise had been released. Across the Atlantic, those ideals bore fruit: Mexico and Brazil declared 
independence, and Simón Bolívar’s armies forged the republics of South America. These were not 
merely political acts but seismic economic transformations. The silver routes of the old empire 
shifted; tariffs and monopolies fell. Yet even freedom carried Saturn’s price. The British industrial 
engine, now dominant, imposed its own invisible empire through finance and manufacturing, binding 
the new nations in webs of debt. The United States experienced the Panic of 1819, its first nationwide 
depression, as commodity prices and land values collapsed, banks failed, and unemployment soared. 
Britain formally restored the gold standard (1819), enforcing deflationary discipline as gold’s con-
vertibility became the bedrock of modern finance. It is worth noting that this cannot all be attributed 
to Saturn, as Pluto was also entering 0° Aries (1822). We often see major transitions in the financial 
system as Pluto changes signs—especially at 0° of the cardinal signs. For example, when Pluto 
entered 0° Libra (the opposing sign to Aries) some 152 years later, Nixon officially ended the U.S. 
dollar’s peg to gold in 1971. 
Saturn returned to Aries in 1849–52, in the uneasy calm after the revolutions of 1848 (with Ura-
nus and Pluto also in Aries, more than 50 European nations erupted into revolution). The dream of 
social equality had been quelled, but the machine age had begun. The California Gold Rush, peaking 
in 1849, injected vast liquidity into the global economy. The Compromise of 1850 admitted Califor-
nia to the Union, marrying conquest and commerce. In Europe, as the triple conjunction of Saturn, 
Uranus, and Pluto took place as all three planets were leaving Aries, the Great Exhibition of 1851 at 
London’s Crystal Palace displayed the industrial triumphs of the era: steam, iron, glass, and the logic 
of mass production. Yet behind the spectacle (Aries) lurked instability (Saturn in detriment). Karl 
Marx wrote in exile of the coming crises of overproduction. Louis-Napoléon’s coup of 1851 turned 
France’s Second Republic into an empire, revealing how swiftly economic anxiety (Saturn in detri-
ment) could be harnessed by authoritarian ambition (Aries). Saturn in Aries, ever the builder through 
destruction, oversaw a world re-engineering itself through technology and control.
By 1878–81, those engines had multiplied. The Second Industrial Revolution was accelerating: 
Edison’s light bulb (1879) and Bell’s telephone turned communication and industry into twin pillars 
of a new economy. At the same moment, the Long Depression of the 1870s forced nations onto the 
discipline (Saturn) of the gold standard (Aries)—a Saturnian straitjacket promising stability at the 
cost of flexibility—as the United States resumed gold convertibility. The Congress of Berlin in 1878 
redrew the Balkans but also signaled the onset of economic imperialism: Africa carved into colonies, 
resources flowing outward, profits upward. By the 1950s, somewhere between 50% and 70% of the 
world’s gold reserves are thought to have originated from Africa! A quick look at world gold reserves 
over this period gives a clear indication of where those profits went. This reflects the bullying nature 
of Saturn in Aries, where nations take what is not theirs by force and call it confiscation. We are 
seeing a similar form of confiscation today in relation to cryptocurrencies—most official national 
reserves of these assets have been built through seizure. We are also seeing European nations fund 
Ukraine’s war efforts through confiscated Russian funds that were frozen in European banks. The 
brief Boer rebellion of 1881 and the assassination of Russia’s reformist tsar, Alexander II, the same 
year showed the tension between freedom (Aries) and order (Saturn) once again snapping. Techno-
logical light had come, but its shadows lengthened into imperial greed and revolutionary violence.

When Saturn entered Aries in 1908, the fault lines of the old empires were already trembling. 
Within three years, the Ottoman, Chinese, and Mexican revolutions erupted, each toppling an 
exhausted order and resetting economic life. The Young Turks reopened the Ottoman parliament and 
sought industrial reform; in China, Sun Yat-sen’s revolution ended two millennia of dynastic rule, 
launching a turbulent republic; in Mexico, the revolt against Porfirio Díaz’s dictatorship was both 
social and agrarian—a struggle over land and labor that would shape Latin America for decades. In 
each case, economic modernization had outpaced political reform, and Saturn’s transit forced align-
ment through crisis. Meanwhile, in 1908, Ford’s Model T began production: the machine that would 
define 20th-century mass consumption. A new economy was born as old empires died, the archetypal 
marriage of Aries innovation and Saturnian structure. The Panic of 1907, which had paralyzed global 
finance, led to the founding of the Federal Reserve (1913) to provide a central lender of last resort, as 
Pluto entered 0° Cancer. It would go on to implement this role most notably during Pluto’s ingress at 
0° Capricorn during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–09.
The transit of 1937–40 brought the reckoning to its harshest form. The global economy, recover-
ing from the Great Depression, was militarized almost overnight. Hitler’s rearmament, Roosevelt’s 
mobilization of industry, and Japan’s invasion of China all turned factories (Saturn) into arsenals 
(Aries). The fiscal and moral discipline of Saturn fused with Aries’ appetite for conquest. In Sep-
tember 1939, as Saturn still stood in the Ram’s sign, the invasion of Poland ignited World War II. 
Economically, it ended unemployment and revived production; spiritually, it exposed the abyss that 
opens when structure serves destruction. Yet even here, renewal waited. By the time Saturn left Aries 
in 1940, the blueprints of the postwar order—from Keynesian economics to the dream of the United 
Nations—were already germinating beneath the rubble. During this transit, the Roosevelt Recession 
caused U.S. equities to crash nearly 50% before stabilizing in 1938. Gold, officially fixed at $35/
oz, was hoarded globally as central banks used it as the backbone of wartime finance. This resulted 
in one of the most important transfers of wealth, as the U.S. gold reserves rose from 28% to 30% of 
estimated global gold reserves in 1933 to 75% of global gold reserves after World War II.
By 1967–69, Saturn in Aries took form not on the battlefield but in the marketplace of ideas. 
The postwar boom reached its apogee. Inflation stirred, unions demanded reform, and a global youth 
culture (Aries) challenged the hierarchies (Saturn) that had delivered prosperity without justice. The 
year 1968 became the archetype: students in Paris and workers in Detroit, reformers in Prague and 
civil rights marchers in Memphis all confronted the structures of authority (Saturn) with boldness 
(Aries). Economically, the system was creaking under its own success. The Bretton Woods gold–dol-
lar link, the foundation of postwar finance, began to strain; by the early 1970s it would snap. The 
London Gold Pool collapsed (1968) after unsustainable U.S. gold outflows. This resulted in gold 
being traded in the open market for the first time. Yet in the same years, the Apollo program culmi-
nated in the Moon landing—a feat of engineering discipline and visionary daring that epitomized 
Saturn in Aries at its noblest. The United States won the space race against Russia, but can it win the 
AI race against China? The first computers networked into ARPANET (the precursor to the modern 
internet) in 1969, quietly launching the digital era. From rebellion and technology alike arose a new 
economy of information.
When Saturn returned to Aries, from 1996 to 1999, the world seemed united under the creed 
of globalization. Markets were liberalized, borders opened, and the internet wired the planet into 
a single nervous system. This was the high noon of neoliberal faith: productivity surging, inflation 
subdued, prosperity seemingly endless. Yet beneath the optimism lay the familiar pattern. The Asian 

## Page 66

financial crisis of 1997 tore through currencies and banks, revealing the fragility of deregulated capi-
tal. Russia’s default in 1998 echoed the debt collapses of earlier centuries. The World Trade Organi-
zation’s meeting in Seattle at the end of 1999 was besieged by protesters demanding accountability 
and equity—the collective Saturnian backlash against Aries’ reckless expansion. The euro’s launch in 
January 1999 symbolized both audacity and constraint: nations surrendering sovereignty (Aries) for 
stability (Saturn), a fusion of independence and structure that only Saturn in Aries could inspire. It is 
worth noting that the euro will soon be having its first Saturn return, a time of accountability when its 
structure and trust will be tested. Will the fiscal discipline and cohesion of the Eurozone hold?
As Saturn once more crossed the vernal point in 2025, the world confronted a similar paradox. 
The digital and financial revolutions of the past three decades have created prosperity of scale unseen 
in history—and inequality and debt to match. Artificial intelligence promises both liberation (Aries) 
and unemployment (Saturn in detriment). Markets have become planetary abstractions, detached 
from the real economies of Earth and labor. Debt levels exceed comprehension; the climate itself 
registers humanity’s overdraft. The archetypal question returns: can we build a new order before 
the old one collapses of its own contradictions? Saturn in Aries will test the resilience of monetary 
and political institutions, as earlier cycles tested empires. Economic restructuring seems inevitable, 
perhaps through new currencies, digital or decentralized; perhaps through the reindustrialization and 
new economic alliances as demanded by supply-chain fragility; perhaps through the moral account-
ing of environmental cost.
Patterns suggest that fiscal crises and technological leaps often coincide under this sky. As in 
1763, when imperial debts remade taxation; as in 1879, when the gold standard restored order after 
chaos; as in 1997, when the Asian contagion redrew financial discipline—so between 2025 and 2028 
we may expect the excesses of the previous era to meet their reckoning. Interest rates, inflation, and 
the social contract between capital and labor are all subject to revision. Yet out of constraint arises 
invention. Could we see digital or commodity-backed monetary reform, echoing past gold standard 
realignments? The same energies could yield breakthroughs in energy production, fusion, storage, or 
solar infrastructure, or new regulatory frameworks for AI and digital finance. Saturn in Aries insists 
on practical pioneering: bold beginnings anchored in responsibility.
Culturally, this transit often coincides with generational assertion. Youth movements in 1820, 
1848, 1968, and 1999 all bore its signature. In the mid-2020s, the generation born after the millen-
nium reaches political maturity. Their priorities—climate repair, equity, mental health, and techno-
logical ethics—may drive the next reformation. Their ideological stance around freedom in Palestine 
is very different from that of the leading institutions.
 Economically, this could manifest as a redefinition of value itself: away from extraction and 
speculation, toward sustainability and purpose. Just as the industrial world once learned to harness 
steam, and the digital world to harness code, humanity now must learn to harness consciousness—to 
direct innovation toward sustainable survival rather than speed. Prior cycles have shown that stock 
markets reach a mature or speculative high just before or early in the transit, then undergo correction 
or structural reform. We are late in the 18-year cycle, and I would expect the bubble (Aries) to burst 
(Saturn) during this transit.
The financial world, too, stands at a crossroads. Central banks face the dilemma of stabilizing 
inflation without stifling growth; the global South demands a more just debt architecture; energy 
transitions require unprecedented investment. History suggests that Saturn in Aries favors decisive 

## Page 67

63
structural action: the establishment of new systems rather than patchwork reform. With Pluto having 
also changed signs, we are likely to see significant change in the world financial order by the end of 
this transit—perhaps an international agreement redefining carbon markets, a coordinated digital-
currency regime, a move away from the petrodollar, the rise of a new economic superpower (China) 
or bloc (BRICS), or a new social contract between automation and employment. Each would mirror 
earlier patterns—the Bretton Woods of the 1940s, the gold standard of the 1870s, the euro of the 
1990s—moments when discipline met initiative and forged a new economic order.
Yet Saturn’s lessons are never gentle. The crises that birth renewal demand are honesty and 
endurance. In 1939, humanity’s failure to restrain aggression led to war; in 1997, its failure to regu-
late capital led to collapse. The coming years will test whether we can integrate the impulsive inge-
nuity of Aries with Saturn’s long-term wisdom. If we chase innovation for its own sake, we risk 
another speculative bubble or environmental catastrophe. If those in power cling to obsolete political 
structures (Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, Venezuela, Myanmar, Sudan, Eritrea, Palestine), war 
will force the change. The balance lies in courage tempered by conscience.
Astronomically, each Saturn ingress into Aries has introduced an epochal theme: industrialization 
in the 1760s, revolution in the 1790s, electrification in the 1880s, and globalization in the 1990s. The 
2020s version may well be the dawn of the post-carbon, post-analog civilization—or perhaps what I 
have coined as the “Cognitive Revolution,” as we hurl toward a period of unprecedented growth, at 
unprecedented speed, with the aid of AI and quantum computing, solving conflict, disease and resolv-
ing global issues with power beyond the limits of the human mind. The planet’s slow march reminds 
us that foundations take time, and that true beginnings require endings. Yet I have a feeling that we 
are going to need a seatbelt, for there is about to be a significant change in speed and projection.
In summary, these are the key recurring patterns that I have been able to identify from studying 
the last ten transits of Saturn through Aries. Beneath the overarching undertone set by Pluto, then 
Neptune, and Uranus, these themes are the lower octaves through which mundane activity will mani-
fest over the next three years:
•	
Crisis that restructures the world order: war, revolution, or diplomacy resulting in the end 
of the status quo and the painful birth of a new international configuration.
•	
Surge in revolutionary and nationalist movements: waves of popular uprisings, revolu-
tions, and surging nationalist sentiment; peoples asserting new identities or rights and rebel-
ling against entrenched authority.
•	
Technological and economic turning points: technological breakthroughs and shifts in the 
economic structure that transform society.
•	
Authoritarian backlash and power centralization: harsh authoritarian responses or power 
consolidations (Napoleon III after 1848, Putin’s consolidation of power in 1999, etc.).
•	
Ideological birth and cultural shift: emergence of new ideologies or cultural movements 
that leave a deep mark (Voltaire, Marx, the Women’s Liberation Movement, the Taliban, and 
Al-Qaeda).
•	
The old order reaching a breaking point and the new order struggling to be born: often 
amid conflict, the fall of kings and the rise of new leaders.

•	
Major market inflection point: there is a very high correlation with the four-year stock 
market trough forming during or shortly before (a couple of months) this transit. Therefore, 
it is a period marked by contraction, which tends to coincide with revaluations of the role 
of gold, whether symbolic (in its value) or structural (as an anchor for the global financial 
system).

 JUPITER IN LEO: THE HEART OF POWER
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
Jupiter in Leo, the expansive king in the sign of the solar king, moves in a twelve-year rhythm, 
and with each pass it casts humanity into a grand drama. When Jupiter—largest of planets and benev-
olent Zeus of old—journeys through fiery Leo, life imitates myth: courage and optimism swell, egos 
and faith burn bright, and creative fervor shakes the world stage with progress. In classical astrol-
ogy, Jupiter signifies wisdom, abundance, and moral law; Leo, ruled by the Sun, embodies royalty, 
pride, exuberance, luxury, and the childlike flame of creativity and pleasure. Together they form the 
archetype of the philosopher king—the magnanimous lion—leadership that is decisive, theatrical, 
and often accompanied by hubris. Jupiter will enter Leo on June 30, 2026, and remain there until July 
26, 2027. 
To understand what this period has in store for us, let’s look back at Jupiter’s last ten passages 
through Leo, how they coincided with eras of renaissance and reckoning, and how markets, particu-
larly the metal of Leo, Gold, flared and faltered alongside the pageant of history. 
Jupiter magnifies the influence of the sign it transits, and as you will see, prior passages through 
Leo have all brought about the rise (Jupiter) to power (Leo) of new empires, kings, religious lead-
ers, statesmen, and cultural icons—all resilient in Leo’s principle of self-determination. As a con-
sequence, this often leads to conflict and turmoil, which in turn impact the markets. Yet it is not 
just the sign being transited that is affected, as each sign sits on an axis and influences the opposing 
sign and even portions of the signs at 90° to it. Thus, we see recurring themes of the Leo–Aquarius 
axis: individual radiance–collective vision, love–humanity, passion–compassion, wealth–equality, 
sovereignty–solidarity, recognition–contribution, heart–mind, arrogance–detachment, hubris–revo-
lution, dogma–fanaticism. This helps explain the connection between Gold (Leo) and cryptocurren-
cies (Aquarius) as an axis for stores of value, with Gold having long anchored the Taurus–Scorpio 
financial axis and cryptocurrencies perhaps destined to do so in the future. In much the same way that 
the father–mother polarity (fourth and tenth houses) sustains the self (first house), or that one’s home 
and vocation (fourth and tenth houses) provide the foundation for the marital partnership (first and 
seventh houses), these twin instruments of wealth mirror the ancient balance between possession and 
power, matter and transformation.
From 1907 to 1908, Jupiter in Leo oversaw the world on the brink of modern transformation. 
That August, the British and Russian Empires set aside a century of rivalry to sign their convention 
in St. Petersburg, helping form the Triple Entente. It felt as though the great powers, under Jupiter’s 
auspices, were lifting their gaze toward a wider balance. Yet the age of imperial showmen and rob-
ber barons had not dimmed. In October 1907, a panic on Wall Street threatened systemic collapse 
(the DJIA fell 48.5% to a 4-year cycle trough) until J. P. Morgan (born under Jupiter in Leo), as if a 
mortal stand-in for Jupiter, personally orchestrated a $25 million rescue fund. Gold underpinned the 
system, its price fixed, but the run on reserves revealed how demand for the metal rises during this 
transit. Even as bankers played savior, the future was wheeling in. Henry Ford (a Leo native) rolled 
out the Model T in 1908—mass mobility made manifest—while the Young Turk Revolution pushed 
the Ottoman Empire toward constitutional reform. Something was gathering: alliances, technologies, 

## Page 70

66
and new ideals and ideas. (In 1907, Albert Einstein had his “happiest thought,” which led to the 
theory of general relativity.) Jupiter in Leo smiled on the bravado, even as it warned that light without 
discipline burns.
From 1919 to 1920, the planet returned to Leo as the world labored to heal from the Great War. 
Statesmen redrew maps and promised “never again.” The Treaty of Versailles aimed to seal peace, 
and the League of Nations opened in January 1920 as a forum for concord. Jupiter’s optimism shone 
through Leo’s regal posture—vision, dignity, the wish to lead nobly. Yet the lion’s shadow—ego and 
humiliation—was sown in punitive terms that would fester in Germany. There was a change of power 
and leadership (Leo); the democratic Weimar Republic was established as the Kaiser abdicated. We 
also witnessed the passing of the torch: old empires and dynasties were gone or dying (the Habsburgs, 
Romanovs, and Ottomans all fell by 1918), and new leaders stepped forward. Colossal figures who 
shone brightly in history and evoked a sense of national pride and power included Kemal Atatürk in 
Turkey, Saad Zaghloul in Egypt (leading the 1919 protests), and Mohandas Gandhi in India, who in 
1920 launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, harnessing Indian pride against British rule. Iran’s 
Reza Khan was also rising to power and would soon lead a coup d’état, seizing control from the Qajar 
dynasty in 1921. Under the League of Nations mandate, the Middle East was carved up among the 
European victors, marking this region as a repeating theme in all future Jupiter-in-Leo transits. At the 
same time, Jupiter’s justice widened. In August 1920, American women won the vote after genera-
tions of struggle—the lioness at last heard under the 19th Amendment. Markets swelled with postwar 
speculation as the crest of the 4-year cycle formed in November 1919. Inflation skittered, and curren-
cies strained against their anchors. As a result of World War I, the United States became the world’s 
dominant holder of Gold, as its reserves rose from 25% (prewar) to 40%.
From 1931 to 1932, the world lay in darkness. The Great Depression had shattered confidence, 
and from the high of 1929 to 1932, equities fell to a fraction of their former worth. The DJIA declined 
89.5% as the trough of the 72-year cycles formed. Jupiter in Leo amplifies whatever it touches—light 
and shadow alike—and here it magnified the extremes. In politics, the stage was set for dramatic 
leadership changes. In the United States, the 1932 election swept Franklin D. Roosevelt into office 
with a promise of bold, persistent experimentation—Leo-like courage tempered by care—in the New 
Deal. In Germany, economic ruin stoked national pride as Hitler’s Nazi Party rose to power in the 
Reichstag. In Asia, Imperial Japan invaded China; in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was born; and in 
Iraq, King Faisal died and his son Ghazi took the throne (a theme that may repeat in Saudi Arabia dur-
ing this transit). Gold, the Sun’s metal, was dragged into the storm. In September 1931, Britain aban-
doned the gold standard, currencies devalued, bullion surged, and the old monetary order cracked. 
It was as if the world’s gold had to melt so a new shape could be poured. Even then, Jupiter’s gift 
persisted. In labs and studios, breakthroughs glimmered. James Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron 
in 1932 lit the heart of matter—proof that in the deepest night, a spark remains. 
From 1943 to 1944, the world was ablaze, and Jupiter in Leo presided over a pivot. Markets, sub-
dued by years of fear, began to rise as victory seemed within reach. In June 1944, D-Day embodied 
the transit’s courage and gamble alike, as millions acted as one in a hazardous leap toward liberation. 
At the same time, on the hillsides of New Hampshire, delegates drafted a new financial architecture. 
The Bretton Woods Agreement yoked the U.S. Dollar to gold as the financial torch of power passed 
from sterling to the United States. By the end of World War II, U.S. gold holdings accounted for 75% 
of global reserves. The aim was Jupiterian: to wed wisdom and generosity, to make prosperity share-
able and chaos less likely through the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary

Fund. This period encapsulated Leo’s motifs of victory, pride, and noble cause, led by the “Big 
Three” shaping history at the Tehran (a Leo city) Conference. During this period, the first program-
mable computer was built in Britain, and the first long-range guided missiles were developed in Ger-
many. In fact, it was the German brain drain that would go on to ignite the space race after the war. 
In the Middle East, Lebanon achieved independence from France (a Leo country), tensions between 
Jewish and Arab communities began to intensify in Palestine, and—most significantly—the Anglo-
American Petroleum Agreement was signed, as the new empire assumed the mantle from the old.
From 1955 to 1956, the transit brought drama of a different kind. In the United States, the civil 
rights movement broke into global consciousness (Sun) in August 1955 with a Leo stellium trig-
gered by the shocking (Uranus) and brutal (Mars) lynching (Pluto) of an innocent (Venus) child 
(Leo), Emmett Till. This was the year when Rosa Parks sat and the Montgomery Bus Boycott stood. 
A young Martin Luther King Jr. emerged, preaching nonviolence as Gandhi had during the 1920 
transit of Jupiter through Leo. Jupiter’s principle of moral law fused with Leo’s ardor. Rock ’n’ roll 
exploded, and Elvis became a national phenomenon. Creative fire tore through old barriers and lit a 
generation’s voice. Abroad, Hungary revolted against Soviet rule, and in Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser 
(born under a Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Leo) nationalized (Saturn) the Suez Canal (Neptune) 
and confronted imperial (Jupiter) pride (Leo). Markets were rising high in a postwar boom. Beneath 
the glow, fine cracks formed. The crest of the 4-year cycle formed in the equity markets (DJIA) 
during this period, followed by a 20.6% correction into the trough of the 4-year cycle in 1957. Dis-
neyland opened in California to great fanfare, heralding a new era of themed entertainment—Walt 
Disney’s vision realized. (Interestingly, Disney died in late 1966 under the next Leo cycle.) In sci-
ence, antimatter was first produced as Jupiter formed a conjunction with Pluto on the royal fixed star 
Regulus. During this transit, the Leo nation of France lost yet more colonies as Morocco and Tunisia 
gained independence.
From 1966 to 1968, the world was a furnace. Youth revolted, culture reinvented itself, and the 
street became a stage. The Summer of Love gathered tens of thousands into a temporary city of music 
and peace. By 1968, ideals ignited global protests from Paris (a Leo city) to Prague to Mexico City, 
alongside American tragedies (the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. 
Kennedy) and the grinding war in Vietnam. Jupiter made the personal political, and Leo made self-
expression a public rite. The period’s financial temperature rose, too, as U.S. equities formed another 
crest in the 4-year cycle in early 1966 and then fell sharply—a 26.5% decline in the DJIA—into the 
trough of that same cycle. The Dollar-to-Gold link strained as deficits mounted and reserves bled to 
defend the $35-per-ounce peg. The Sun’s metal began slipping from its altar, foreshadowing the end 
of convertibility a few years later. In March 1968, with Jupiter on Regulus (the heart of the Lion at 
29° Leo), the London Gold Pool collapsed—the first step toward a free-market pricing mechanism 
for Gold. Few moments in history reflect the grandeur of Jupiter in Leo more vividly than the day 
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, ascended the Peacock Throne and was crowned King of 
Kings in a lavish ceremony steeped in centuries of imperial tradition. While Jupiter had just left Leo, 
it remained within orb of Regulus. This was also a period of breathtaking innovation. The first human 
heart (Leo) transplant was performed, and the Apollo program prepared to circle the Moon. Earth-
rise, photographed just after Jupiter left Leo, offered the most Leonine image of all: our luminous 
home, fragile and whole. During this transit, the map of the Middle East was redrawn once again by 
the Six-Day War, as the Lion of Judah occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai, and the 
Golan Heights. Farther east, Mao Zedong launched the Chinese Cultural Revolution as he empow-
ered the militant youth, the Red Guards.
