Later in the fall, Mars will enter the fire sign of Leo and form an opposition to Pluto. This con-
figuration is indicative of aggressive action and an intensification of power struggles. The explosive 
signature suggests that the leadership (Mars in Leo) is facing pressure from external or institutional 
forces (Pluto in the tenth house). Pluto also rules debt, so perhaps there is a power struggle involving 
the Federal Reserve Board.
The most prominent planetary placement is that of Chiron on the ascendant. This is suggestive 
of the national wound or injury on display. It is a sign that the nation will be suffering and learning 
an important lesson. In the final degree of Aries, Chiron’s position is suggestive of symbolic endings, 
crises, and an irreversible transition in the status quo. The wound is self-inflicted, as Chiron and the 
ascendant are in square aspect to Mars, the ruler of the chart. Errors of judgment, past aggressive 
policies, or mismanagement now come home to roost. The dynamics involved are suggestive of a 
leadership or national identity crisis linked to national pride, reputation, or security. Could it be the 
economic consequence of “Liberation Day”? Is the nation responding to the dangerous aspects dis-
cussed in the Summer Ingress section? It could also be an intensification of geopolitical confrontation 
and war, or a crisis brought about by revelations concerning morality and secrets (the Epstein files?). 
It may also be a sign of another pandemic.
The Sun, representing President Trump, is always in its fall on the autumn ingress. However, 
in this chart it is weakly positioned in the sixth house of injury, wounds, enemies, service, labor, 
health, war, and the military. The Sun (leader) is opposed by Neptune (lord of the twelfth house and 
positioned there), suggestive of hidden enemies, confusion, disillusionment, deception, or military 
operations. This echoes earlier Saturn–Neptune themes that have been in force since 2025 but have 
now turned toxic (twelfth house)—the illusory result being some type of collapse or loss. Saturn (lord 
of the tenth house) nearby reinforces fatigue, decay, and limitation; the administration is under siege, 
institutions are strained, and morale is low. With the Sun in the sixth house and the Saturn–Neptune 
conjunction in play, this configuration may point to another public health or environmental crisis.

The autumn of 2026 unfolds beneath the long and solemn shadow of Chiron, the wounded healer. 
Its presence marks this season as one of revelation and reckoning, where the nation is asked to con-
front pain not as punishment but as a teacher. Old wounds (political, social, and economic) rise to the 
surface, seeking acknowledgment and understanding, as they can no longer be denied. The impulse 
to defend and assert remains strong (Aries rising, Mars in Cancer), yet power itself feels burdened, 
its confidence tempered by memory and consequence (Mars opposing Pluto). Leadership wavers 
between conviction and confusion (Sun opposing Neptune and Saturn), while the public wrestles 
with faith and fatigue, longing for truth amid the noise of pride and promise (Moon opposing Jupi-
ter). Under Chiron’s shadow, this is not merely a time of struggle but an important lesson required 
for healing. The beacon of hope (Moon in the eleventh house) rises from the people, not the halls of 
power. In their unity and resilience rests the nation’s true fortune—the living proof that in its trials, it 
is the great heart of the American public that will lead the nation to heal (Jupiter in Leo).
The ingress chart has Mercury approaching the descendant. Mercury is a planet of high winds, 
and with the Sun forming a kite pattern, there is a risk of hurricanes and destructive storms.
Looking at the astrocartography map, Europe really stands out during this ingress. London has a 
grand cross on its ingress chart, with the Sun on the Nadir (IC), Neptune on the MC, Pluto on the descen-
dant, and Mars on the ascendant. This is bound to be an important period in the history of the United 
Kingdom. The Mars–Pluto lines run across central Europe, with Saturn on the MC. As we move toward 
Eastern Europe, Ukraine finds Chiron on the MC—the symbolic wound of Europe and the free world. 
The most important outer planetary configuration will be the Mars–Pluto opposition, with Pluto 
on the MC over the United States and on the IC over China. Could this be pointing to a crest in the 
NASDAQ?
SPECIFIC PERIODS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE FALL
In general, we tend to see a seasonal correction in financial markets following the autumn ingress. 
An important double retrograde is taking place, involving Venus and Mercury in the sign of Scorpio, 
which we analyzed in depth in the retrograde section of this book. The first period that could result in 
a sudden reversal in the markets is therefore October 2–4, as Venus begins its retrograde, Mars forms 
an opposition to Pluto, and the Sun opposes Saturn. These signatures are aggressive and suggest a 
shock or sudden event disrupting the markets.
Pluto, the ruler of Scorpio, is active throughout October and November. Pluto stations direct on 
October 15, and Venus goes on to form a square to Pluto as Mercury turns retrograde in Scorpio on 
October 24. This is a month traditionally associated with Halloween, and market psychology will 
be on edge and prone to fear. This unease may spill over into geopolitics, as many important acts of 
aggression have taken place during transits of Scorpio. 
November 3 (+/− one week) is an important date, as Mars transits 20° Leo, the same degree acti-
vated by the August 12 eclipse. Mars tends to act as a trigger, releasing stored eclipse energy. Western 
Europe is a potential focal point for significant events. Since the subsolar point lies over Iceland, 
this raises concern about volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or tsunamis in the Arctic Ocean—or acts 
of aggression involving Greenland. This signature coincides with the midterm elections (November 
3) and could correlate with acts of forced assertion, as Mars in Leo is suggestive of ego-driven arro-
gance. Alternatively, it could indicate a war signature—used as a distraction or a unifying force.

Both Venus and Mercury end their respective retrogrades on November 13. This will be followed 
by Mars conjunct Jupiter, the Sun square Jupiter, and the Sun square Mars from November 16 to 19. 
As such, the period of November 13–19 is bound to be extremely important for the financial markets 
and will likely mark a critical reversal period. In 2025, Venus and Mercury ended their retrogrades 
five days apart, April 7–12. Most markets formed an important trough during that time, driven by the 
panic that followed Trump’s tariff announcement. Could the events of November 2026 be an echo of 
April 2025?
The Sun will oppose Uranus on November 25. We often see public protests, sudden shocking 
events, resignations, scandals, or rebellions under this influence. This could be a period marked by 
erratic news. By December 4, Mars will form a square aspect to Uranus, which is a far more aggres-
sive expression. In 2025, Israel launched its surprise attack on Iran under this signature, commencing 
the 12-day war. This is the aspect of sudden (Uranus) force (Mars), rebellion, rupture, and accidents. 
Events may erupt without warning and break whatever has become too rigid or repressed. In mun-
dane astrology, this configuration almost always coincides with periods of violent unrest, military 
tension, technological accidents, or explosive political developments.
Critical reversal dates for fall: The following are geocosmic critical reversal dates for financial 
markets during this season. Any market making a two-week or greater high or low can be considered 
a candidate for a reversal within +/− three trading days. The steepness of the reversal depends on 
where each market is in its primary cycle. If it is within the time band for its primary-cycle crest or 
trough, the reversal will be steepest. If it is due for its one-third or half-cycle phase, the reversal will 
be less steep. If none of these apply, the reversal is probably not worth trading.
October 9–12
November 13–16
November 20–23
December 7
December 19–21
In conclusion, the coming year can be summarized as follows:
•	
Winter 2025–26: The illusion of financial solidity begins to erode as cracks start to surface.
•	
Spring 2026: A bold assertion of executive power, legislative breakdowns, and strain with 
allies. The illusion of prosperity and strength built on weak foundations (Saturn–Neptune) 
begins to fracture.
•	
Summer 2026: The United States projects confidence through the America250 celebrations 
and media spectacle, but the Mars–Uranus conjunction warns of hidden enemies and poten-
tial shocks.
•	
Autumn 2026: A period of confrontation and reckoning as hidden tensions erupt. As the 
mask slips, the crisis unfolds.

 2026 GEOCOSMIC EPHEMERIS AND ASTRO CALENDAR GUIDE
On the following pages you will find the Geocosmic ephemeris (on the left-hand pages) and the 
Astrological Calendar Guide (on the right-hand pages), for each month between January 2026 and 
April 2027.
The ephemeris is provided by Astro Computing Services (ACS) of Epping, New Hampshire. 
The page is divided into 4 sections. The top section lists the planetary positions as of midnight, GMT 
(Greenwich Mean Time). The middle section gives the positions of the declinations and latitudes of 
each planet for each day, as of midnight GMT. The right of this section, and a little lower, are the 
Moon phenomena. Of most importance are the two right columns, titled “Void of Course Moon” 
(symbol for the Moon). The farthest right-hand column gives the Moon Ingress, which lists the times 
when the Moon enters each sign of the zodiac, basis GMT. This is especially important for traders 
who trade the Solar-Lunar cycles, as I do, and as outlined in The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Tim-
ing Volume 4: Solar-Lunar Correlations to Short-Term Reversals and The Sun, The Moon, and The 
Silver Market: Secrets of a Silver Trader. The bottom part of the page shows the “Daily Aspectarian,” 
which lists the exact time that aspects form between any two planets (including the Sun and Moon). 
These are important in identifying “Geocosmic Critical Reversal Dates” in the MMA Monthly Cycles 
Report, as well as this Forecast 2026 book.
The right-hand page is a day-by-day calendar, showing the times that each aspect and planetary 
ingress takes place. The times in the calendar have been adjusted for the EST (Eastern Standard 
Time) zone. It is not adjusted for daylight savings time. Here too one can instantly see if any particu-
lar day has more than, or less than, the usual amount of geocosmic activity going on. One can also see 
when planetary aspects are occurring close in time to one another, which is the basis for identifying 
a “Critical Reversal Date,” as described in The Ultimate Book on Stock Market Timing, Volume 3: 
Geocosmic Correlations to Trading Cycles.
