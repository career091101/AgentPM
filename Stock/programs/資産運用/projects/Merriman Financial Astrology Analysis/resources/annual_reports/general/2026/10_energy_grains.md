months. Allowing a normal range of 1/6 of the median cycle length would suggest a 4-year cycle 
with an orb of eight months. Measured from November 21, 2022, the next 4-year cycle would be 
due November 2026 +/– 8 months, or March 2026 to July 2027. If it happens in the 47–51 month 
intervals of the first three cases, it would next be due October 2026 to February 2027.
Cycles usually subdivide into phases that are either 1/2 or 1/3 the length of the greater cycle. In 
many cases, both a 2- and 3-phase cycle may be present in the greater cycle, forming a “combina-
tion” pattern. The current 4-year BTC cycle is unfolding in a combination pattern, with lows at both 
the ½ and 1/3 intervals. Thus, we see both a 16-month and a 24-month sub-cycle within the greater 
4-year cycle.
The first 24-month half-cycle occurred on August 5, 2024, at 49,445. It was 21 months following 
the 4-year cycle on November 21, 2022. With a range of four months, it is next due between April 2026 
and December 2026. Note that it will overlap the 4-year cycle which is also due during this time.
Two of the three-phase sub-cycles have also taken place, on January 23, 2024, and April 7, 2025. 
The third one will coincide with the 4-year cycle. With a range of 13–19 months, it is ideally due 
from May to November 2026, again overlapping with the 4-year cycle, as well as the next 24-month 
cycle. In fact, if the 4-year cycle again unfolds at the 47–51-month interval, all of these cycles would 
overlap October to November 2026. With such a short history in BTC, however, it might be wise to 
consider the orb to be a bit wider.
Lately, BTC has also been exhibiting an 8–13 month cycle. There could be two of these within 
the 16-month cycle, and in some cases, it may even coincide with the 16-month cycle if it happens 
in a 13-month period. Within the 24-month cycle, it could unfold two or three times. If this sub-cycle 
is valid, then April 7, 2025, started its second phase of the 24-month cycle, and first phase of the 
16-month cycle. Its next low is thus due December 2025 to May 2026. The one after that would 
coincide with three longer cycles: the 16-month, 24-month, and 4-year cycles. 
PRICE TARGETS
When several cycles converge to bottom simultaneously, then the magnitude of the decline is 
typically steep. It is magnified over what would be expected for a low in the shorter-term cycles. 
Hence, my forecast is for a 70–90% decline from the all-time high of 2025 to the 4-year cycle low 
due in late 2026. It is consistent with the declines from the three prior 4-year cycle highs to lows. In 
other financial markets, such “crashes” are usually 77–93% selloffs from the cycle’s highs. Bitcoin 
has so far fallen into this category, too.
Short-term, the second 10.5-month cycle trough due December 2025–May 2026 has a measured 
price target of 100,335 +/– 6110, or 94,225–106,445. It’s already traded down to 90,000 as of this 
writing in early November 2025 and could be lower by the time the book comes out.  But that 10.5-
month low is due. 
If the longer–term 4-year cycle is to exert its dominance, however, BTC could fall further into its 
next 10.5-month cycle trough. A break below the 16-month moving average (MA) would be the first 
signal. That MA is around 94,000 as this is being written, which is also near the low end of the down-
side price target given above. A break below the 24-month MA, around 82,000 as of mid-November, 
would be a stronger indication that the 4-year cycle has topped out. If these levels are broken, then 
the 4-year cycle crest is in, and a 77–93% decline would give a downside price target of 8835–29,050 

## Page 158

154
for the 4-year cycle trough, due late 2026. However, it should also be pointed out that no 4-year cycle 
bottom has yet to break below a previous 4-year cycle crest. The last confirmed 4-year cycle crest was 
68,999 in November 2021. Measured off the high of 2025, that would represent a decline of 45%, far 
short of declines to previous 4-year cycle troughs of over 78%.
Until major support at 75,000–85,000 is broken, however, the bullish case cannot be completely 
dismissed. The last 10.5-month cycle low in April was 74,445. Technically, BTC is not confirmed 
bearish by MMA methodology until it closes below there, assuming there is not a new high first. If 
the market is to be bullish, and support holds above 75,000–85,000, then the next rally would make 
a new ATH. An estimate of that next high would be 145,000 +/– 900.
In the meantime, if the bearish phase of the 4-year cycle has started, then the rally to the crest of 
the next 10.5-month cycle would be corrective and not make a new all-time high. Resistance for such 
a corrective rally would normally be about 110,000 +/– 4000. But with Bitcoin, rallies (and declines) 
can exceed normal measurements. A rally back to 122,000–125,000 would create an interesting head 
and shoulders chart formation with a neckline around 90,000–95,000. Closing below that would put 
BTC on track for another leg down to 60,000–65,000. And it still wouldn’t be enough for the projec-
tion to the final 4-year cycle trough.
GEOCOSMIC CYCLES
Once again, there is just not enough history to conduct formal studies to identify high-frequency 
correlations between geocosmic cycles and cycles in Bitcoin prices. We can only speculate based on 
basic astrological principles as they might relate to new digital currencies. The assumption is that 
Uranus will be a key geocosmic factor, for it is associated with newness, disruption, and sudden 
changes. Given that world currencies are in a transition phase, moving from paper currencies, backed 
by goodwill and faith of various world governments, to a decentralized digital means of exchange, 
the principles of Uranus appear to apply. And that brings us back to the observation of Uranus as 
an indicator of boom-bust behavior related to the sectors of the economy associated with the sign it 
transits through. 

## Page 159

155
Uranus spends approximately seven years in a sign. It crossed from Taurus into Gemini on July 
7, 2025, through November 8, 2025. It returned back to Taurus, where it remains until April 25, 2026, 
after which it will spend the next six years in Gemini. As Taurus rules money and currency, last year’s 
book suggested, “Bitcoin could experience another large decline nearby to the period when Uranus 
ingresses into Gemini, July 2025–April 2026.” Indeed, Bitcoin made its all-time high in this period 
so far, on October 6, 2025. Then, “This outlook assumes that Bitcoin will exhibit a boom/bust pat-
tern in both Taurus and Gemini. Why? Well, Taurus makes sense because it represents currencies, 
and Bitcoin is a digital currency. Gemini makes sense too, because Bitcoin relies on the blockchain 
technology, which plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transac-
tions in digital currencies. There are apt to be many new novel applications and innovations related 
to blockchain use, and this too can greatly affect the price of Bitcoin.” Thus, we expect Bitcoin to 
fall sharply into a 4-year cycle low in the early part of Uranus transiting Gemini, followed by another 
new all-time high within the next 2–4 years.
Last year’s book also focused on the Venus retrograde cycle. It stated, “Another geocosmic fac-
tor to consider is Venus retrograde, March 1–April 12. Since Venus rules currencies, and Bitcoin is 
a digital currency, a reversal from an intermediate-term–term cycle high could take place here. If 
Bitcoin continues its rally into 2025, we could see the crest of the 11- and 16-month cycles January–
March, and then the decline into the low of those cycles within two months of June 2025.” BTC did 
make an all-time high in January 2025, followed by a sharp 31.7% decline into April 7–9, which was 
within two months of June 2025, and while Venus was retrograde. Venus will next turn retrograde 
October 3–November 13, 2026, right in the period when we anticipate the 4-year cycle trough. 
CONCLUSIONS
My outlook on Bitcoin in 2026 is quite simple:
The 4-year cycle crest is in, as of October 2025.
Bitcoin is now in the process of a 73–93% decline into its 4-year cycle trough due April 2026–
August 2027, and especially October 2026–February 2027.
The price target for the low is 8835–29,050.
The outlook will be revised if BTC closes above 127,000.
Investors are advised to buy Bitcoin on a break below 30,000 after April 2026, and especially if 
it happens in October 2026–February 2027.

CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR BTC IN 2026
The critical reversal dates given below for Bitcoin are based on observations of strong reversals 
over the past couple of years. There is not enough history yet to determine if they will work consis-
tently in the future. Many of these reversal observations involved aspects of the Sun, Venus, and Mars 
to Uranus. Venus–Mars and Venus–Saturn aspects also appeared to be important reversal signatures. 
Allow a 3-day orb for potential reversals.

 CRUDE OIL IN 2026
by Pouyan Zolfagharnia, MMA Analyst
REVIEW
The water sign of Pisces is commonly associated with Crude Oil, which is ruled over by Neptune 
and Jupiter. The 2022 high for Crude Oil was 130.50 on March 7 and occurred while the Sun trans-
lated the Jupiter–Neptune conjunction in Pisces. This was a significant geocosmic signature relating 
to Crude Oil and may remain as the 12-year crest. Yet it is still early in the cycle, and for the time 
being, it remains as the 4-year crest.
Saturn, the planet of restrictions and contraction, was next to enter Pisces a year later, in March 
2023, and will remain there until February 13, 2026, shortly before the Saturn–Neptune conjunction 
a week later. Crude Oil fell to the 4-year trough in May 2023, a double bottom to the initial low of 
March as Saturn entered Pisces. We have seen numerous Saturnian ‘restrictions’ and ‘limits’ imposed 
on this market, from the price cap and sanctions on the sale of Russian Crude Oil to the Saudi pro-
duction cuts as OPEC+ tried to manage supply. Saturn’s impact can be seen directly on the prices of 
Crude Oil, which has been trapped under a steep trendline since the high of March 2022. 
In 2025, the Saturn–Neptune conjunction was within a 1° orb, and we saw the current 4-year 
cycle turn bearish by taking out the low that commenced the cycle. As we enter the new year and in 
the orb of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, we are seeing the 22-month moving average (MA) drop-
ping below the slower 72-month MA. With prices under the two MAs, this will downgrade the trend 
to bearish for the first time since the 2020 pandemic low.
As noted in Forecast 2025, “With Saturn exiting the sign of Pisces and entering the confronta-
tional sign of Aries. With numerous geocosmic signatures pointing to 2025–2026 as a period of tense 
geopolitical activity, it is worth mentioning that this asset is often used as a barometer for geopolitical

risk, translating it as higher Crude Prices.” During Saturn’s brief ingress into Aries between May and 
September 2025, we saw the breakout of the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. This sent Crude Oil 
rallying over 42%. I believe this was a prelude for further geopolitical turmoil that is likely to follow 
with Saturn’s entry into Aries over the next three years. If you refer to the chapter on Jupiter’s transit 
of Leo, you will see that the Middle East has experienced geopolitical instability and tension during 
each of these transits, including the Iraq wars of 1990 and 2003. During the 2003 transit, Mossad 
agents leaked information on the Iranian nuclear program. In the previous transit, we saw the Obama 
administration broker the Iranian nuclear deal. There is a pattern suggestive of tensions reaching a 
boiling point with Iran between June 2026 and July 2027.

THE 12-YEAR CYCLE IN CRUDE OIL AND ITS PHASES
The long-term cyclical analysis in Crude Oil begins with a potential 36-year cycle. The exact 
periodicity of this cycle is unknown because there haven’t been enough occurrences in Crude Oil to 
quantify it to a high degree of statistical probability. The previous 36-year cycle was from April 1986 
until April 2020, which was 34 years. 
The 36-year cycle can be subdivided into either two 18-year cycles with a range of 15–21 years, 
or three 12-year cycles with a range of 10–14 years. Historical analysis suggests that the 12-year 
cycle is more prominent. From the low of April 1986, the next 12-year trough was February of 1999, 
which was 12 years and 10 months. Following that, the next trough was January of 2009, which was 
9 years and 11 months. The final 12-year cycle was April 2020, which was 11 years and 3 months 
later. This means that the next 12-year cycle trough is due 2032 +/– 2 years.
As shown in the chart above, the 12-year cycle has a tendency to break down into three 4-year 
or 44-month cyclical phases, with a range of 36–52 months. Therefore, my preferred outlook is 
that the current 44-month cycle formed on May 4, 2023, at 63.64. The trough formed under the 
22-month MA and even tested the 72-month MA. The next 44-month cyclical trough is due Janu-
ary 2027 +/– 8 months. In January 2026, we will be commencing the 32nd month of the current 
44-month cycle, which has turned bearish by taking out the low that commenced the cycle in April 
of 2025.
There is also a chance that the current 12-year cycle is breaking down into a two-phased cycle of 6 
years (range of 5–7 years). This would mean that the 6-year cycle is due between 2025–2027, preferably 
with Saturn in Pisces and in orb of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction. This is my alternative outlook, but 
it deserves attention because a case can be made that a 6-year half cycle is breaking down further into 
two 3-year half-cycle phases with a range of 30–42 month, similar to the U.S. stock market cycle.

## Page 163

159
Under both scenarios, once the 44-month or 6-year trough has formed, I am expecting a strong 
rally back up to the descending trendline that is joining the July 2008 crest to the March 2022 one (in 
the region of 110–125). Since we are in a bullish 12-year cycle, having taken out the crest of the prior 
cycle, it is perfectly conceivable that Crude Oil may even break through the descending trendline and 
record a new ATH with a $130 +/– 15.35 rally from the 44-month or 6-year cycle trough. 
Whilst this asset has essentially remained dormant with the Saturn transit through Pisces over 
the past 3 years, investors should not take their eyes off Crude Oil’s potential for a significant rally. 
The fundamental picture is mixed; On one hand, an economic recession into 2027 would retain prices 
within the bearish price channel until the end of the 44-month or 6-year cycle. On the other hand, the 
risk of geopolitical tension with oil-producing nations (Russia, Iran, Venezuela, etc.), coupled with 
historical low levels of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, suggests that Crude Oil prices are coil-
ing and preparing to erupt. 
THE INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLES
The 44-month cycle, in turn, can either break down into two 22-month cycles or three 15-month 
cycles.
My preferred outlook for the intermediate cycle count is that we have had a two-phased 
44-month cycle, with the first 22-month cycle following from the April 2020 low, being December 
2021 at 62.43. The next 22-month cycle contracted to 17 months and culminated with a 44-month 
cycle in May 2023 at 63.64. The current 44-month cycle is also breaking down into two phases, 
with the first phase forming in April 2025 at 55.12. The price target for the 44-month trough is 
51.01 +/– 5.20 at any time between May 2026 and September 2027. This is my preferred outlook 
for the intermediate outlook.
As discussed above, the 12-year cycles may be unfolding in two 6-year phases. Whilst this break-
down is far less prominent, it has occurred in the past, so I am sharing it as an alternative outlook. 
This suggests the 6-year trough is due at any point between 2025 and 2027. It would also suggest that 
the 6-year cycle is either breaking down into three 24-month +/– 4 months phases or two 36-month 

## Page 164

160
+/– 6 months phases. If we are in a 6-year cycle, it would appear to have formed a 36-month half-
cycle phase in May 2023, 37 months into the cycle. In this scenario, January will commence the 32nd 
month of the second 36-month cycle, which has turned bearish. The price target for the 36-month 
trough is 28.17 +/– 7.89 at any time between November 2025 and November 2026. It’s possible it 
doesn’t fall that low, as a break below 55.12 would be a minimum target to meet the criterion.
GEOCOSMICS
As noted in Forecast 2025, “The important geocosmic events relating to Crude Oil during 2025 
will be the fact that Saturn will leave Pisces, and the ingress of both Saturn and Neptune over the 
vernal axis, which will take place numerous times during 2025 to 2026, going out with a bang at the 
Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20, 2026. With heavy and restrictive Saturnian energy lift-
ing as early as May 2025, we should see a rally in Crude Oil prices.” We got a preview of what is to 
come, between May and June 2025, with the Iran–Israel 12-day war, which sent Crude Oil rallying 
41.8%. It’s worth noting that Israel did not target any of the Iranian petroleum infrastructure during 
the attacks. However, Iran immediately threatened to block (Saturn) the Strait of Hormuz (Neptune), 
should the war escalate. These concerns remain heightened as we enter 2026.
The seasonal trend for Crude Oil is a slump as the Sun transits Sagittarius. As such, I am looking 
for a buying opportunity from late November to mid-December 2025. From here, I would expect a 
rally at least from late February into early March. For the time being, all rallies will be corrective in 
nature until we break through the descending trendline and bearish price channel in the weekly chart. 
If we see a strong weekly or monthly close above these resistance zones, we could see Crude Oil 
rally all the way into July 2026 +/–1 month. At this point, the Jupiter–Pluto opposition will be in full 
force. In prior instances, this signature has corresponded to crest formations within 3 months of the 
opposition that preceded a sharp sell-off. The high of June 2014 formed 2 months after the final Jupi-
ter–Pluto opposition of April 2014. Crude Oil went on to drop 75.8% in value from the crest. The time 
before that was the high of October 2000, which formed a month after the first passage of the Jupi-
ter–Pluto opposition of September 2000. Crude Oil went on to drop 53.7% in value from that crest.
Historical analysis of the Neptune cycle shows that this planet is inflationary when transiting fire 
signs or the vernal axis. There is also evidence of inflationary spikes occurring at the Saturn–Neptune 
conjunctions. We also have the disruptive planet, Uranus, transiting the transactive sign of Gemini, 
which was always expected to bring about trade disruptions. Whilst we are yet to see the full infla-
tionary impact of Trump’s trade wars, it is also worth noting that Crude Oil is one of the key com-
modities responsible for inflation. The last time Neptune went over the vernal axis was 1861, which 
corresponds to the highest value in WTI (when adjusted for inflation) during the American Civil War. 
Crude Oil tends to form important reversals in close proximity to the retrograde motion of Nep-
tune and Jupiter. Neptune will go retrograde on July 7, 2026, until December 12, 2026. Jupiter will go 
retrograde on November 11, 2025, and will be retrograde until March 10, 2026. It will start its next 
retrograde from December 12, 2026 (same day as Neptune) until April 12, 2027. 
CONCLUSION
Whilst the geocosmic outlook is tense, the cycle studies take precedence and remain bearish. The 
cycle studies dictate a bearish move down into the preferred 44-month trough (May 2026–September 
2027) or the alternative outlook of the 6-year trough (April 2025–April 2027). In the latter case, a 
three-year cycle would be due November 2025–November 2026. This overlap zone could be the hot

161
zone. The price action will help guide us as to which cycle is forming, since the price target for the 
44-month trough is 51.01 +/– 5.20, whilst the target for the 6-year trough may be the steeper decline 
to 28.17 +/– 7.89.
If the geopolitics flare up before either of these two troughs has formed, we are only going to see 
a corrective rally, which will be followed by a sharp move back down, as seen in 2025. However, if 
geopolitics is aligned with either the 44-month or 6-year low, we are likely to see a spectacular rally 
that has a good chance of recording a new ATH. I would expect this low to be accompanied by bullish 
oscillator divergence in the CCI of the weekly chart. Confirmation for the rally will be a weekly or 
monthly close above the descending trend lines shown in my charts.

 GRAIN MARKETS IN 2026
by Wyatt Fellows, MMA Analyst
REVIEW	
Last year’s Forecast 2025 book left off with: “The bottom line here is that with ample grain 
stocks heading into 2025, and the unknown outcomes of the next administration’s policies toward 
energy and trade, it will probably take a supply reduction event to significantly push grain prices 
higher in 2025. Just such an event is possible with the coming Saturn–Neptune conjunction, but its 
effect on the grain markets may not fully be felt until into 2026.” 
We did not get a major supply-reducing weather event last year, and President Trump decided to 
play another game of chicken with China on trade. This kept the grain markets largely range-bound 
but with a more downward bias in Corn and Wheat. On a positive note, all three major grains retested 
their August 2024 lows to some degree in 2025 and held. This is encouraging price action, and as we 
close out 2025, definite signs of life are emerging that could lead to some nice returns for this com-
plex after years of underperformance relative to other commodities and asset classes.
WEATHER
The main event for the grain markets in 2026 is the conjunction of Saturn (restriction) and Nep-
tune (water) taking place in the sign of Aries (fire) on February 20, 2026. In the past, significant 
highs in the grain markets occurred at the conjunctions and oppositions of these two outer planets, 
and mostly within 15 months of the exact aspect. These highs were usually a result of a significant 
drought taking place over a major grain-producing region of the world, which is a hallmark of Saturn 
in Aries (wildfires, eruptions, droughts). For Wheat, these areas would be China, India, and Russia. 
For Corn, it would be the United States, China, and Brazil. And for Soybeans, Brazil, the United 
States, and Argentina. Any widespread hot and dry conditions or lack of adequate rainfall in these 
parts of the world has the potential to light a fire (pun intended) under Corn, Soybeans, and/or Wheat 
this coming year.
Aiding in the potential for a significant drought to develop somewhere in the world during 2026 
and into 2027 is the fact that three outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) will be in fire signs 
(Aries and Leo) during much of 2026 before fiery Mars adds to this energy when it enters the sign of 
Leo on September 27, where it will remain until November 25. To follow this alignment, there will 
be an even bigger collection of six planets in fire signs during the spring of 2027, when Venus and 
Mercury will join the party as they transit the sign of Aries during April and May 2027. That is a lot 
of heated energy potential in the sky at one time. On top of this, we will have the disruptive planet 
Uranus entering the air sign of Gemini at the end of April. We could see an increase in high winds or 
destructive storm activity during the 2026 growing season.
During 2026, we will want to pay attention when Mars (and sometimes Venus) is making hard 
aspects with Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. As mentioned, these planets will reside in fire signs this 
year and could usher in changes in weather patterns to become more arid, hot, and dry. We should also 
pay attention to when Mars forms hard aspects to Uranus (unpredictable) and Pluto (destructive), as 
severe weather around these times could cause more localized events of crop damage.

163
At the end of the day, weather and climate are fickle creatures. They are a construct of hundreds 
of variables, each continuously affecting the other and constantly changing the outcome. There is a 
reason why local weather forecasters get a bad rap for not being able to accurately predict the weather 
even seven days out—because it’s difficult. All we can do is look at the past and apply those possi-
bilities to the future. For 2026 and into 2027, the heavens are pointing to an elevated risk of adverse 
weather significant enough to affect crop production to a meaningful degree. That does not mean that 
it is going to happen by any means, but it is prudent that we are aware of the possibility.

 CORN
REVIEW
Corn peaked for the year at 504.50 in February 2025. This was not shocking, as last year’s Forecast 
2025 stated: “I would look for Corn to at least test 475.00 at some point during 2025 with an eventual 
upside target of 540.00–600.00. A lot will depend on the growing season in North and South America as 
to how long and how high Corn can rally.” Growing conditions were generally good in North and South 
America, so after peaking, Corn spent the next six months falling to a low of 368.75 in August 2025. This 
was 8.25 cents above the August 2024 low of 360.50 and was likely a successful retest of this long-term 
bottom. Since bottoming, Corn has caught a bid, retracing about 50% of the decline off the February high.

THE 18-YEAR CYCLE
The longest cycle we measure in Corn is the 18-year cycle. It has a range of 15–21 years and 
last bottomed in April 2020 at 300.25. This low was 20 years after the previous 18-year cycle low 
in August 2000, so it was on time. The year 2026 will begin the sixth year of this current 18-year 
cycle, which is not due to bottom again until 2038 +/– 3 years. The high so far for this current 18-year 
cycle occurred in April 2022 when Corn reached 827.00. This was a gain of 175% from the start of 
the cycle. While impressive, it is still a little short of the average trough-to-peak gains of previous 
18-year cycles, which are 308% when throwing out obvious outliers. 
Because we are still relatively early in this 18-year cycle, there is still plenty of time for Corn to 
mount another substantial rally. In fact, in the last three 18-year cycles, the crest formed beyond the half-
way point of the cycle (right translation) in two of them. In the third case, the high occurred in the first 
half of the cycle, but that high was tested (forming a double top) during the second half. This implies 
that Corn has a good chance of at least revisiting the all-time high of 827.00 at some point in the future. 
While we are using 2020 as the starting year for this current 18-year cycle, I think an alternative 
starting year should be entertained. Since 1912, every 18-year cycle in Corn has bottomed within 0–2 
years (usually 0–1) of Wheat’s 18-year cycle. Wheat’s last 18-year cycle bottomed in 2016, so the 2020 
low in Corn would have been four years later. This does not fit the historical cycle relationship between 
these two grains. However, Corn did have a low in August 2016 when it fell to 301.00. This is extremely 
close to the April 2020 low of 300.25—close enough to be considered a double bottom to the August 
2016 low and not the start of this current 18-year cycle. The implication here is that instead of Corn 
being in the sixth year of its 18-year cycle, 2026 would be the 10th year measured from the August 2016 
low. The magnitude of the decline from the 2022 high would argue that this labeling might be a better 
fit. In fact, as time goes by, this is more and more becoming my preferred bias.

THE 9-YEAR CYCLE
The 18-year cycle traditionally breaks down into two 9-year cycle phases. The 18-year cycle can 
also break down into a three-phase pattern of 6-year cycles, but these can be hard to distinguish from 
the 4.6-year half-cycle to the 9-year cycle. Depending on the correct starting year for the 18-year 
cycle (this would also be the starting year for the 9-year cycle, as shorter cycles reset when longer 
cycles culminate), 2026 will either begin the sixth year of the first 9-year cycle phase measured off 
the April 2020 bottom or the second year of the second 9-year cycle phase measured off the August 
2024 bottom. My bias at the moment lies with the latter.
If my bias is correct and we are indeed two years into the second and final 9-year cycle phase, 
then there are historical criteria to watch out for. First, these second 9-year phases rally for only 
2–4 years before topping out. This makes 2026 an early candidate for a 9-year cycle crest to form. 
Second, the percentage gains in this crest have ranged from 119% to 193%. A 119% gain from the 
360.50 low would equate to about 790.00. Reaching this price target would satisfy the third cri-
terion of Corn, at least testing and even exceeding the crest that occurred in the first 9-year cycle 
phase (827.00 in this case). 
To be fair, this would be a substantial move if it were to all occur in 2026, so this may be some-
thing that we will need to revisit in Forecast 2027. However, the move higher has to start somewhere, 
so we may see a nice surge in Corn prices this year with the geocosmic and fundamental backdrop 
in play.
THE 4.6-YEAR AND 33-MONTH CYCLES
If the 9-year cycle is breaking down in a three-phase pattern, it typically consists of three 
33-month cycles. If the 9-year cycle is breaking down into a two-phase pattern, then we usually see 
two 4.6-year cycles (55 months) form. The orb of this 55-month cycle is a little wide at 14 months, 
but that is what you get when analyzing a commodity largely dictated by the weather. In the last few 
instances, the 9-year cycle has been showing a preference for deploying in a two-phase pattern, so we 
will go with the idea that this is going to continue in the current cycle. 

## Page 170

166
If we assume the 18- and 9-year cycles bottomed in 2016, then the April 2020 low would have 
occurred 44 months later and in the time band for a 55-month bottom to form. Measuring from the 
April 2020 low, the August 2024 bottom was 52 months later—again, right on time for a 55-month 
low, and since it was the second 55-month cycle phase, August 2024 was probably a 9-year low as 
well. After an initial rally to the 27-month (half the length of the 55-month cycle) moving average, 
Corn came back to test the 2024 low in August 2025. This is tracing out a similar pattern seen at pre-
vious 9-year lows (the 2008–2009 bottom) and bodes well for the price of Corn in 2026 and onward 
should it continue.
I will be watching for Corn to start closing above the 27-month moving average in 2026, fol-
lowed by the 18-month moving average climbing above the 27-month. This has been a strong signal 
that Corn has indeed formed at least a 4.6-year low. As of this writing in early November, those 
moving averages are sitting around 427.00 and 437.00, and Corn is now poking above the 27-month 
moving average. 
The smallest percentage gain of 55-month cycles has been 30%, but this was in a bearish cycle. 
In bullish first-phase cycles (which I think we are in), the smallest gain has been 54%, while the 
largest was 311%. A 54% rise from the 360.50 low in August 2024 equates to 555.00. Therefore, I 
think 555.00 +/– 25.00 is a reasonable price target for Corn to reach this year. If we do see a drought 
pattern develop over a major corn-producing region of the world, as the Saturn–Neptune conjunction 
suggests is possible, then 601.00 +/– 29.00 becomes a valid price target. 
GEOCOSMICS
Two major geocosmic signatures in 2026 could significantly influence the Corn market. The 
first is the Saturn–Neptune conjunction occurring on February 20, 2026. Like other grains, both 
Saturn–Neptune conjunctions and oppositions have coincided with peaks in grain markets. Since 
1950, there have been two conjunctions and two oppositions. In these previous instances, Corn 
has formed an important crest (18- and 9-year crests) within 8–15 months of the exact aspect. 
Measuring from February 2026, eight months takes us to October 2026, while 15 months takes 
us to July 2027.
The second major aspect for Corn is Jupiter forming a waxing trine to Saturn. In the previous 
three instances of this multi-pass aspect, going back to 1966, Corn has formed significant highs 
during the central time band of this aspect or within four months of the first or last passage. These 
include the 9-year high in August 1966, the 9-year drought high of July 1988, and the June 2008 
9-year high. The central time band of the coming Jupiter–Saturn waxing trine is August 2026–July 
2027. Also, keep in mind that this aspect is occurring with both planets located in fire signs. 
There is a planet/sign combination that has been strongly correlated to crests in the grain 
markets: Ceres transiting the signs of Gemini and Cancer. For those who are unfamiliar, Ceres is 
a dwarf planet that was the goddess of agriculture, grain, and the harvest in Roman mythology. 
Looking back to 1966, Corn has formed at least a 33-month cycle top, or a high followed by at least 
a 20% decline, more than 90% of the time when Ceres was between 5° Gemini and 26° Cancer. 
Ceres enters Gemini in May 2026 and will not exit the sign of Cancer until May 2027 due to its 
retrograde motion.

CONCLUSION
Corn looks to have successfully retested its August 2024 low during 2025 and now appears 
poised to muster a rally in 2026 and possibly lasting into 2027. Closing above the 27-month moving 
average on a monthly basis is essential to confirming this bias. If Corn can do that, taking out the Feb-
ruary 2025 high of 504.50 would then set a technical uptrend of higher highs and higher lows. This 
would then open the door for Corn to reach our conservative price target of 551.00 +/– 25.00. Should 
weather become an issue this year, then 601.00 +/– 29.00 is certainly achievable in 2026.
Based on geocosmics, the best time for Corn to reach these targets is in the second half of 
2026—specifically, September +/– 1 month and then November 20 +/– 2 weeks. It should be noted 
that many of the long-term aspects coinciding with a potential crest in Corn are still in effect in the 
first half of 2027. As such, a high that occurs in 2026 might be followed by a significant decline into 
a 33-month cycle low (due November 2026–November 2027) before another rally takes Corn into a 
more important high in early 2027.

REVIEW 
Wheat was by far the weakest of the three grain markets in 2025, but that was not a complete sur-
prise. Last year’s Forecast 2025 book: “For this reason, my bias is that a 36-month cycle low is still 
ahead of us,” and “… Wheat doesn’t have to drop appreciably below the August 2024 low of 493.50 
when this 36-month cycle does form. It could be just a double bottom or a retest of that low.” Wheat 
did just that by hitting 492.25 in August 2025 and is now rallying above critical moving averages as 
we close the book on 2025.

THE 18-YEAR CYCLE
The longest cycle we measure in Wheat is the 18-year cycle. It has a range of 16–20 years, mak-
ing it the most reliable long-term cycle of all three grain markets. This 18-year cycle last bottomed in 
August 2016 at 359.50 and is next due to bottom in 2034 +/– 2 years. The year 2026 will begin the 10th 
year of the current cycle. So far, Wheat has satisfied one of the criteria of a bullish cycle by trading 
above the previous 18-year cycle crest of 1272.75 when it reached a high of 1363.50 in March 2022 fol-
lowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is a major wheat-producing region of the world. The second 
criterion would be making new highs in the second 9-year cycle phase (which we could be in). For the 
current 18-year cycle, the simple Mid-Cycle Price (MCP) target, which represents the midpoint projec-
tion of the cycle’s expected price range, is 1,395.75 +/– 122.25. The 1272.75 high in 2022 is already 
within that range, which raises the question: has this 18-year cycle already topped out?
Looking at the historical data, Wheat’s 18-year cycles tend to form as double tops to each other. 
When considering this, the March 2022 high of 1363.50 could technically be considered a double 
top to the previous 18-year cycle crest of 1272.75, even though it was almost $1 higher. I think this 
adds to the argument that we probably have seen the high in Wheat for the remainder of this decade, 
barring a black swan type of event (nuclear war?).
THE 9-YEAR CYCLE
Wheat’s long-term 18-year cycle predominantly breaks down into two 9-year cycle phases. The 
9-year cycle last bottomed with the 18-year cycle in August 2016. It was next due to bottom in 2025 
+/– 2 years, which makes the August 2024 low of 493.50 and the October 2025 low of 492.25 both 
candidates for this bottom. I have adjusted my bias slightly and now consider August 2024 to be the 
start of this new 9-year cycle due to the fact that it formed within two weeks of the Jupiter–Saturn 
waxing square that took place on August 19, 2024. Generally, longer-term planetary aspects coincide 
with longer-term cycle tops and bottoms. In the case of Wheat, this would line up. October 2025 
would constitute a successful retest or double-bottom chart formation relative to the August 2024 
low, even though it was lower by a little over one penny.

169
If 2024 is indeed the correct starting year for this current 9-year cycle, 2026 will mark the second 
year of the second 9-year cycle phase. This is where it gets interesting. Since 1885 (yes, you read that 
right), six out of eight second-phase 9-year cycles have topped out in years 2–4 following the low. 
Since 1960, all four second 9-year phases have topped in the third year. This puts 2026 and 2027 in 
the crosshairs for when, historically, a 9-year crest could form. 
Further, the gains of these 9-year cycles have ranged from 25% to 437%. If we throw out the 
outliers, we have a more normal range of 43% to 154%. This yields a possible price target for a crest 
of 704.00–1251.00. A normal Fibonacci price target for a corrective high would be 826.00–1031.00 
and overlaps the price target just given. We will therefore use 928.00 +/– 103.00 as a possible target 
for the crest of this 9-year cycle. Based on historical precedent, this crest could even occur this year.
THE 36-MONTH CYCLE
The 9-year cycle typically breaks down into three 36-month cycle phases. This 36-month cycle 
carries an orb of eight months, which makes its range 26–44 months. It last bottomed with the 9-year 
cycle in August 2024. The previous two 36-month cycles bottomed in April 2019 and August 2022 
and were 32 and 40 months long, respectively. The low in August 2024 was only 24 months from 
the August 2022 low, so it was a little short of the normal range for this cycle. This is okay, however, 
because when longer cycles (such as the 9-year cycle) come due, shorter cycles distort about 50% 
of the time. Admittedly, the October 2025 low would be a better fit here time-wise, as it would have 
been 38 months from August 2022. However, the October bottom did not have a major long-term 
aspect associated with it, as the August 2024 low did, which is why I favor it over the more recent 
October 2025 low.
Regardless of the starting point, this will be the first 36-month cycle phase in a new 9-year cycle. 
First phases in any cycle are usually bullish, and this is indeed the case for Wheat. The average gain 
for a 36-month cycle that is beginning a new 9-year cycle is 84%, with a range of 57%–127%. The 
average time it takes to reach this crest is 26 months, with a range of 17–34 months. Using the August 
2024 low of 493.50, a 57% gain would imply a Wheat price of about 775.00, with an 84% gain reach-
ing about 908.00. Notice that this latter price falls into the possible price target for a 9-year crest given 

## Page 174

earlier. The 17th month from August 2024 is January 2026, while 26 months is October 2026. Taking 
all this into consideration, I think Wheat has an excellent chance of at least hitting 775.00 this year 
and doing so before October 2026.
While my bias is bullish heading into 2026, it should be noted that the start of this 36-month cycle 
has yet to be fully confirmed. It will take prices closing above the 9- and 18-month moving averages, 
with the 9-month average rising above the 18-month. Currently, those averages are around 525.00 
and 550.00, respectively. Wheat is testing the 18-month moving average at the time of this writing, 
so it would not take much additional strength to achieve initial confirmation. However, until this fully 
happens, any monthly (or even weekly) close below the double-bottom lows around 493.00 going 
forward would signal that the 36-month cycle has not bottomed and would be due by April 2026, 
which would be the 44th month from August 2022. Any new low after April 2026 would require 
revisiting the long-term cycle labeling.
GEOCOSMICS
There are two important geocosmic signatures taking place in 2026 that could influence Wheat 
prices. The first is the Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20, 2026. The section on weather 
noted that both Saturn–Neptune conjunctions and oppositions have coincided with peaks in grain 
markets. Since 1950, there have been two conjunctions and two oppositions. In these instances, 
Wheat has formed an important crest within 22 months of the exact aspect. Measuring from February 
2026, 22 months takes us out to December 2027. Because this window is somewhat longer than that 
of the other grain markets surrounding this aspect, it is conceivable that we see either a double-top 
pattern to a high made earlier or a case of bearish intermarket divergence—in which all the grains 
peak in their respective time bands for a meaningful crest, but Wheat makes a marginal new high not 
confirmed by the other grain markets later.
The second important aspect for Wheat is Jupiter forming a waxing trine to Saturn. In the previ-
ous three instances of this multi-pass aspect, going back to 1966, Wheat has formed significant highs 
during the central time band of this aspect. These include the final high in 1966 before a 40% decline 
into an 18-year low, the 18-month high and subsequent low that preceded the sharp move higher dur-
ing the 1988 drought year, the 9-year drought high of July 1988, and the 18-year high that occurred 
in 2008. The central time band of the coming Jupiter–Saturn waxing trine is August 2026–July 2027. 
Also, keep in mind that this aspect is occurring with both planets located in fire signs. 
In addition to the above signatures, Wheat also seems to respond to Jupiter in a waxing trine 
to Neptune. This aspect will be exact on July 20, 2026. In most cases, a tradable low has occurred 
within six weeks of this aspect in the Wheat market. This makes June 20–August 20 a potential bot-
tom in Wheat. This could be a simple primary cycle, but it also falls in the time band when the second 
12-month cycle would be due.
There is yet another planet/sign combination that has strongly correlated with crests in the grain 
markets: Ceres transiting the signs of Gemini and Cancer. For those unfamiliar, Ceres is a dwarf 
planet that was the goddess of agriculture, grain, and the harvest in Roman mythology. Looking back 
to 1966, the high that unfolds has typically been either a 9-year cycle crest or a retracement high fol-
lowed by at least a 30% decline. This has occurred in about 75% of the cases when Ceres was in either 
Gemini or Cancer. Ceres will transit Gemini from May 2026 through May 2027.

CONCLUSION
Wheat appears to have secured a double bottom to the August 2024 low in October 2025. If it 
can confirm this by closing above the 18-month moving average (it is close to doing so), and if the 
9-month moving average can cross above the 18-month, then we will assume Wheat is in the first 
36-month cycle phase of a new 9-year cycle. Because this is the first phase—typically the most 
bullish—I think 2026 could be a good year for Wheat prices; however, since this is the second 9-year 
cycle phase, the rally should ultimately prove corrective in nature, possibly similar to what transpired 
following the 2009 low (see monthly chart). Geocosmics indicate that we should look for this high 
within 22 months of the Saturn–Neptune conjunction taking place in February 2026. Using other 
geocosmic signatures, we can narrow this time band to August 2026–May 2027. 
The price target for this crest is ultimately 928.00 +/– 103.00. Whether we can reach that level 
in 2026 remains to be seen, but I do think 700.00–775.00 is a safe objective for this coming year. If 
at any point Wheat experiences a weekly close below 493.50, these upside targets will have to be 
adjusted, as this would signal that Wheat is not in a new 36-month and 9-year cycle. In this case, a 
low would be due by April 2026.
