is a sign change of every outer planet within the year. Of course, Pluto will already be in Aquarius 
for good, but we’ll see Jupiter ingress into Cancer on June 9, Saturn ingress into Aries on May 24, 
Uranus ingress into Gemini on July 7, and Neptune ingress into Aries on March 30”. 
The analysis went on to state, “But it goes even further than these outer-planetary ingresses. Aside 
from the Jupiter–Saturn square and a square between Jupiter and Neptune on June 18, there are a 
few soft aspects between outer planets that could actually signal comfort, even if temporary, for the 
economy. Saturn is in sextile with Uranus on April 4 and August 11, while Uranus is in sextile with 
Neptune on August 28 and November 20. Interestingly, each of these sextile signatures occurs with the 
respective planets in different signs. The April 4 sextile between Saturn and Uranus will have Saturn 
in Pisces and Uranus in Taurus, while the August 11 sextile will have Saturn in Aries and Uranus in 
Gemini. The August 28 sextile between Uranus and Neptune has Uranus in Gemini and Neptune in 
Aries, but the November 20 sextile has Uranus in Taurus and Neptune in Pisces. This happens because 
of the retrograde motions that are going to take all of these outer planets back into their previous signs, 
except Jupiter and Pluto. Saturn retrogrades back into Pisces on September 1, Uranus retrogrades back 
into Taurus on November 7, and Neptune retrogrades back into Pisces on October 22.” 
It was actually near the sextile between Saturn and Uranus on April 4 that T-Notes completed their 
high of the year. There was also the Jupiter–Saturn square, whose central time band was in effect until 
June 2025. The second of three passages occurred on December 24, 2024, just a couple of weeks before 
the low of the year in T-Notes. It is not my view, however, that either of these highs or lows represented 
significant long-term cycle crests. The January 2025 low was, however, a 50-week trough.
From an outer-planetary standpoint, 2026 is the sequel year to the initial ingresses that occurred in 
2025. Pluto has already been in Aquarius, but 2026 will see Saturn definitively ingress into Aries for 2.5 
years on February 13, Uranus definitively ingresses into Gemini for 7 years on April 25, and Neptune 
ingresses into Aries for 14 years on January 26. Interestingly, 2026 begins with another sextile between 
Saturn and Uranus on January 20. This is the same aspect that coincided with the 50-week bottom in Janu-
ary 2025. It cannot be ruled out that another 50-week cycle trough occurs in either January or February, 
but the primary geocosmic focus for 2026 surrounds the timing of a potential 6-year cycle crest in T-Notes.
Based on the cycle counts discussed in the previous section, the timing for a 6-year cycle crest 
appears to favor the first or second quarter of 2026. It is worth noting that all of the outer-planetary 
ingresses will take place in the first half of 2026, including Jupiter’s ingress into Leo on June 30. 
Outer-planetary ingresses tend to correspond with larger psychological shifts among market partici-
pants, which aligns well with the prospect of a long-term cycle crest in T-Notes. 
There is also a sextile between Saturn and Pluto on March 28. Although sextiles are usually not 
the preferred aspect for marking long-term market reversals, this one could be especially important 
because of the Saturn–Pluto synodic cycle. Remember that the long-term bull market in bonds began 
roughly one year before the Saturn–Pluto conjunction of 1982 and then ended within two months of 
the Saturn–Pluto conjunction of January 2020.
However, there are three outer-planetary aspects taking place in July 2026 that are shaping up 
to be very important for the bond market. The first is the Uranus–Pluto trine on July 18. Then, two 
days later, on July 20, there is an opposition between Jupiter and Pluto. That same day, there is also a 
trine between Jupiter and Neptune. The Uranus–Pluto trine will kick off the central time band of this 
signature, which will remain in effect until May 2028. 

## Page 135

131
The Uranus–Pluto synodic cycle is important for T-Notes as well, because the square signature 
between 2012 and 2015 coincided with “QE-3” from the Fed. Now that another signature is coming 
into effect, could the central bank initiate a new form of unconventional monetary policy? For this to 
occur, some sort of crisis in the bond market would likely need to play out, and, naturally, a long-term 
cycle crest would have to form. Uranus rules innovation, and Pluto rules debt. But both Jupiter and 
Neptune—planets that rule inflation—are involved here as well. Let’s not forget that Neptune in fire 
signs has historically been inflationary, too. 
The combination of the trine between Jupiter and Neptune and the opposition between Jupiter 
and Pluto increases the probability of a massive expansion in inflation expectations. This would be 
bearish for T-Notes and would lead to a rise in interest rates.
But the wild card in this case is the Uranus–Pluto trine. Although it is not my bias that the Fed 
would intervene to stop a rise in interest rates this early in the 6-year cycle, at some point the central 
bank could step in with a surprising program—likely in the form of yield curve control—to stem the 
rise in interest rates. Uranus trine Pluto is the ideal aspect for such an intervention to occur, and it is 
my expectation that this will happen during the central time band between July 2026 and May 2028. 
It is not my view that it will occur in 2026, although it may be possible toward the end of the year if 
inflationary pressures get out of control too quickly.
It is also important to tie in some transits to the Federal Reserve’s natal chart for clues in the 
T-Note market. The natal chart used for this analysis is set for December 23, 1913, at 6:02 p.m. in the 
Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Forecast 2025 stated, “Note that the third and final Jupiter–
Saturn square will hit the Fed’s natal Pluto at zero degrees Cancer. Jupiter will be conjunct Pluto, 
while Saturn is square Pluto. Pluto is known as the “Four D Planet” (debts, downgrades, defaults, 
and deficits), and it rules debt, so it’s obviously a very important planet for an entity that determines 
the price of that debt via interest rates. Jupiter conjunct Pluto could be one of two things. It could 
signal continued easing on behalf of the Fed, since Jupiter has an affinity towards growth, but it 
could also mean an oversupply of debt. In this scenario, the Fed may actually have to slow down on 
interest rate cuts.” 
Interestingly, the Fed did pause in its rate cuts, but it occurred after the second Jupiter–Saturn 
square rather than the final one in June 2025, when Jupiter was on the Fed’s natal Pluto. The Fed then 
resumed rate cuts with Jupiter near its ascendant in September 2025. Due to Jupiter’s retrograde, two 
more conjunctions will take place to the Fed’s ascendant in Cancer: the first on January 25, 2026, and 
the second on April 24, 2026. 
My view is that rate cuts will continue beyond April 24, at least into Jupiter’s opposition to 
the Fed’s natal Uranus at 5 degrees Aquarius. This will occur after Jupiter ingresses into Leo, and 
it will unfold around the same time that transiting Pluto comes within orb of a conjunction to the 
Fed’s natal Uranus.
This combination of planetary aspects seems to be setting up a showdown over control of the 
Fed. The natal Uranus in Aquarius represents the central bank’s strong sense of independence, and 
it looks to be coming under a rather dramatic (Jupiter) attempt at coercion (Pluto) beginning in the 
second half of 2026. It is worth noting that Jerome Powell’s term as Fed Chair is set to end in May 
2026 as well, although he is scheduled to stay on as a governor until 2028. 

## Page 136

132
This geocosmic setup may also involve Scott Bessent’s natal Saturn at six degrees of Aquarius 
(born August 21, 1962; birth time unknown), which is conjunct the Federal Reserve’s natal Uranus. 
Combined with transiting Pluto conjunct the Fed’s natal Uranus, this suggests that the Treasury Sec-
retary could begin to have a major influence on the Fed’s policy decisions. There have already been 
rumors of Bessent being appointed Fed Chair, but the current law prohibits one person from holding 
both positions at the same time. Regardless, the central bank’s independence appears to be under real 
threat in 2026—and it does not end with these aspects, either.
The conjunction between Saturn and Neptune on February 20, 2026, at zero degrees Aries will 
be conjunct the central bank’s midheaven and square its Sun. This spells an identity crisis and raises 
questions surrounding its authority. Authoritative deception is in play here, potentially arising from 
faulty data being sent its way, which could undermine its policy decisions. This already happened in 
2025, when more than 900,000 jobs magically disappeared, and the Fed realized it was behind the 
curve on cutting rates. Something similar could occur in 2026, but perhaps involving understated 
inflation data that encourages the central bank to continue cutting rates.
CONCLUSION
T-Notes are shaping up for additional upside in 2026 now that the newer 6-year cycle scenario 
from October 2023 has been confirmed. My preferred outlook is for prices to rally into a 6-year cycle 
crest in the 121/00–123/00 range sometime between April and August 2026. Keep in mind that this 
will coincide with a 29-month cycle crest as well. The big question is whether another 50-week cycle 
will begin before the 29-month cycle tops out, as there can be two or three 50-week cycles within a 
29-month cycle, depending on the cycle’s length. 
The highs from 2025, 2024, and 2023 are expected to be exceeded in 2026. Since a 29-month 
cycle trough is due by October, the 6-year cycle crest is not likely to produce an immediate sharp 
pullback. This means that at some point, there will be a strong, tradable bounce in T-Notes in 2026. 
However, a significant secondary lower high beneath the high of the year is a potential scenario in 
the fourth quarter of 2026. 
The geocosmics that begin in 2026—especially the Uranus–Pluto trine—point to a managed-
style decline in the T-Note prices over the coming years. Keep in mind that the time band for a 6-year 
cycle trough begins in 2028 and that the central time band of the Uranus–Pluto trine lasts into May 
2028. Since the greater 18-year cycle is bearish, we expect the 6-year cycle phase to record its lowest 
price at the end of its cycle. This means a drop to 105/00–105/10 should be in order, but that is not in 
the cards for 2026, unless we see an expanded 5- to 7-year cycle that takes prices to new lows. This 
is not our bias, however.
Instead, my preferred scenario is to see T-Notes form a 50-week cycle crest in the 114/25–116/20 
range sometime in January or February, followed by a 50-week cycle trough in February or March. 
Then prices would commence another rally into a 29-month and 6-year crest by August. The target 
is as high as 121/00–123/00. A drop into a 29-month cycle low could then occur, with prices falling 
back into the 114/25–116/20 zone. After that, another rally can occur into year-end, but it will not 
take out the 6-year cycle crest. My expectation is for the 29-month cycle that follows the current one 
to be bearish.

The threat against the Fed’s independence may not actually work out as intended. In theory, the 
attempted takeover may begin very late in 2026, after rising rates and inflation start to become a 
problem again. The objective appears to be to artificially peg interest rates below the prevailing rate 
of inflation in order to devalue the debt. Structural issues in the bond market could easily continue 
into the mid-2030s, which lines up with an 18-year cycle bottom. There will also be an opposition 
between Saturn and Pluto around that time, and Neptune will be in the later degrees of Aries. All in 
all, this is a bond market that continues to price in default risk and inflation risk—mainly from gov-
ernments versus private corporations, which may actually prove to offer a safer haven compared with 
government bonds going forward. 
THREE-STAR CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR 2026—T-NOTES
The following is a list of three-star geocosmic critical reversal dates (CRDs) used in MMA’s 
market timing calculations. They are most valid when a market is also in the time band for a primary, 
half-primary, or major cycle crest or trough, but may apply to secondary highs or lows, too, that are 
tradeable. Allow a range of three trading days (sometimes as much as six) to these dates for a reversal. 
Also, use the dates given for CRDs in stocks as well. Both sets will apply to one another, and as you 
see, there will be overlap in many cases between the two lists of CRDs.

 CURRENCY MARKETS IN 2026
Currency markets were very active in 2025. The U.S. Dollar was weak, while the star performer 
was the Swiss Franc. Everyone wanted the safety of the neutral Swiss Franc, even though its central 
bank cut its interest rate to 0% to stop its appreciation. 
The decline in the U.S. Dollar reflected the historical pattern of previous incoming Republican 
administrations in the White House. A lower dollar benefits international trade for U.S. corporations, 
which is also a reason why the Swiss central bank didn’t want its currency to appreciate so much. 
Japan was another reality altogether, as will be discussed in the chapters to follow.
CRITICAL REVERSAL DATES FOR CURRENCIES IN 2026
Unlike other chapters, we will list the critical reversal dates (CRDs) for currencies at the start of 
this chapter so readers do not have to scroll through all four currencies to find them.
The following is the list of three-star geocosmic critical reversal dates (CRDs) used in MMA’s 
market timing calculations for currencies, and especially for the Euro. They are most valid when a 
currency is also in the time band for a primary, half-primary, or major cycle crest or trough, but may 
also apply to tradeable secondary highs or lows. Allow a range of three trading days (sometimes as 
much as six) to these dates for a reversal. Also, use the dates given for CRDs in stocks as well. Both

 THE U.S. DOLLAR INDEX (DXY)
by Ulric Aspegren, MMA Analyst
REVIEW  
In mid-November 2024, when the previous yearly U.S. Dollar report was completed, the green-
back was rising from the September 27, 2024, low at 100.15 USD (9). Last year’s Forecast 2025 
book detailed: “The hard nut to crack question is: did the greater cycle that started in 2008 (4) end in 
2021(8) after 12.8 years, or are we 16.6 years into an older 16-year greater cycle that also originated 
in 2008? The former could set up a long-term bullish run for the U.S. Dollar Index, while the latter 
would be very bearish for the greenback, as the 16-year cycle would be ripe to head lower into its 
greater cycle abyss.”
Looking back on the last twelve months, the Dollar succeeded in ascending a respectable 10% 
from the September 2024 low (9) to 110.17 on January 13, 2025 (I), but then ran completely out of 
steam. So far, a total descent of 12.7% for nine long months has followed, resulting in a low on Sep-
tember 17 at 96.21 (10). The greenback has managed to regain 4.30%, reaching 100.36 on November 
5. Could the September 2025 low have been the long-term cycle bottom for the U.S. Dollar Index, or 
is there more bearishness to come? The DXY closed on November 14, 2025, at 99.299 USD.

THE LONG-TERM CYCLES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR INDEX
As of this writing in mid-November 2025, it is still a challenge to etch out the long-term outlook. 
We got a greater cycle start at the 2008 low (4), at 70.70. If this cycle is still operational, then we are 
17.6 years into it and heading south towards its greater cycle bottom. Historically, this is clearly longer 
than the two previous 13.9- and 15.5-year cycles, which could mean that the Dollar is instead 4 years 
and change into a new, greater cycle that commenced in January 2021, at 89.20 (8). If this is true, then 
the greenback is on a long-term bullish path, on the way towards a greater cycle crest, expected in about 
three years’ time. However, as we only have two samples to compare with, we just cannot forge a reli-
able long-term outlook with such a small sample size. We have to search elsewhere for clues.
THE POLITICAL CYCLE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR
The previous Forecast 2025 book stated: “Under a Democrat administration, the Dollar tends 
to rally into the 16-year cycle crest. Under a Republican, it tends to fall into the 16-year cycle low. 
Hence, the political cycle in the U.S. Dollar does not correspond with a greater cycle trough in 2021 
(8), as the Democrats were in the White House. However, the political cycle does align with a 16-year 
greater cycle crest established in 2022 (H), since the Democrats were still in control of the presi-
dency. Now that the Republicans have overtaken the Oval Office, it would indicate, according to the 
political cycle, that the U.S. Dollar Index is heading towards a 16-year cycle trough. My preferred 
outlook is therefore bearish.”

136
THE 5.2-YEAR LONG-TERM CYCLE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR
The 16-year cycle splits in the bearish long-term scenario into three 5.2-year cycles. The prices 
are here 4.8 years into the third 5.2-year cycle, which started on January 6, 2021, at 89.20 (8). Both 
the final 5.2-year and the 16-year cycle crests were established together on September 28, 2022, at 
114.78 (H). Time-wise, the future 5.2-year cycle low, which should coincide with the 16-year cycle 
trough, is projected to unfold sometime between March 2025 and March 2027 with its one-year orb. 
Hence, we are now within the bottoming time frame for the long-term cycle trough.
As the expectation is that this final 5.2-year cycle should be bearish, we will use its historical 
bearish price declines to estimate the price target for its forthcoming long-term cycle low. The histori-
cal bearish descents from the previous 5.2-year cycle crests are between 25–48% (using 75% of the 
cases), producing a price target span of 60–87 USD. We will use this span as the overall price target 
range for the 16-year cycle trough.
Consequently, the September 17, 2025, low, at 96.21 (10), appears to be too shallow for a greater 
cycle low. Hence, my bias is that the greenback will continue lower. 
U.S. DOLLAR INDEX Preferred Monthly Chart, as of November 14, 2025
THE 36-MONTH LONG-TERM CYCLE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR
The 5.2-year cycle breaks down most of the time into two 36-month cycles. We are now 28 
months into the second 36-month cycle that started on July 14, 2023, at 99.58 (9). The crest of the 
current 36-month cycle did occur on January 30, 2025, at 110.17 (I). This second 36-month cycle, 
with its 6-month orb, is due to bottom out sometime between January 2026 and January 2027. As this 
final 36-month cycle is anticipated to end simultaneously with the completion of the current 5.2-year 
cycle, we can, via overlapping, concentrate the timing for the forthcoming 16-year cycle trough, to 
January 2026–January 2027 as well.
Historically, prices have dropped 19–23% when the 36-month cycles have been bearish. We can 
therefore estimate the price target range for the upcoming bearish 36-month cycle low to 84–89 USD. 
Hence, by overlapping with the overall price target for the 16-year cycle low, we obtain an 84–87 
USD span as one price area where the upcoming long-term cycle low could occur.

## Page 141

137
Once the 16-year cycle trough has bottomed out, prices are expected to rise to a bullish 36-month 
cycle crest, forecasted to take place after 16 to 32 months, at an increase of 16–29%. 
THE 14-MONTH INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLE IN THE U.S. DOLLAR INDEX
The 36-month long-term cycle can be split into either three 45-week (10-month) cycles or two 
14-month cycles, or a combination of both. The best fit at this time is that the first 14-month interme-
diate-term cycle was completed on September 27, 2024, at 100.15, as it was 14 months away from 
the July 2023 low.
The current 36-month cycle should thus be in its second and final 14-month cycle. Last year’s 
report stated: “As we are in a bearish long-term scenario, the expectation is that this second 14-month 
cycle should peak out 1.4 to 3.7 months after the September 2024 low. The bearish historical crest 
data generate a time target range of November 8, 2024–January 17, 2025, for the forthcoming 
14-month cycle top. Price-wise, again using the bearish crest data, we obtain a price target range of 
104.62–110.24, which represents a 4.5–10% rise.” The bearish 14-month cycle crest was established 
on January 13, 2025, at 110.17, which was both within the forecasted time and price target spans. 
My preferred view is that we are 13.5 months into the second 14-month cycle. As the Dollar is 
assumed to be in a bearish long-term scenario, the forecast is that prices should now decline into the 
second 14-month cycle low, projected to occur with its 5.5-month orb, sometime between June 2025 
and April 2026. This 14-month cycle bottom is also anticipated to be a 16-year cycle trough, which nar-
rows the time target to January 2026–January 2027. Hence, via additional overlapping, we can further 
concentrate the timing for the 16-year cycle bottom to January 2026–April 2026. This is a very tight 
time gap for a 16-year cycle trough. Hence, let’s not forget that the greater cycle is always in command, 
and the long-term cycle low could, at least potentially, come in at the latest, by March 2027.
A bearish 14-month cycle low is expected historically to come in at a descent of 10%–22%, 
which computes to 86–99 USD. As a 16-year cycle trough is due to unfold, this decline might be too 
shallow. Nevertheless, we have already estimated a first price target range of 84–87 USD, so we can 
overlap with the 14-month cycle low price objective to further narrow down our target to 86–87 USD. 
When the long-term cycle trough is behind us, the prices should rise to a bullish 14-month cycle crest, 
expected to top out six to eleven months after the low and at an increase of 13–23%. 
GEOCOSMICS
We have the important Saturn–Neptune conjunction in February 2026. As this planetary pair only 
meets once, we will extend the timing by four months on either side of the conjunction, which produces 
a time frame of October 2025–June 2026. This time target range creates a bit of a problem for us, since 
we just got a low on September 17, at 96.22 (10). Although it is slightly off, time-wise there is still a pos-
sibility that the greater cycle trough occurred on this date, as September 2025 is within the time forecast 
for the 5.2-year cycle low. However, the price decline was only 16.2% from the 114.78 top of September 
2022 (H). Consequently, it is more probable that the 16-year cycle trough is still ahead.
Now, we have previously carved out a very narrowed down time target range for the 16-year 
cycle bottom to January–April 2026. Hence, the Saturn–Neptune conjunction does not improve this 
slimmed-down time frame. Nevertheless, I think it is wise to extend the timing for the 16-year cycle 
trough to June 2026, incorporating the later timing portion of this planetary pair conjunction.

TECHNICALS
Last year detailed: “The price action for the last fifteen years has been in a channel defined by 
the two parallel lines (see chart) that started from the 2009 crest (D) and from the 2011 trough (5)… 
A solid signal that the long-term bearish scenario is active would occur if the prices would break sus-
tainably below the lower parallel line, right now, in November 2024, at 100.38, and rising about 0.17 
USD per month. “The prices did indeed break below the lower parallel line in April 2025, supporting 
the bearish outlook. If the prices were to overtake this line, right now at 102.85 and rising, it would 
increase the probability that either the 16-year cycle trough took place in 2021(8) or in September 
2025 (10).
The next support area is the long-term line that joins the crests of 2001 (B) and 2017 (F). It is 
currently at 93.85 and falling about 0.09 USD per month. If the prices decline sustainably below this 
significant support line (in place now for 24 years), it will send a second forceful signal that the prices 
are heading to the greater cycle trough. Although the estimated price target for the forthcoming long-
term cycle low suggests prices should head below this line, we must still be on the alert that this line 
could be where the 16-year cycle trough occurs. 
Finally, we have a support line, passing through the lows 4 & 5. It is at this time at 81.57 and 
rising about 0.050 USD per month. If the U.S. Dollar Index falls below the 84–87 level, then this is a 
potential reversal zone for the upcoming 16-year cycle trough. The ideal setup would be if the prices 
could temporarily break below this important support line, cementing the greater cycle low. On the 
other hand, as it is getting very late in the greater cycle, there might not be enough time to reach this 
lowest line.
BIAS
Last year, even though the prices were rising from the September 2024 low (9), my bias was 
bearish for the Dollar, a judgment that was only hanging in the balance on the political cycle. There 
were no other clues. This bearish bias strengthened in April 2025, when the prices broke below the 
lower parallel line.
The final concern is whether the September 17, 2025, low at 96.21 (10) could have been the 
16-year cycle trough. It was within its time target span, but as it was not within the estimated price 
target range, I am biased that the greenback is heading lower and thus that the 16-year cycle trough 
is still ahead.
Nevertheless, if, against my bias, the prices would now instead rise, overtaking, at first, the 
lower parallel line, then the Dollar could be in a long-term bullish trend from a greater cycle trough, 
cemented in January 2021, or even in September 2025. This bullish outlook would be powerfully 
reinforced if the previous 14-month cycle crest, established on January 13, 2025, at 110.17 (I), is sur-
passed, as it would confirm that a new 14-month cycle is in a bullish trend. However, it is only when 
the September 2022 crest, at 114.78 (H), is overtaken that we would have the confirmation that the 
long-term bullish alternative is active.

 U.S. DOLLAR/YEN
by Gianni Di Poce, MMA Analyst
REVIEW
The Dollar/Yen had an inside year in 2025. The high of the year occurred early in the year, on 
January 10 at 158.87, while the low of the year occurred on April 22, 2025, at 139.86. This was below 
the high of 2024 but above the low of 2024 as well. Throughout most of the year, the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) allowed interest rates on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) to rise. This caused some weak-
ness in the Dollar/Yen exchange rate, but with the election of Sanae Takaichi in 2025, markets are 
starting to price in a return to “Abenomics” policies. These economic policies centered on weakening 
the Japanese Yen in order to manage the country’s debt load. This creates a backdrop for potential 
strength in the Dollar/Yen in 2025, and it is supported by the long-term cycle situation as well.
Last year’s Conclusion section stated, “The weight of the evidence of the Dollar/Yen being in a 
new 4.125-year cycle is very compelling. The biggest question for the Dollar/Yen now, given its late-
ness of the 16.5-year cycle, is whether it can go on to make new cycle and multi-decade highs. Given 
the geocosmic backdrop, our bias is that USD/JPY will retest the 164.00 +/- 2.00 zone and probably 
rally as high as 175.00–177.00. It cannot entirely be ruled out that a 16.5-year cycle crest forms in 
2025 in this zone of 175.00–177.00, but this is not our bias. On the contrary, the geocosmics of 2025 
suggest we’re only getting a preview, due to retrograde motions, of a more profound crisis to come in 
the Dollar/Yen in 2026. Eventually, we could see the Dollar/Yen rally as high as 220.00–225.00, but 
probably not in 2025. This may coincide with the greater long-term 16.5-year cycle.” 
While the Dollar/Yen did not rally up to the target of 175.00–177.00, it held firmly in the 139.00 
+/– 2.00 zone, essentially completing a double bottom to the September 2024 low. This low occurred 
seven months later, and it is not uncommon to see retests of important long-term cycle bottoms 6–22 
months later. It will also be a matter of whether the Bank of Japan reverts to a more accommodative 
monetary policy and stops allowing yields on JGBs to rise. There may be a final attempt at lowering 
yields with the new administration in power.
THE LONG-TERM CYCLES IN THE DOLLAR/YEN
The longest cycle to watch in the Dollar/Yen is 16.5 years. The prior low was on October 31, 
2011, at 75.55, and 2026 starts the 15th year of the cycle. This long-term cycle points to a low around 
August 2028 +/– 3.5 years, so a low is due at any time. But first, the crest for this long-term cycle 
must be confirmed. As it stands, the crest from July 2024 at 161.99 is holding, but there is still a pos-
sibility that USD/JPY can rally one final time before reversing lower.
Historically, the 16.5-year cycle broke down into phases lasting 5.5 years, or 55–77 months. 
However, in this cycle, a two-phase pattern composed of two 8.25-year cycles appears to have taken 
hold. An 8.25-year cycle trough unfolded in March 2020, making 2026 the sixth year in the 8.25-year 
cycle. This cycle is calling for a low between 2027 and 2029, so in theory, USD/JPY could still hit 
a new cycle high this year before beginning a drop into an 8.25-year cycle low. This 8.25-year cycle 
crest would form together with the 16.5-year cycle crest.

There is, however, a slim chance that a 16.5-year cycle bottom occurred in April 2025 with the low 
at 139.86. This is not a very likely scenario, but it is a possible one, especially if the 16.5-year cycle 
broke down into a three-phase pattern with three 5.5-year cycles. The 5.5-year cycle has a range of 55–77 
months, and from the October 2011 low, the June 2016 low was 56 months. If the secondary low of Janu-
ary 2021 is considered with respect to the initial March 2020 low, it occurred 55 months from June 2016. 
Finally, the April 2025 low would be 51 months from January 2021, which is a bit short for a 5.5-year 
cycle trough; however, with a potential 16.5-year cycle bottom looming, it is not uncommon for shorter 
cycles to contract. This scenario is not a high-probability one, but it exists nonetheless. It represents the 
most bullish scenario for USD/JPY, as 2026 could start the first year of a new 16.5-year cycle.
The 8.25-year cycle is then broken down into two 4.125-year cycle phases. The first 4.125-year 
cycle low within the 8.25-year cycle occurred on September 16, 2024, at 139.56. Forecast 2025 
stated, “It’s now the final 4.125-year cycle phase within the greater 8.25-year cycle phase, and we’re 
in the second 8.25-year cycle phase within the greater 16.5-year cycle. Thus, we expect this 4.125-
year cycle crest to coincide with the 16.5-year cycle crest too. A rally as high as 175.00-177.00 can-
not be ruled out in 2025. Our bias is for the 164.00 +/- 2.00 zone to be tested, and then, eventually, 
exceeded given the new 4.125-year cycle.” 
It did not rally up to 175.00–177.00 in 2025, but this upside objective remains on the table for 
2026 and beyond. The year 2026 will mark only the second year in the second and final 4.125-year 
cycle. This cycle’s crest will coincide with the greater 8.25-year and 16.5-year cycle crests.
THE INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLES IN THE DOLLAR/YEN
The 4.125-year cycle breaks down further into either two 22.5-month cycle phases or three 
17-month cycle phases. The 22.5-month cycle represents not only a half-cycle phase of the 4.125-
year cycle, but also one of the three phases of the 5.5-year cycle. The 4.125-year cycle that bottomed 
in September 2024 broke down into a three-phase pattern of 17-month phases. Forecast 2025 stated, 
“The question now is whether this final 4.125-year cycle phase to the greater 8.25-year cycle will 
break down into two 22.5-month or three 17-month cycles. It is still too early to tell, but January 2025 
will begin the 4th month in this new intermediate-term cycle. Since it’s the first phase of a new 4.125-
year cycle, we anticipate it to be bullish and rally into June or July at least.” 
So far, the high of this first phase of the 4.125-year cycle occurred on January 10, 2025, at 158.87. 
Thus, my expectation is for new cycle highs to follow in 2026, although it is not yet certain what the 
phase breakdown of this cycle will be. January 2026 will start the 16th month from the September 
2024 low, and so if there is going to be a 17-month cycle phase, then a crest could be anticipated 
in the first quarter of 2026 at the latest. A low would be expected no later than April or May 2026. 
However, if there are going to be two 22.5-month cycle phases, USD/JPY could easily rally into the 
back half of 2026. A 22.5-month cycle trough would be due by December 2026, though. Even so, the 
intermediate-term cycles point to more upside for USD/JPY throughout the majority of 2026.

GEOCOSMICS
There are a plethora of geocosmic setups that continue to warn of problems for the Japanese 
Yen in 2026. In other words, the outlook favors significantly more upside in 2026 and beyond. In all 
likelihood, the crest will be very climactic. The geocosmics in play for 2026 point to a resurgence 
in inflationary pressures, and the setup is shaping up to be bullish for USD/JPY. It begins with the 
conjunction between Saturn and Neptune at zero degrees Aries on February 20, 2026. Throughout 
2025, the loose conjunction between these two planets kept a lid on inflation. Still, as they begin 
to separate in 2026, the restrictive forces of Saturn may no longer serve to contain the inflationary 
nature of Neptune in a fire sign. 
Then there is a series of aspects in July and August that could prove pivotal for debt markets, 
which are directly connected to currency markets. It begins with the trine between Uranus and 
Pluto, an aspect that will remain in effect into 2028. The central time band begins on July 18, 
and then two days later, there is a trine between Jupiter and Neptune, and an opposition between 
Jupiter and Pluto (both on July 20). With Pluto involved here, debt markets must be considered, 
as Pluto rules debt. With Jupiter and Neptune involved, inflation must be considered, as they co-
rule this monetary phenomenon. There is another exact hit of Uranus trine Pluto toward the end 
of 2026 as well, on November 26. Each of these exact trines should be considered “hot spots” for 
a potential intervention in either debt or currency markets, and the Bank of Japan is well known 
for doing this.
Speaking of Japan’s central bank, these outer-planetary transits should be considered in 
terms of aspects to its natal chart. The central bank’s official website states that it was estab-
lished on October 10, 1882, but the birth time is not provided, so we can only analyze aspects. 
Forecast 2025 stated, “For 2025, there are a few key transits that could compound the Bank of 
Japan’s woes. On the top of the list is Uranus ingressing into Gemini on July 7. This is because 
Uranus will move into orb of an opposition with the BOJ’s natal Venus at 2 degrees Sagittarius. 
Granted, there won’t be an exact aspect, as Uranus only makes it to the first degree of Gemini 
before retrograding back into Taurus on November 7. But still, Uranus opposite Venus is a 

## Page 146

142
classical transit for currency collapse or monetary shocks. However, around the same time, Nep-
tune ingressing into Aries will form a trine to the BOJ’s natal Venus. Thus, the combined forces 
of Uranus and Neptune will be influencing Venus at the same time. Neptune may counteract some 
of the shock associated with Uranus and provide an illusion that all is under control, or it may 
lead to hysteria surrounding the collapse of the Japanese Yen. Keep in mind that it’s in the first 
phase of a long-term cycle, which is usually when a market is at its most bullish. It’s unlikely the 
crest of the 4.125-year cycle will occur in 2025, but rather, when the exact aspects to Venus take 
place in 2026.” 
Uranus makes its definitive ingress into Gemini on April 25, and by late June, there will finally be 
an exact opposition to the Bank of Japan’s natal Venus. Thus, I am looking for an acceleration to the 
upside in the value of the Dollar against the Yen throughout the summer of 2026. It is also worth not-
ing that before this final ingress into Gemini takes place, Uranus will be conjunct the natal Pluto of the 
Bank of Japan. 
The central bank allowed interest rates on Japanese government bonds to rise throughout much 
of 2025, and this led to some strength in the Japanese Yen and weakness in the Dollar/Yen exchange 
rate. However, this policy is likely to be abandoned once Uranus moves away from Pluto in late Tau-
rus. This would be consistent with a return to Abenomics-style policies in Japan, which are centered 
around weakness in the Japanese Yen and, therefore, a higher USD/JPY exchange rate.
There are other transits to consider in the BOJ’s natal chart. Pluto forms an exact square with the 
Bank of Japan’s natal Mars in Scorpio starting in June–July of 2026. Although Mars rules Scorpio, 
Mars square Pluto is a classic signature of conflict. Pluto rules debt and manipulations. Forecast 
2025 stated, “The Bank of Japan may literally be fighting (Mars) to keep their bonds (Pluto) from 
crashing, but in doing so, may lose complete control over the Yen’s value. It’s unlikely that this 
conflict will culminate in 2025, but by the end of the year, it will become very obvious that it’s a 
serious issue.” As of this writing, the Dollar/Yen has not reached this crisis point, but the exact 
square between Pluto and Mars still has not occurred. There are stronger odds of this happening in 
2026 compared with 2025.
CONCLUSION
2026 will start only the second year in the second and final 4.125-year cycle phase within the 
greater 8.25-year cycle. The Dollar/Yen is in the second and final 8.25-year cycle phase within 
the greater 16.5-year cycle, of which 2026 starts the 15th year. Thus, the Dollar/Yen is in the late 
stages of multiple long-term cycles, but final phases can go parabolic and take markets to unthink-
able highs. The geocosmic backdrop is present in 2026 for a meteoric rise in the Dollar/Yen to 
occur, between Uranus’s opposition to the Bank of Japan’s Venus and Pluto’s square to the Bank 
of Japan’s Mars.
My bias is that USD/JPY will retest the 164.00 +/– 2.00 zone early on in 2026 and, in all likeli-
hood, rally as high as 175.00–177.00 at some point during the year. If it cannot test, and preferably 
exceed, the 164.00 +/– 2.00 zone by June, it may be the case that the 16.5-year cycle already formed 
its crest back in 2024, although this is not my preferred outlook. In fact, given the geocosmic back-
drop in the coming years, I could see the Dollar/Yen surge as high as 220.00–225.00, but probably not 
in 2026. This would likely coincide with the greater long-term 16.5-year cycle.

143
The most important cycle to watch for in terms of a crest and a reversal back lower in the Dollar/
Yen in 2026 is the 17-month or 22.5-month cycle. It is still unclear whether the 4.125-year cycle is 
breaking down into a two- or three-phase pattern. A 17-month cycle bottom is most likely by the first 
quarter of 2026, and it is likely to hold above 150.00–152.00. If this level were to break, it would 
increase the odds that the longer-term cycles are topping out. A break below 140.00–142.00 in 2026 
would confirm that the 16.5-year cycle crest has peaked and that the Dollar/Yen could drop as low as 
128.00–130.00, but this is not in my preferred playbook for 2026, especially given the signatures in 
the Bank of Japan’s chart and the inflationary mundane backdrop. Overall, 2026 appears to be a very 
bullish year for the Dollar/Yen as all of the factors are weighed.

 THE EURO
by Ulric Aspegren, MMA Analyst
REVIEW
In mid-November 2024, when the Euro report for the upcoming Forecast 2026 book was com-
pleted, the Euro was in freefall. The prices had managed previously to establish a peak at 1.127 USD 
in July 2023 (E), after rising 18% from an important trough at 0.953 USD in September 2022 (5). 
The prices tried to surpass this July 2023 crest, but stalled at 1.121 in September 2024, just below the 
tip of a massive triangle pattern. The situation did not look promising for the Euro, as it had already 
declined 5% from its September 2024 top. At the time, we were in the 25th month since the Septem-
ber 2022 bottom, and the question was: will the bearish trend endure, or is there hope for the bulls?
Last year’s forecast detailed that the ongoing descent was a normal bullish correction to a 
24-month cycle low, which was due to unfold sometime between April 2024 and March 2025. The 
prices kept falling, but finally reversed in the 28th month, on February 3, 2025, at 1.014 (6). A 
24-month cycle trough was thus cemented within the time target, following an overall 10% decline 
from the 24-month cycle crest in July 2023 (E).
As forecasted, the prices have since been in a bullish trend, rallying 17.5% so far to 1.1918 as of 
September 25, 2025. However, is this rally a sustainable affair, or is it just a transitory push-up from 
an intermediate-term cycle low before the Euro heads south again? The Euro closed on November 
14, 2025, at 1.162.

THE LONG-TERM CYCLES IN THE EURO
My favored view is that a Euro greater cycle trough took place on September 28, 2022, at 0.954 
USD (5). The prior greater cycle started in October 2000 (1) and was active for close to 22 years. We 
only have one previous greater cycle to compare with, which began in February 1985. It was opera-
tional for 16 years, as it ended in October 2000. Hence, it is possible that the greater cycle is a 19-year 
cycle, with a 3-year orb. However, my bias is that it is a 16-year cycle and that the previous 22-year 
cycle was a distorted greater cycle and thus an outlier. Time will have to tell.
Assuming the 16-year cycle is the greater cycle, it should normally divide into two 8.4-year cycles. 
In its turn, the 8.4-year cycle has always split into two 4-year cycles. Hence, the assumed greater 16-year 
cycle should now be in its third year and a few months, off the September 2022 trough (5). This is the 
same for the 8.4-year and the 4-year cycles, as all three long-term cycles began at the same low (5). 
The current 4-year cycle is forecast to top out sometime between August 2025 and November 
2026, at 1.313–1.584, an increase of 38%–66%. Once the prices have peaked out, they should head

145
south to the first 4-year cycle low, anticipated in the time frame December 2025–October 2027, at a 
decline of 15%–26%. 
EURO Preferred Monthly Chart, as of November 14, 2025.
THE 24-MONTH INTERMEDIATE-TERM CYCLE IN THE EURO
My preferred outlook is that the 4-year cycle is separating into two 24-month intermediate-term 
cycles. Last year’s report stated: “We should thus be twenty-five months into this first intermediate-
term cycle that began at the September 2022 low. As it is getting late in the cycle to make a higher 
high, my favored view is that the 24-month cycle crest was already established in July 2023 at 1.127 
USD. If this is correct, then the Euro is on its way towards a 24-month cycle bottom, estimated to 
occur with its 6-month orb, sometime between April 2024 and March 2025.”
Moreover, “The historical 6–20% bullish declines of the 24-month cycles generate a price target 
span of 0.897–1.056. The 38.2–61.8% retracement from the 1.127 crest to the 0.953 low produces a 
price objective range of 1.019–1.061. The overlap creates 1.019–1.056, as the most probable price 
target range for the forthcoming 24-month cycle low.”
The 24-month cycle low was established on February 3, 2025, at 1.014 (6). This bottom occurred 
after an acceptable twenty-eight months from the September 2022 low and was within the set time 
target. The bottom was also within the historical price target span, but manifested slightly below the 
61.8% retracement price level.
Further, last year’s report stated: “Once the 24-month cycle low is in place, the prices are expected 
to rise within this second and current 24-month cycle to the 4-year cycle crest. This crest, already 
forecasted earlier, is anticipated to unfold sometime between August 2025 and November 2026, at 
1.313–1.584 USD.”
As the prices within this second 24-month cycle have overtaken the previous 24-month cycle 
crest of July 2023, at 1.127 (E), it confirms that the current 24-month cycle is in a bullish trend. The 
forthcoming 24-month cycle crest is anticipated to manifest sometime between March and November 
2026, at 1.199–1.471 (an increase of 18–45%). When we overlap the objectives of the 4-year and the 
24-month cycle crests, we obtain March–November 2026 and 1.313–1.471 as the most probable time 
and price targets for the 4-year cycle peak.

## Page 150

146
So far, the Euro has risen 17.5% from the February 3, 2025, low (6), establishing a yearly high 
on September 17, 2025 at 1.1918. We actually have to go back to the end of June 2021 to reach a 
higher price level. 
Once the 4-year cycle crest is in place, the prices are expected to decline to the 4-year cycle 
trough, projected to take place sometime between December 2025 and October 2027. We can narrow 
down this time target range with the time objective for the second 24-month cycle low, estimated to 
occur with its 6-month orb, in the time frame August 2026–August 2027. 
The 4-year cycle low should manifest at historical price declines of 14.8–25.8%. You may over-
lap this range with the 38.2–61.8% retracement from the newly formed 4-year cycle crest to the 0.953 
low of September 2022 (5), to obtain the most probable price target span for the 4-year cycle bottom.
GEOCOSMICS
The current 4-year cycle is expected to peak out sometime in the concentrated time band of 
March–November 2026. We have the important Saturn–Neptune conjunction in February 2026. As 
this planetary pair connects only once, we will extend the timing by four months on either side of the 
conjunction, which generates a time period of October 2025–June 2026. Via overlapping, we acquire 
March–June 2026, which is the most probable timing for the 4-year cycle crest. As already seen, the 
4-year cycle low is then expected to cement, at the latest, by August 2027.
TECHNICALS
As you can see on the chart, the prices have managed since last year’s report to surpass a sub-
stantial resistance line, which joins the 2001 and the 2017 lows. As long as prices can stay above this 
now important support line, the bulls are in control.
If we look to the future, we can see that the line that crosses through the 2010 low (3) and the 
2018 crest (D) is at about 1.334 in March 2026, which is at the beginning of the narrowed-down time 
target range and at the lower edge of the price target span for the 4-year cycle crest. This area could 
be the area where the 4-year long-term cycle peaks out.
BIAS
My bias is that the Euro will remain in a long-term bullish trend until at least the upcoming 4-year 
cycle crest, which is due to unfold sometime in the narrowed-down time frame of March–June 2026. 
We should then get a correction down to the 4-year cycle trough, expected, at the latest, by August 
2027. However, once the 4-year cycle bottom is cemented, the prices should, if history repeats itself, 
continue higher within the next 4-year cycle to a combined 8 and 16-year cycle crest. However, we 
must be on the alert that the 16-year cycle peak could already manifest at this forthcoming 4-year 
cycle top (anticipated sometime between March–June 2026).
If, against my bias, the prices were now to decline below the 1.014 low of February 2025 (6), 
then the current 24-month cycle would turn into a bearish trend, confirming that the 24-month cycle 
crest is behind us. The lowest price of this ongoing intermediate-term cycle will be at its very end, 
sometime between August 2026 and August 2027. Nevertheless, we would only have the confirma-
tion that the whole 16-year cycle has turned bearish if the 0.953 low of September 2022 (5) is broken. 
If this were to occur, then we might even need to revise the whole long-term chart labeling for the 
Euro, where the current 16-year cycle would more likely have started in January 2017.

 THE SWISS FRANC
by Gianni Di Poce, MMA Analyst
REVIEW 
The Swiss Franc in 2025 was exceptionally strong as it rallied to its highest level since 2011. 
The high of the year was on September 17, 2025, at 1.2904, and the low of the year was on February 
3, 2025, at 1.0923. Once again, the Swiss Franc was one of the strongest-performing fiat currencies 
of 2025, and that’s even with the Swiss National Bank (SNB) cutting rates back down to zero. This 
clearly was not enough to reduce demand for this safe-haven currency. In a world filled with geopo-
litical turmoil, the neutrality of Switzerland has been very appealing to investors. 
But perhaps the biggest development of 2025 was the reset of an 8.25-year cycle. The big ques-
tion, however, is whether this cycle low occurred in May 2024 at 1.0899 or in February 2025 at 
1.0923. Note how this February 2025 low occurred in the 6–22 month secondary low window that 
often occurs at long-term cycle bottoms. Forecast 2025’s conclusion section stated, “If the Swiss 
Franc is in a newer 8.25-year cycle from May 2024, then a rally as high as 1.2750 +/–.0150 cannot 
be ruled out. The biggest thing is that we expect either a high above the high of 2024 at 1.2036 or a 
low below the low of 2024 at 1.0900.” This long-term cyclical reset could prove to be a major tail-
wind for the Swiss Franc in the coming years, and points to higher prices.

THE LONG-TERM CYCLES IN THE SWISS FRANC
The Swiss Franc’s longest cycle is 16.5 years. While this cycle has been shown to fit well for this 
currency, there have only been two previous occurrences, which means it doesn’t have the strongest 
statistical reliability. Nonetheless, previous lows occurred in February 1985, July 2001, and then 
again in December 2016. Note that although there are three lows, they make up only two cycles, 
since they are measured low-to-low. The July 2001 bottom was at 0.5492, and the December 2016 
low occurred at 0.9669. This means the next 16.5-year cycle trough in the Swiss Franc is due in 2032 
+/– 3 years. But perhaps the most exciting development with respect to the 16.5-year cycle is how 
prices hit a new cycle high in 2025. This high in the 9th year is a strong signal that this is a bullish 
16.5-year cycle. Forecast 2025 stated, “… ample time remains for new highs in this currency. Not 
to mention, a Republican president will be in the White House starting in 2025, and historically, 
this corresponds with a weaker Dollar, which means that the Swiss Franc could yet make new cycle 
highs.” And indeed, new highs followed.
The 16.5-year cycle typically breaks down into two 8.25-year cycles. Historically, this has mani-
fested as a two-phase pattern, with each phase lasting approximately 8.25 years. However, the current 
16.5-year cycle may not be breaking down accordingly this time. It could be exhibiting three 5.5-year

cycles, too, but this is not our bias. The previous 8.25-year cycle lows were in July 2001 (100 months 
from March 1993), November 2008 (88 months from July 2001), and December 2016 (96 months 
from November 2008). The 8.25-year cycle has historically shown a range of 88–100 months. 
Given this range, there are two possible scenarios for an 8.25-year cycle trough. The February 
2025 low would have been 98 months from the December 2016 low, but then there’s also the May 
1, 2024, low, which was 89 months from December 2016. Either way, there is strong evidence that 
a long-term cyclical reset took place in the Swiss Franc. In January 2026 will either enter the 11th 
month in a slightly newer 8.25-year cycle in the Swiss Franc from the February 2025 low, or it will 
begin the 20th month from the May 2024 low. Under the February 2025 labeling, the next 8.25-year 
cycle low wouldn’t be due until June 2032–June 2033. Note how this overlaps with the time band 
for the greater 16.5-year cycle. This is to be expected as it’s in the second 8.25-year cycle phase 
within the 16.5-year cycle. Under the May 2024 labeling, the low wouldn’t be due until September 
2031-September 2032.
Next, the possibility of a 5.5-year cycle must be addressed. To be clear, there haven’t been any 
instances of a 5.5-year cycle going back to 1985. However, cycles are known to break down into 
smaller phases that are divided by two or three of the greater cycle length. Plus, 5.5-year cycles are 
observed in other currency markets. In this scenario, November 2022 would have been a 5.5-year 
cycle bottom. January 2026 would begin the 38th month from November 2022, or the 4th year, and 
there would still be time for new highs, although a crest could easily form in 2026. This is only the 
second 5.5-year cycle phase within the greater 16.5-year cycle, and a low would be due between May 
2027 and May 2029. The 5.5-year cycle phase to follow out of such a low could easily be bearish 
since the 16.5-year cycle would be very late then, but it’s too soon to know for sure.
The other long-term factor to consider in the Swiss Franc is the two-phase pattern to the 8.25-
year cycle, which is made up of two 4-year cycles. The 4-year cycle would have reset with the 8.25-
year cycle, which means that the Swiss Franc is now in the first 4-year cycle phase in this newer 
8.25-year cycle. 2026 would either begin the 1st or 2nd year of this 4-year cycle phase, depending on

whether the greater 8.25-year cycle bottomed in May 2024 or February 2025. Note that the previous 
4-year cycle exhibited a case of contraction, as the prior low was in November 2022. But such cases 
of contraction are not uncommon when longer cycles come due, as the 8.25-year cycle overpowers 
the 4-year cycle. It’s still early enough in this 4-year cycle for the Swiss Franc to climb to new highs, 
and in all likelihood, into the 1.3200 +/– .0200 zone at least.
GEOCOSMICS
From a mundane astrological standpoint, one of the risks for the Swiss Franc in 2026 is that the 
Swiss National Bank may struggle to keep interest rates low if inflation resurges. Between Neptune 
making its definitive ingress into Aries starting on January 26, 2026, and Jupiter’s eventual ingress 
into Leo on June 30, and the subsequent trine between the two planets on July 20, there’s a real threat 
of another inflationary wave in 2026. However, this may turn out to be bullish for the Swiss Franc, 
because it would eventually force the Swiss National Bank to raise interest rates again. Keep in mind 
that rates have been cut back to zero in Switzerland, and this hasn’t been enough to stem the rise in 
the Swiss Franc. It’s not my bias that the Swiss National Bank hikes in 2026, but if they were to begin 
considering rate hikes again, it probably wouldn’t be before the Jupiter–Pluto opposition of August 31. 
Transits to the Swiss National Bank’s natal chart can also be considered. The central bank was 
established on June 19, 1906, by the National Bank Act, but it didn’t start operating until June 16, 
1907. There is no birthtime available, but outer planetary aspects can still be analyzed. The location 
of this chart is Zurich, Switzerland. Forecast 2025 stated, “The first planetary placement that stands 
out is the SNB’s natal Venus at 29 degrees of Taurus. Not only is the 29th degree of a sign considered 
to be karmically potent, but Venus also rules currencies. It’s no surprise that the Swiss Franc is one 
of the strongest currencies from a historical standpoint, with Venus in Taurus, a sign she rules. But 
in 2025 and into 2026, we will see Uranus transit over this degree on multiple occasions. Uranus 
will go retrograde and direct within the orb of Venus as well. Transiting Uranus conjunct Venus is a 
classical currency boom or bust signature. Thus, we have the geocosmic catalyst here for the Swiss 
Franc to potentially collapse as low as 1.0200 +/– 0.0100 in 2025 for an 8.25-year cycle low. A 
sharp rally would likely follow given the nature of this transit. But in the event it’s a newer 8.25-year 
cycle from May 1, 2024, we could see the Swiss Franc explode higher in value, and potentially rally 
as high as 1.2750 +/– .0150 in 2025. This scenario is supported by the political cycle as well. Ura-
nus will hit the 29-degree mark of Taurus in June 2025, which is a bit late given the 88–100-month 
cycle range of the Swiss Franc’s 8.25-year cycle. If the low is complete below, then it could coincide 
with a surge higher.” The newer 8.25-year cycle scenario was in play, and indeed, the Swiss Franc 
exploded higher just above the upside target of 1.2750 +/– .0150 last year. The high of the year was 
in September 2025 at 1.2904.
Looking ahead into 2026, there are a few notable transits that stand out in the SNB’s natal chart. 
First, there will be both Saturn and Jupiter returns for the central bank. The Saturn return is very early 
in the year, January 13. The Jupiter return occurs a couple of times due to retrograde motions on 
February 15 and April 3. If anything, these conjunctions will serve to further reinforce the value of 
the Swiss Franc for the first few months of 2026. There will even be another conjunction with transit-
ing Uranus over the Swiss Franc’s natal Venus on April 23. This may serve to coincide with another 
notable surge in the value of the Swiss Franc +/- 1 month.
However, the prospect for volatility in the Swiss Franc starts to increase starting in May, as there 
will be a T-square between Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Transiting Saturn will be at the apex, as 

## Page 154

Uranus and Neptune are in opposition in the SNB’s natal chart, in Capricorn and Cancer, respectively. 
Due to retrograde motions, there will be another passage of this T-square in late September and early 
October. Thus, the Swiss Franc may experience a period of sharp volatility between late May and 
early October. It could start as an initial spike to the upside, followed by a sharp drop to the downside, 
or vice versa, but this seems to be the hot spot for the currency in 2026. Remember that if the mar-
ket sniffs out that the SNB is going to eventually start raising rates again, it could lead to a flood of 
money rushing into this safe-haven currency. It’s also worth pointing out that the Uranus–Pluto trine, 
which is the feature signature of 2026 and beyond, does not aspect the Swiss National Bank chart at 
all throughout this year. If anything, this may prove to provide some extra stability, which is highly 
sought after in this current market environment. 
CONCLUSIONS
There are still questions as to whether the Swiss Franc is breaking down into a two-phase, a 
three-phase, or even a combination pattern when it comes to the 16.5-year cycle. As of this writ-
ing in November 2025, my bias is increasingly that a combination pattern with both 8.25-year and 
5.5-year cycle phases is playing out. The breakout to new multi-year highs in 2025 confirmed that 
an 8.25-year cycle bottomed either in May 2024 or February 2025 (the latter can be considered a 
double-bottom, or secondary low). The Swiss Franc is still early enough in the 8.25-year cycle for 
the currency to exceed the 2025 highs in 2026. However, it’s not as probable that a sustained surge 
similar to what was witnessed in 2025 will play out in 2026.
The 5.5-year cycle is still early enough to carry the Swiss Franc to new multi-year highs as well. 
Ideally, a rally up to the 1.3900–1.4000 zone can occur before the longer-term 16.5-year cycle tops 
out, and while this is the best-case scenario for the Swiss Franc in 2026, it’s not the likeliest one. 
Instead, a rally up to the 1.3400–1.3600 area is the preferred target for 2026. My bias is that the Swiss 
Franc won’t see lower prices than 1.2200–1.2300 in 2026 either. In other words, new highs above 
the 2025 highs are on the table, but new lows below the 2025 lows are not (that would be quite the 
reversal back lower). In fact, the sooner the Swiss Franc breaks above 1.2600–1.2700, the sooner that 
becomes the new floor, or the new support zone in this currency. It’s shaping up to be another strong 
year for the Swiss Franc in 2026. 
In summary, position traders may buy the Swiss Franc as long as it remains above 1.1950 on a 
closing basis.

 BITCOIN IN 2026
by Raymond Merriman
“Never sell your Bitcoin,” 
—President Donald Trump, “Full Text of Trump’s Speech at the Bitcoin Conference,” 
The Block Beats, July 27, 2024.
“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just 
ain’t so.”

REVIEW AND PREVIEW
Bitcoin had quite a year in 2025. It started with a new all-time high of 109,071 on January 26. It 
then fell to a yearly low of 74,445 on April 7–9, a loss of 31.7%. Next, it rallied to yet another new 
all-time high (ATH) on October 6, 2025, at 126,223, which was a double top to an earlier ATH of 
124,480 made on August 14, 2025.
The behavior of Bitcoin (BTC) during the year fit the two special updates I issued during the 
year. The first was issued on May 5 as BTC was trading around 94,000. It called for an all-time high 
to take place around October 2025, +/– 1 month, based on the history of the halving cycle, where new 
ATHs tend to happen 16–18 months later. The halving event took place in April 2024. The high was 
thus due August–October. The forecast was moved up one month, to September–November, based 
on the phasing of shorter-term cycles and geocosmic studies. The price target given for the high was 
up to 150,000–158,000.
After the 124,480 new ATH on August 14 and a pullback to the 105,000 area on September 1, a 
special webinar was conducted on September 14, where my outlook on Bitcoin was revised. Although 
150,000 was still a possible target, it was getting late in the time band for a new ATH, ideally due in 
October now. Traders needed to be alert to a possible double top this late in the cycle, where BTC 
could test and even slightly exceed the 124,480 ATH on August 14, and that is what happened. On 
October 6, 2025, the yearly high in BTC, as of this writing, was recorded at 126,223. 
The combination of cycles studies, geocosmics, and chart patterns worked out extremely well. 
Since that time, and as of this writing in early November, BTC has declined by over 20% and below 
100,000.
Based on these same cycle studies reported in the special update and webinar of May and Sep-
tember 2025, the outlook now calls for a decline of 70–90% in BTC by the end of 2026. A new ATH 
in the first quarter of 2026 would alter or delay this bearish outlook for 2026.

CYCLES
There is not a lot of historical data on Bitcoin to derive any strong long-term cycles. Hence, Mark 
Twain’s adage about “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know 
for sure that just ain’t so,” applies here. We don’t have enough data to have high confidence in the 
longer-term cycles related to Bitcoin. It’s only been around for 17 years.
Early indications, however, suggest the possibility that a 4–year cycle may apply to BTC. 
The all-time low was $0.01 (one cent) on October 8, 2010. After rising to a high of $1242 on 
November 29, 2013, BTC fell 88.5% to a low of $142 on January 14, 2015. This was 51 months fol-
lowing the all-time low of .01 in October 2010. 
From there, the second 4-year cycle began. BTC soared to a new all-time high of $19,458 on 
December 18, 2017. But then it collapsed to a low of $3122 on December 15, 2018. This was 47 
months after the previous low and represented a loss of 83.9%. 
The third instance ended with the low of November 21, 2022, which was 49 months after the 
prior low. Thus, we have three instances where a possible 4-year cycle bottomed between 47 and 51
