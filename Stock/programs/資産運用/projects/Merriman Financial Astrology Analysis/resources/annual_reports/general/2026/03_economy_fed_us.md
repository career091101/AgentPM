From 1978 to 1979, Jupiter returned and inflation roared. Gold vaulted from $207 to over $500 
before the cycle was out, on its way to a blow-off top of $875 in January 1980. Stagflation gnawed 
at real returns, equities staged a 28.2% correction in the DJIA, and oil shocks amplified fear. On 
the world stage, millions in Iran toppled a monarch and proclaimed a religious leader in the streets 
of Tehran, while in Rome (another Leo city), a Polish philosopher became John Paul II (who had a 
Jupiter–Neptune conjunction in Leo on his MC), radiating a moral charisma that would bend history. 
With the rise of charismatic leaders, Margaret Thatcher became the first female prime minister of the 
United Kingdom, echoing the theme of the 19th Amendment during the 1920 transit. Voyager 1 flew 
past Jupiter and gifted humanity close-ups of storms the size of worlds. When the planet left Leo, the 
inflation dragon was being hunted down. Monetary austerity and discipline soon tamed prices, and 
a long equity bull market would follow. In the Middle East, the Camp David Accords were signed 
between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin (who later shared the Nobel Peace Prize). An echo of 
the formation of Saudi Arabia in 1932 was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 by 
militants opposing the royal family. 
From 1990 to 1991, the passage brought endings and beginnings. On October 3, 1990, Germany 
reunited after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. By Christmas 1991, the Soviet flag 
was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time. The lion of empire lay down, and the pride of new 
nations stood blinking in the cold light. For a moment, Jupiter in Leo felt like a benediction—noble 
pride in freedom and a promise of peace. Markets wavered as another crest (July 1990) and trough 
(October 1990) of the 4-year cycle formed, following a 22.5% correction in the DJIA. A short and 
sharp recession followed as oil spiked 165% over four months, and Operation Desert Storm triggered 
the Persian Gulf War, liberating Kuwait after the pride and hubris that led to Saddam’s overreach. 
Gold, now fully market-priced, served as a modest refuge. The lesson was familiar: pride before cor-
rection, and expansion followed by recalibration. Yet the transit’s grace endured in images—Mandela 
(with a Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Leo in his natal chart) walking free, Yeltsin (Mars in Leo in 
his natal chart) atop a tank, and millions singing in the streets of a reunited Berlin. During this period, 
the Yugoslav Wars began as Croatia and Slovenia declared independence. In India, former Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. It also marked the dawn of the World Wide Web, as Tim 
Berners-Lee developed the first web browser.
During the 2002 to 2003 transit, the dot-com bubble had already burst, as the markets formed a an 
18-year cycle trough (last seen with Jupiter in Leo during 1932). The DJIA fell 39.7% from its cycle 
crest in 2000, while the NASDAQ imitated the Great Depression as it collapsed 83.7%. On Febru-
ary 15, 2003, with the Sun conjunct Uranus in Aquarius (humanity, revolt, mass protests), millions 
gathered in over 600 cities worldwide in an unprecedented day of protest against the impending war, 
with estimates of 6 to 10 million participants—the largest demonstration in human history. The U.S.-
led coalition launched Operation Iraqi Freedom on the spring equinox, invading Iraq to topple Sad-
dam’s regime in Baghdad (a famed Leo city whose moment of inception was diligently planned by 
Persian astrologers Naubakht al-Ahwazi and Mashallah ibn Athari to ensure the city would prosper 
and withstand foreign invasion). It came as no surprise to see a prolonged and contentious war. Gold, 
a barometer of fear and geopolitical turmoil, began a powerful bull run from roughly $300 toward 
heights unimagined, and the euro was launched in physical form. During this period, the Human 
Genome Project (launched during the prior Jupiter transit) was declared complete, mapping all the 
genes in human DNA. Also in this transit—and relevant to future transits—the controversial Iranian 
nuclear program was revealed by Israeli Mossad agents. Arnold Schwarzenegger (a Leo native) was 
elected governor of California, reflecting the impact that Jupiter’s transit has on natives (note that 

## Page 73

69
Donald Trump won the 2024 election with Jupiter also transiting his Sun sign). At the box office, 
we saw record success with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and the seed of social 
networking was planted with MySpace. The SARS epidemic spread from Asia—a theme we would 
see again during the next transit.
The most recent cycle, from 2014 to 2015, unfolded with hope and dialogue. On the world 
stage, President Barack Obama (a Leo native) was instrumental in bringing about major triumphs 
of global cooperative spirit: world powers and Iran reached a historic nuclear agreement (July 14, 
2015) to curb Iran’s nuclear program; nearly 200 countries adopted the Paris Agreement on cli-
mate change; and the United States and Cuba announced a thaw in relations, ending over 50 years 
of Cold War–era estrangement. The theme of the civil rights movement of 1955 echoed in the 
slogan “Black Lives Matter.” During the transit, the 50-day Gaza War erupted between Israel and 
Hamas, and Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine amid the Donbas 
war—both themes that remain ongoing. In Africa, the Ebola epidemic peaked, echoing the SARS 
outbreak of the previous transit. Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage by 
popular vote, just as gay marriage was also legalized in the United States—a landmark civil rights 
expansion. In the markets, the DJIA formed its 4-year cycle crest and trough after a 16.2% correc-
tion. Gold, having peaked in 2011, was still in a grinding bear market that ultimately saw a 45.7% 
correction end in December 2015. 
Across more than a century, the rhythm is unmistakable. Jupiter in Leo magnifies confidence, 
and confidence drives markets, art, and politics to their limits. Across the past ten transits, we have 
seen five instances of a 4-year cycle crest form in the equity markets and seven instances of a 4-year 
cycle trough, two of which were also 18-year cycle troughs (1932 and 2002). We are currently in the 
time band for the 18-year cycle trough, which means the upcoming Jupiter transit from June 30, 2026, 
until July 26, 2027, remains a key period in which history may repeat itself. Based on this study, there 
is a 50% chance that a 4-year cycle crest will form during this period. In the remaining five cases 
where the crest did not form with Jupiter in Leo, it formed with Jupiter in Aries–Gemini. Given that 
we know the current cycle is forming crests beyond the historical pattern, this increases the likelihood 
of a crest forming during this period. The sample also provides a 70% probability of a 4-year cycle (or 
greater) trough forming during the same period. Of the five cases where the crest formed with Jupiter 
in Leo, three of them (60%) also formed a trough in the same period. 
In its relatively shorter free-market existence, Gold also tends to rally during Jupiter’s tran-
sits through Leo. As we have seen in past transits, despite being fixed, the demand for Gold often 
unhinged the global system. 
In its even shorter existence, Bitcoin has experienced only one Jupiter-in-Leo transit, during 
which it formed a 4-year cycle trough in January 2015, having dropped 86.8% over 14 months from 
its crest in November 2013. Therefore, I am looking for Bitcoin to form a 4-year cycle trough during 
this period.
Prior transits have shown a pattern of transitions in leadership as charismatic figures took the 
torch of power. Every transit has revealed the rise and fall of leaders, dynasties, and even empires. 
Therefore, this transit marks a changing of the guard—whether through elections, revolutions, war, 
or deaths—as leadership itself is in the spotlight. As such, national pride, power politics, and conflict 
will go hand in hand and most often result in war, military campaigns, or their conclusion.

Post–World War II, the focus appears to be on the Middle East, with a strong correlation to 
geopolitical turmoil in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. It is also interesting to note that many Jupiter 
transits of Leo are accompanied by major earthquakes in Iran, within an orb of six to nine months. 
They have also brought about waves of protests for liberal rights, especially among those marginal-
ized in society, demanding greater equality and representation—such as women’s suffrage (1920), 
the civil rights movements of 1955 and 1968, and the LGBT movement in 2014. We often see a 
cultural renaissance in entertainment and art. We also see breakthroughs in science and technology 
(Leo–Aquarius axis). Most importantly, no matter what is happening, the world finds an opportunity 
to party.
Over the past century, every single Jupiter-in-Leo transit has aligned with active or preparatory 
U.S. military operations, ranging from regional interventions to world wars. These include the U.S. 
“Banana Wars” of 1907; post–World War I occupations and the Russian intervention of 1919–20; the 
1931–32 military interventions in Latin America (Nicaragua and Haiti); the peak phase of World War 
II during 1943–44; the Vietnam War in 1955 and its continuation through the 1966–68 Tet Offen-
sive; NATO modernization and covert operations in Afghanistan during 1978–79 (Operation Cyclone 
financing, arming, and training the Mujahideen); the 1990–91 Gulf War; the 2002–03 Iraq War and 
War on Terror in Afghanistan; and the 2014–15 ISIS campaign across Iraq and Syria. 
Leo represents authority, pride, and the guardianship of power. Jupiter magnifies whatever it 
touches, turning confidence into destiny and purpose into conviction. Under this influence, national 
pride expands, moral justification strengthens, and the belief in a global or divine mission takes 
hold. Just as the lion defends its pride with strength and devotion, the United States lifts the torch of 
democracy and liberation, often entering military engagements with a sense of higher calling. What 
begins as guardianship can become assertion, as the light of virtue merges with the fire of ambition 
and hubris. This is a remarkable pattern that is likely to repeat, especially given the themes of the 
preceding chapters—Saturn in Aries, Uranus in Gemini, Neptune in Aries, and Pluto in Aquarius. 
Shortly after its ingress into Leo, Jupiter will oppose Pluto in the summer of 2026. As the Sun trans-
lates this aspect in late July (the lunations of July 29 or August 12 are important +/− 3 days), or as 
Mars translates it later in the year (October 3 to November 15), we could see an explosive manifesta-
tion of this pattern.
During the past ten cycles, a subtle yet persistent pattern of epidemics, pandemics, or significant 
public health crises within an orb of one year on either side of the transit has been noted. This pattern 
is relevant, as it also relates to the Saturn–Neptune conjunction taking place in 2026. In 1907–08, 
we saw the Typhoid Health Reforms, tuberculosis campaigns, and cholera and plague outbreaks in 
India, Egypt, and China. In 1919–20, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world. In 1931–32, we 
faced global malnutrition and disease linked to the Great Depression, including famine-related epi-
demics in Iran and China. The 1943–44 transit brought World War II epidemics and the mass produc-
tion of penicillin. In 1955–56, the polio vaccine went global, and the Asian flu pandemic began. In 
1966–68, the Hong Kong flu pandemic emerged while smallpox eradication intensified—and was 
finally achieved during the 1978–79 transit. In 1990–91, we saw the cholera pandemic; in 2002–03, 
the SARS outbreak; and in 2014–15, the Ebola epidemic and MERS outbreak. We can see a clear 
correlation between major outbreaks and breakthroughs in disease control.
As Jupiter transits Leo again from 2026 to 2027, confidence and creativity will swell. New lead-
ers will stride onto bright stages. Movements will demand recognition. The arts will surprise. The 

## Page 75

71
young will roar. Markets may glow, and Gold may signal turns in trust. The challenge, perennial and 
practical, is to channel the blaze without letting it scorch. We can widen the circle of benefit without 
inflating the crown. We can build architectures that outlast charisma. The story, then, is a story of 
heart—the heart of a civilization daring greatly, sometimes stumbling through hubris and sometimes 
soaring through genius. Treaties signed and broken, movements ignited and souls awakened, wars 
waged and peace negotiated, scientific horizons widened and cultures reborn—these are the living 
footprints of Jupiter in Leo. The cycles do not repeat mechanically. They rhyme. 
In summary, these are the key recurring patterns that I have identified from studying the last ten 
transits of Jupiter through Leo. Beneath the overarching undertone set first by Pluto, then Neptune, 
Uranus, and Saturn, these themes are the lower octaves through which mundane activity will manifest 
between June 2026 and July 2027:
•	
Leadership and power: Each transit magnifies questions of authority and moral courage, 
bringing dramatic rises and falls of leaders on the world stage.
•	
Creative renaissance: Periods under Jupiter in Leo coincide with cultural explosions in art, 
music, and technology that redefine self-expression and collective identity.
•	
Market inflection point: There is a 70% probability that the 4-year or greater cycle trough 
will form in the DJIA and Bitcoin during this transit. 
•	
Gold as a store of wealth: This transit tends to boost demand for Gold.
•	
Moral drama and collective movements: Mass demonstrations and social awakenings 
surge as people find their voice and demand recognition or justice.
•	
Rebirth through crisis: Each cycle brings transformative turning points—economic resets, 
wars, or social upheavals that renew the world order. The United States has always been 
involved in some form of military engagement during these periods.
•	
Innovation and discovery: Scientific and technological breakthroughs emerge, revealing 
humanity’s creative daring under the fire of Leo.
•	
Pandemics or epidemics: There is a clear correlation with major outbreaks and break-
throughs in disease control.

 THE NODAL CYCLES AND THE ECONOMY IN 2026
“He warned that U.S. government debt is rising too quickly, creating a climate ‘that’s very 
much analogous to the years before World War II.’”
—“Ray Dalio Warns of Soaring Debt and ‘Civil War’ Brewing in U.S.,” Bloomberg News, 
October 9, 2025.
REVIEW
Last year’s Forecast 2025 book provided an outlook for the national and world economy for the 
next few years. It is still useful, as it continues to be accurate. It stated: 
“Based on these Lunar Nodal cycles, the passage of the Moon’s North Node from 28° Gemini 
through 16° Pisces seems to be a relatively ‘safe’ economic period. This time band is coming to 
an end starting October 2025, which doesn’t mean a recession begins immediately, but it does 
mean that the possibility of a recession begins to increase after that.”
As of this writing in October 2025, the U.S. economy has been in “a relatively safe period,” as 
forecasted. However, several signs point to a struggle ahead as various economic data indicate the 
U.S. economy is starting to show signs of slowing down. Employment numbers are decreasing, while 
inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s targeted 2% level. In response, the Federal Reserve 
Board has decided to focus more on the dangers of an economic slowdown rather than on the contain-
ment of inflation. Hence, the central bank has started a new round of lowering its short-term interest 
rates (Fed Funds rate), which will have to be adjusted again if inflation starts to rise too much.
In this chapter, we examine the imminent geocosmic factors that correlate with recessions. 
THE LUNAR NODAL CYCLE AND THE ECONOMY BY SIGNS 
The outlook on the economy is based primarily on my research replicating the studies of the 18.6-
year Lunar Nodal cycle, first introduced by Louise McWhirter in her classic work titled McWhirter’s 
Theory of Stock Market Forecasting (American Federation of Astrologers, 1938, Tempe, Arizona). In 
her research on the business cycle prior to 1938, she found that the U.S. economy often bottoms when 
the Moon’s North Node transits through Aquarius and peaks in the sign of Leo.
This model worked quite well during her research period in the late 1930s. That is, the peak of 
the business cycle had a very strong correlation with the North Node in Leo, and a bottom frequently 
occurred when the Moon’s North Node was in Aquarius. Many financial astrologers still refer to this 
model, but there have been far fewer recessions since 1938 than there were before then.
The date range for cycle lows and highs in the economy has expanded since McWhirter’s work in 
1938. In my formal study of the 14 recessions in the U.S. since McWhirter’s book was published, the 
findings differ slightly from McWhirter’s original work. Instead of an economic low occurring near 
the middle of Aquarius, these new studies show that a recession is more likely to unfold within a 45° 
orb of 0° Capricorn, or 15° Aquarius through 15° Scorpio, as shown in the diagram below.

## Page 77

73
Figure 7: The Merriman Nodal Correlation with Economic Cycles. The rectangle denotes where the 
Lunar North Node will be in 2026, starting at about 10° Pisces and ending the year near 22° Aquarius 
(the Node moves backward, or retrograde, through the signs).
In the study of this nodal correlation with economic recessions since 1938, it was determined that 
“… a recession occurred in all five instances of the Moon’s North Node’s transit between 15° Aquar-
ius and 15° Scorpio.” When you consider that over 40% of recessions since 1938 happened within 
only 25% of the signs, and that in all five cases of the Lunar Nodes being between 15° Aquarius and 
15° Scorpio since then did indeed correspond to a recession, that seems noteworthy.
Yet there were other interesting findings in this study. In seven of the 14 recessions since 1938, 
the Lunar North Node transited between 16° Pisces and 1° Scorpio. That is, half of the cases occurred 
when the Lunar North Node was in a 135° sector of the 360° zodiac. Also, six recessions occurred 
between 16° Pisces and 25° Scorpio, which covers an arc of only 111°. Thus, this may be considered 
the “hot zone” for a recession, which is now in effect from October 2025 through August 2031. 
The “hottest” of the “hot zone” could also be considered when the Lunar North Node is posited 
between 1° Pisces and 1° Sagittarius. Five of the recessions have overlapped during this sector of the 
signs, which projects out to June 2026–March 2031 in current time. 

## Page 78

74
There are other geocosmic factors that can help narrow down this time band. The Saturn–Neptune 
conjunction, for instance, has correlated with major recessions in the U.S. either during or shortly 
after (within one year) their conjunction. This 36-year cycle is again underway from the summer of 
2025 through February 2026. If history repeats itself, we could expect a recession to unfold sometime 
between 2026 and the end of 2027. As one can see, this overlaps the time band of the Lunar North 
Node transiting in our “hot zone” for a recession, as discussed above.
It is also quite possible there will be more than one recession during this hot zone period (July 
2026–March 2031), as this time band will coincide with the balsamic phase of the Saturn–Uranus 
cycle. The balsamic phase of a planetary cycle covers the last 45° (waning semi-square) and is asso-
ciated with a time when the dynamics of the cycle are usually in conflict. It is a time when the col-
lective realizes something is coming to an end. Matters of importance just aren’t working anymore, 
and something new has to begin. It’s a Pluto-like period, even though Pluto is not involved in the 
Saturn–Uranus balsamic period. But, as shown in the prior chapter, transiting Pluto at 3°–7° Aquarius 
is intensely involved with the Sun–Moon opposite Uranus in the Chart of Mankind (3°–7° of the 
fixed signs Taurus–Scorpio).
Historically, the balsamic phase of the Saturn–Uranus cycle has relevance to the world and 
national economy, as multiple recessions often happen in this relatively short period, especially when 
near the onset of the waning semi-square. Saturn and Uranus will be in their last 45° waning semi-
square phase from April 12, 2027, through January 12, 2028, though the entire balsamic period will 
last until summer 2032, when the two planets conjoin each other. The economy tends to struggle 
slightly before and during the semi-square time, but usually recovers smartly by the arrival of the 
conjunction, which will take place on June 28, 2032. 
As described in last year’s book, “… the last two times these two planets were in their waning 
semi-square aspect to one another were 1981-1982 and 1937. These were painful secondary reces-
sions to the even more serious recession depths of 1974 and 1932, respectively. The economy strug-
gled during these periods but then recovered sharply going into—or coming out of—the conjunction. 
I expect the same this time, given the overlap of these cycles in 2026-2031.” But the point remains 
that there may be more than one recession during this five-year period, as there were in the balsamic 
phases of 1981–1988 and 1937–1942.
Last year’s book also highlighted a third geocosmic cycle related to the economy of the near 
future: the Jupiter–Saturn cycle. Here is how that cycle works. The economy and global stock market 
cycles tend to perform well within one year of the 20-year conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn. 
Then, as they approach their waxing semi-square two to three years later, there is a financial and 
military crisis. This is usually followed by a strong economy and stock market occurring during the 
third through the sixth years after their conjunction. But then, in years seven to nine, there is a more 
serious economic and financial crisis heading into the Jupiter–Saturn opposition. 
In current terms, the Jupiter and Saturn synodic (conjunction) cycle began on December 21, 
2020. There was a financial and military crisis that erupted in 2022–2023. The “growth” part of the 
cycle is now in effect from 2023 to 2026. However, the seven- to nine-year period of an economic 
and stock market crisis is due 2027-2030, which overlaps with both the Saturn–Neptune conjunction, 
Saturn–Uranus waning semi-square, and the Lunar North Nodal cycle described above. They all 
overlap in the year 2027, which is the “sweet spot” for a recession. But these potential events related 
to long-term geocosmic cycles can have an orb of up to one year on either side.

For the year 2026, the Moon’s North Node will begin at 11° Pisces and end at 22° Aquarius. As 
shown by the figure of the Merriman Nodal Cycle earlier in this chapter, this transit is passing out of 
the zone for a “normal” economic cycle and entering the period of “below-normal” economic activ-
ity after October 2025. Investors are encouraged to take these cycle probabilities into account when 
adjusting their portfolios over the next year. 
In my opinion, it will be wise to start building up cash and deleveraging from assets that cannot 
be liquidated quickly or that may be subject to severe downturns in a slowing economy that may 
gather momentum as we move through 2026. When (and if) a downturn occurs, those who have cash 
will be able to make new purchases at a heavily discounted price. But there is one thing to keep in 
mind: President Trump has a very low threshold for pain in the economy or stock markets. Under 
his reign, declines may be very sharp, yet they may also be relatively short-lived compared to most 
historical downturns. Most recessions and bear markets in stocks last over a year. But it would not 
be surprising if, under his volatile temperament, he would do whatever is within his power to correct 
any serious flash crashes within just a few months, even weeks. 
Plan your selling and repurchasing strategies accordingly, but by all means, plan to have cash 
on hand between 2026 and 2028 to take advantage of such “flash crashes” if they arise, as I believe 
they will.

﻿THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD:
A FIGHT FOR CONTROL
RE VIEW AND PREVIEW
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says the U.S. job market is much weaker than initially believed. 
More than 900,000 fewer jobs were added in 2024 and 2025 than previously reported. The BLS 
issues revisions every year, but this change is the biggest on record and comes after President 
Trump fired the BLS commissioner after a weak monthly jobs report.
—Geoff Bennett, “Revised Job Numbers Raise New Concerns About Economic Slow-
down,” PBS NewsHour, YouTube, September 9, 2025.
Last year’s Forecast 2025 book correctly identified major challenges the Federal Reserve Board 
would encounter with the U.S. government. It stated, “Saturn (on the MC) is the demand, and Nep-
tune is the impracticality, the unrealism of the expectations to be met. Hampering the Fed at the same 
time is the fact that the Saturn–Neptune conjunction squares the Fed’s Sun. It’s not sure what to do. 
The Sun is the Chair of the Fed. If things go wrong, he is especially vulnerable to being a scapegoat, 
the person blamed. The Saturn–Neptune also squares Pluto in the 12th house of hidden enemies, of 
those who are doing reputational harm for a hidden agenda. So, we may have a case where someone, 
or some entity, is slandering the Fed or its Chair as part of a maneuver to gain power and control of 
the nation’s central bank by eliminating the Chair or the institution (bank) itself.”
The book went on to correctly state, “The situation is compounded when you look at the transit 
of Pluto (the terminator) on the FRB’s natal Uranus (independence). It is happening near the 8th 
house cusp, which (like Pluto) has an astrological dynamic of termination. The message here is that 
a powerful force may try to take away the independence of the Fed and do so in a very underhanded 
and deceptive manner.”
And finally, last year’s book concluded, “If a drama unfolds similar to that just described here, 
it will coincide with the bottom of the Aries Vortex abyss. It would be an epic struggle between the 
government and its central bank, probably between the president and the chairman of the Federal 
Reserve Bank…. The Fed needs to be very careful as it enters this period where its reputation, cred-
ibility, and even its existence may be on the line. It will need to fight to defend its reputation.” And 
this is just about the way it happened.
Right from the beginning of his second term, President Trump threatened to remove FRB Chair 
Jerome Powell, even before his term had ended. The only problem was that he could not legally do 
so. Instead, he began replacing Fed governors who resigned with governors who would carry out 
his agenda. He has threatened to fire others and replace them with governors who will carry out his 
wishes to lower interest rates. It is a bold political move to take increasing control of the nation’s 
central bank. Indeed, the Fed’s independence is at risk. In fact, its very existence may be at risk.

Figure 8: Transits (outer circle), February 20, 2026, to the Federal Reserve Board chart (inner circle).
TRANSITS TO ITS FOUNDING CHART
The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. The New York 
Times edition of December 24, 1913, reported that the Federal Reserve was created on December 23, 
1913, at 6:02 PM, in Washington, D.C. According to its own website, www.federalreserve.gov, “It 
was created by Congress to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary 
and financial system.” Basically, it does this by managing two mandates: inflation and unemploy-
ment. Its job is to keep both low, and by doing so, the economy supposedly functions well.
Those two functions are currently in conflict with one another. The labor market has not been 
growing as robustly in 2025 as it was in 2024. Part of the problem was that the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics underreported by more than 900,000 the number of jobs that were added in 2024 and 
2025 than previously stated. The economy and labor market were not nearly as strong as thought, 
and subsequent reports supported that view. Hence, the Fed believed it was more important to 
stimulate the economy by starting a new round of lowering its benchmark Fed funds rate in the 
last quarter of 2025. This meant it was willing to risk that inflation would increase, even though 

## Page 82

78
it never fell to its preferred target of 2%. As rates fell, inflation began to creep up to 3% as this 
is being written. The Fed is now stuck—perhaps confused is a better word—as to what course of 
action to take. Does it continue to provide stimulus to a slowing economy with lower rates, as 
President Trump wishes? Or does it resume its fight to control inflation by raising rates? Or do 
nothing and see what happens?
The transit of Saturn in hard aspect to natal points in the Fed chart indicates times of tighten-
ing or raising rates. Jupiter transits show when the Fed is in a more accommodative mood to lower 
rates and stimulate the economy. Neptune also leans toward lower rates but is often associated with 
poor judgment, uncertainty, or an unwillingness to take any action, one way or the other, regarding 
rate adjustments. 
The Aries Vortex finds both Saturn and Neptune conjoining on the Midheaven (MC) of the Fed 
chart and making a T-square to its Sun–Pluto opposition, while Jupiter transits back and forth over 
its Mars and Ascendant in opposition to its own Jupiter. This perfectly describes the Fed’s dilemma 
as we enter 2026. Jupiter wants to lower rates, Saturn wants to fight inflation, and Neptune isn’t sure 
what to do, for focusing on one part of its dual mandate means putting the other part at risk. In the 
meantime, the power struggle with the Executive Office continues to mount, with Saturn (authority 
and control) in hard aspect to Pluto (power).
Transiting Jupiter will continue crisscrossing the Fed’s Ascendant and Mars, and opposing its 
Jupiter, through May 2026. That is when Jerome Powell’s tenure as Fed Chair ends. However, his 
term as a Fed governor continues until January 31, 2028. Will Trump terminate his role as Fed gover-
nor then as well? The Federal Reserve Act allows the president to remove members of the board only 
“for cause.” In June 2026, Jupiter (exaggeration and overacting) will conjoin the Fed’s natal Neptune, 
the planet of uncertainty and confusion. There is likely to be a lot of confusion after his term ends as 
Fed Chair. It should get very interesting as we approach that period in 2026.
The drama doesn’t end, however, as 2026 finds transiting Pluto (coercion and force) conjoining 
the Fed’s natal Uranus (independence). This aspect comes within minutes of an exact conjunction in 
April–June 2026, before hitting its exact point with three conjunctions between February and Decem-
ber 2027. If the Fed is going to lose its independence, this might be the time. In fact, since an 18-year 
stock market cycle trough is due then—during which the DJIA could lose 35–65% from its all-time 
high—and the U.S. economy is in the Lunar Nodal cycle for a deep recession, the threat (or reality) 
of loss to the Fed’s independence could be the cause of a financial panic around that time. With Pluto, 
reforms and resolutions to conflicts are seldom easy. Yet reform and resolution to long-standing prob-
lems are the explanations offered for why the government has to take such draconian actions. With 
Pluto, change usually comes with a considerable amount of pain to the masses. 
In the meantime, Jupiter (accommodation) is in harmonious aspect to Mercury and Venus in the 
Fed’s chart in September 2026, so there may be another rate cut around that time. Saturn will also 
trine Mercury from June 2026 through March 2027, so there may be some stability then. However, it 
won’t dominate the powerful Pluto transit in conjunction with Uranus in the Fed’s chart, underlining 
the effort to possibly end the Fed’s independence.

﻿THE UNITED STATES IN 2026:
EXCEPTIONALISM VERSUS STATUS DOWNGRADE
American exceptionalism is an idea that the United States of America is a unique and even 
morally superior country for historical, ideological, or religious reasons. Proponents of Amer-
ican exceptionalism generally pair the belief with the claim that the United States is obligated 
to play a special role in global politics. 
—Adam Volle, “American Exceptionalism,” www.brittanica.com.
The past week I’ve talked to two historians, one rightish, one leftish, and both conversations 
turned toward Thomas Jefferson’s stinging bill of particulars against King George III in the 
Declaration of Independence. They resonate in unexpected ways: “For cutting off our Trade 
with all parts of the world.” “He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us.” “He has 
kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our Legislatures.” 
“He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our 
people.” “Obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to 
encourage their migration hither.” The Founders didn’t want any of that. It’s why they created 
a republic. 
—Peggy Noonan, “A Republic, But Can We Keep It?” www.wsj.com, October 24, 2025.
REVIEW OF 2025
Last year’s book, written in October-November 2024, well before Donald Trump’s second term 
in office began on January 20, 2025, correctly pointed out many of the issues that the nation would 
face. 
The book began with an overview of the nation’s military challenges. It stated: “Mars, in a 
nation’s chart, rules its military. In a hard aspect from a progressed planet, it symbolizes perceived 
threats to the nation that could result in the deployment of its military. Is it to defend the nation 
against external threats? Possibly, as Mars is in the 9th house of foreign lands. Could it relate to 
domestic disturbances? That is possible, too, for Mars in the 9th house also relates to protesters, 
especially in colleges and universities.” The book went on to state, “….the president (could) take 
action that may involve the National Guard or military in 2025-2026 …. The progressed Sun (leader) 
in Pisces means the president will try to attain peace. But Mars in the 9th house may indicate others 
are in the mood to resist or fight him.” 
One of the most notable events of last year was the United States’ bombing of Iran in mid-June. 
This was done in order to stop Iran’s nuclear program, which posed an existential risk to Israel. Iran’s 
nuclear program was thus set back several years. Last year’s book specifically stated, “This same 
progressed aspect also brings into play the Mars-Neptune square in the chart of Iran. Thus, tensions 
between Iran and the United States may reach a point of crisis. This may be a time when the U.S. 
military is tested to see just how prepared and competent they are in handling foreign aggression.”
On the economy, last year’s book stated, “…progressed Venus is separating from its opposition 
to progressed Saturn near the cusps of the 2nd and 8th houses and applying to a favorable sextile to 
Jupiter in Cancer. This may bode well for the Treasury.” The U.S. Treasury set a record for revenues 
received, according to the U.S. Treasury Fiscal Data. This should have helped balance the budget and 

## Page 84

80
cut back the deficit. Unfortunately, the outlays of funds exceeded the record revenues received, so the 
debt and deficit continued to increase despite record tax receipts.
Still regarding the economy and financial matters, last year’s book pointed out, “But as they 
(Saturn and Neptune) straddle the Pisces-Aries boundary between March 2025 and February 2026, 
they will form a challenging waning square to the U.S. natal Venus in Cancer. This might be a time of 
financial crisis or a threat to the nation’s central bank (the Federal Reserve Bank). The government 
may be very critical of the central bank and even demand more authority in their decision-making…. 
March 2025-February 2026 may be a very tense period between the Fed and the president.” Indeed, 
there was a brief financial crisis in early April 2025 when the president announced his “Liberation 
Day” tariffs, calling for new and high tariffs on other countries, even America’s allies. The president 
also tried to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed Governor Lisa Cook, as he began making strides 
to insert new governors onto the Fed’s board who would carry out his wish for lower interest rates.
Overall, the U.S. economy did well in 2025 as this is being written in mid-October. Employment 
is still growing, though at a slower pace than the previous year. The nation has continued to assert its 
dominance in military matters throughout the world, but particularly in the Middle East, where the 
president brokered the historic Gaza Peace Plan between Israel and Palestine in October. And ille-
gal immigration into the country is down significantly. These are all positives in the minds of most 
Americans, which relates to last year’s geocosmic analysis.
Yet the nation continues to face many familiar and new formidable issues as it enters 2026. The 
partisanship of politics continues to be divisive and not unifying. The nation’s debt continues to rise, 
and corporations have become reluctant to hire new people and invest heavily in research and product 
development due to the nation’s uncertain trade policies. The new tariff policies are effectively a tax 
on businesses that import and will eventually result in higher costs for goods and services redirected 
onto consumers. The nation is now witnessing the deployment of its military and National Guard into 
several major cities at the direction of the president, and against the will of the leaders and citizens of 
those states. The president has commenced a retribution/revenge initiative against his opponents after 
campaigning on the promise that he would not do so, that his success would be his revenge. But law-
fare has indeed taken over much of the Justice Department’s duties, not to mention absorbing much 
of the daily headlines of news outlets. Protests against the style of government, allegations of cor-
ruption, violations of basic ethical principles, and money-grabbing by leaders of the administration 
are rising. This is leading to increased anxiety about the direction the nation is headed. The nation’s 
populace is in a sour mood as it begins the new year, despite claims to the contrary by the White 
House and MAGA. According to The Hill (October 22, 2025, www.thehill.com), “6 in 10 Say U.S. 
Headed in Wrong Direction.” The number is actually 62%, according to the article. In short, despite 
its success enhancing national security, the nation is experiencing growing anxiety and uncertainty 
about its future in the eyes of its citizens.
Is the U.S. really a republic supported by principles of democracy and a government for the peo-
ple, of the people, and by the people, which has long been the view that has led to the idea of Ameri-
can exceptionalism for over two centuries? Or is it turning into an authoritarian regime where the 
people are coerced into accepting the dictates of the president and his followers without their consent 
or representation? There is even a question as to whether or not the Executive Branch has subsumed 
too many of the roles traditionally belonging to Congress. In short, the question arises: Does the idea 
of American exceptionalism continue to exist? And if so, in what form? Or is it changing form?

With the Aries Vortex in full bloom, each of these issues and concerns is clearly connected to the 
parts of this unusual cosmic configuration. It accurately describes what the nation is undergoing and 
offers insight as to what it may undergo in the next year(s). This is a turning point in the role of the 
United States within the greater world body, as will be discussed herein as it relates to the powerful 
Aries Vortex.
THE CHART OF THE UNITED STATES
“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce 
trade wars,’’ Ronald Reagan said. “The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher 
trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially 
high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the 
worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and mil-
lions of people lose their jobs.’’ 
—Ronald Reagan, as quoted from a radio address given April 25, 1987, written by Paul 
Wiseman, “Trump Says a Canadian Ad Misstated Ronald Reagan’s Views on Tariffs. 
Here Are the Facts and Context,” AP News (apnews.com), October 24, 2025.
As noted in the annual Forecast book over the past several years, I use July 2, 1776. Previously, I 
had also used 11:50 AM in Philadelphia as the time of the founding chart of the U.S. for two reasons. 
First, it fits the history of when the vote for independence was taken, and second, the chart works 
well from an astrological viewpoint. However, no one really knows the exact time, or even day, the 
United States actually completed the vote for its independence. Yet due to the vast changes initiated 
in the United States in 2025, I am adjusting the time of its inception by 35 minutes earlier, to 11:15 
AM. I am rectifying the time to 11:15 AM because that will give the U.S. a 0° Libra rising. Given that 
the Aries Vortex involving Saturn and Neptune is conjunct at 0° Aries, and the Uranus–Pluto trine 
midpoint is also at 0° Aries, I think this slightly adjusted chart with those outer planet placements 
highlighting the 0° cardinal signs on the angles, aligns more closely with the events and changes that 
are occurring at this time in the United States.
The new time still fits within the realm of possibilities as to when the vote for independence was 
completed. We know that the vote—the decision of the new nation to declare itself independent—was 
completed on July 2, 1776, according to David McCullough, historian, and author of the book 1776.1 
And according to astrologer Gary Noel, in a discussion in the ISAR e-zine (www.isarastrology.org) 
several years ago, it is likely that the vote took place before noon because it was announced in the 
evening newspaper. In order to make the evening edition of the daily news, articles had to be submitted 
before noon. So 11:15 AM is still close but before noon, as was our previously used time of 11:50 AM. 
The adjustment in time does not change the position of the planets relative to their signs. They 
remain the same. Libra is still rising, which means Venus still rules the chart, but it is now even 
stronger than before as it resides right on the midheaven at 0° Cancer. This might make the case for 
America’s exceptionalism based on democracy, fairness, and the idea that “all men are created equal” 
even stronger. This revised chart still finds Saturn rising in Libra, where it is exalted, representing 
the importance of laws that are fair and policies that support equal rights for all citizens, which are 
also characteristics that have defined the view of exceptionalism often ascribed to the United States. 
However, these virtues are now being questioned by others both within and outside the U.S. as Saturn 
and Neptune transit the new descendant.

## Page 86

Figure 9: Vote for U.S. Independence, July 2, 1776, 11:15 AM, Philadelphia, PA
There are a couple of other astrological signatures that stand out in this chart, which are relevant 
to the idea of American exceptionalism and its foundation, steeped in the principles of democracy. 
Venus, the chart ruler, is not only on the MC (midheaven, uppermost part of the chart), but also 
conjunct both Jupiter and the Sun in Cancer. This is a very generous configuration, one that can sup-
port the vast amount of foreign aid the U.S. has provided to developing nations or those undergoing 
reconstruction, perhaps after a war or natural calamity. It is a symbol of patriotism and love for the 
nation by its people. It is also a signature of great and enduring success and prosperity, combined with 
its respect for laws, fairness, and opportunities. 
Another aspect that stands out is Mars square Neptune. This is a classic conflict between aggres-
sion and passivity, between the drive to compete and win versus a tendency to pull back and with-
draw. Mars is war, and Neptune represents peace. The nation has a classic conflict between its desire 
to defend itself and its allies, versus its wish for peace and to avoid war.

## Page 87

83
Another planetary setup that stands out is the Moon-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn, in opposi-
tion to Mercury in Cancer. The Moon’s position is only in conjunction with Pluto in the July 2 chart 
and not the July 4th one. I think the Moon-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn is an important reflection 
of the nation’s deep emotional wound and guilt over its history of slavery and racism. It seems to 
be forever trying to heal this wound, but every attempt seems to lead it into more and more conflict, 
guilt, and reproach by others. This configuration was activated in 2021-2024 as Pluto transited over 
it. The opposition to Mercury also indicates the distrust of the mainstream media (MSM) during that 
time, when it had to withstand several insults of providing “fake news” or news that was unfairly 
biased in favor of one political party over another, and not based on objectivity. TV news became 
“opinions” on current events with a political twist, more than reporting of actual news. Many news 
organizations suffered a loss of readership as a result, and people started getting their news updates 
from social media outlets, which led to even false information and a rise in conspiracy theories.
Yet, as stated before, and still this writer’s view, the founding chart given here is a powerful and 
enduring one. It supersedes all progressions or transits, although those two techniques do indicate 
periods of trials, tribulations, threats, and successes. The leadership and exceptionalism of the U.S. 
may be under attack, and it may indeed lose its status as the sole exceptional power on the planet. But 
it doesn’t mean it will fall outside of a leadership role. It just implies it has to share its formerly lofty 
status as the most powerful country in the world with others who are growing in stature more quickly.
THE U.S. PROGRESSED CHART—WAR VERSUS DIPLOMACY 
We start our analysis of the United States in 2026 by analyzing the secondary progressions to the 
founding chart. The date chosen for the progressed chart is July 2, 2026, which would be the 250th 
birth date of the nation.
There is one clear planetary configuration that shows up in this chart. July 2026 will find the 
nation undergoing a progressed new moon, with both the Sun and Moon conjoining at 19° Pisces. A 
progressed new moon represents a new beginning in the life of the nation, especially when it aspects 
other planets in the natal or progressed chart, which just happens to be the case here. That is, the pro-
gressed new moon will be in an exact square to Mars of the founding chart. Furthermore, it sets off 
the Mars-Neptune mutable square in the U.S. chart in a configuration known as a mutable T-square, 
with the focal planet being Mars at 19° Gemini in the nation’s 9th house of education, courts of law, 
religion, trade, and foreign affairs. 
The most important parts of this pattern involve these planets, for they represent the actions of the 
nation, or the choice of whether to act or not when faced with issues that have a Mars theme (anger, 
threats, war). With natal Mars in Gemini, chances are the nation will commence a multitude of many 
new activities. This is further highlighted by the fact that these planets are in mutable signs, which 
means the nation is multitasking—performing several operations or tasks at once. The challenge will 
be to stay focused on one matter at a time, not to get distracted by too many conflicting demands, and 
to do a complete and thorough job with each issue it takes on. The temptation is to spread itself so 
thin that nothing seems to be completed adequately enough to please everyone. Everything is hurried. 
Mistakes and misjudgments occur.

Inner wheel is the founding chart.
To the majority of the population, it may seem like chaos, where everything starts, and then 
changes midstream. In the process, projects of importance seem to be quickly forgotten in favor of 
something new that suddenly demands attention. With the progressed New Moon in Pisces, the lack 
of clarity may be doubly apparent. With the New Moon in opposition to Neptune (the ruler of Pisces) 
for the next three years, the confusion as to what is really important and the risk of losing the plot 
may triple in intensity. 
As stated earlier, Mars in Gemini is the midpoint of this T-square. Mars represents the nation’s 
military might and the threat of war. The founding chart shows there is a natural conflict here between 
Mars and Neptune, or the urge for power and might and war readiness, versus the urge for peace and 
a tendency towards withdrawal or dependence on the resolution of conflict through diplomacy. Mars 
in Gemini can shout and threaten. But with Neptune afflicting Mars, it may experience difficulty or a 

## Page 89

lack of support from the populace to enter into conflicts with others. Hence the slogan, “Speak gently 
but carry a big stick.” So, from 2025 through 2029, the U.S. is torn between entering into conflicts 
with other nations (Mars in the 9th house), versus attempting diplomacy and avoidance of military 
action. The result can lead to great confusion about exactly what is the mission and the means to attain 
its purpose. In some instances, in 2025, for example, the U.S. was an aggressive force that entered into 
conflict and did very well, dropping bombs on Iran’s nuclear facilities and setting their nuclear ambi-
tions and threats to Israel back several years. They also showed Martian muscle in the Israeli–Gazan 
conflict, forcing Hamas to surrender and return hostages to Israel. These were great examples of Mars 
in action, displaying strength in order to achieve peace, which is the positive way these principles can 
be integrated. In these instances, the U.S. garnered respect and admiration throughout the world. 
In other cases, such as the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the U.S. approach has taken a more Pisces-
Neptunian course. First, the U.S. would not support Ukraine in its war with Russia. Then it said it would, 
then backed off and decided it wanted to help resolve the conflict through diplomacy, in which neither 
nation was willing to give up anything. So, what is the criterion under which the U.S. decides to be the 
aggressor versus when it decides to be the peacemaker? Under what conditions will the U.S. defend its 
allies, and when not? No one knows. The progressed New Moon in Pisces is making a mutable T-square to 
the Mars-Neptune square in the U.S. founding chart, exhibiting this lack of consistency in policy involving 
international conflicts. But the New Moon in Pisces strongly suggests that it wants to find a peaceful path 
utilizing diplomacy. Yet that only works when all parties are sincerely interested, which, in this case, with 
Mars as the midpoint of this T-square, is clearly not happening between Russia and Ukraine.
Another feature of this progressed New Moon in Pisces, forming a mutable T-square to the U.S. 
natal Mars-Neptune square, is that it continues to activate the mutable Mars-Neptune square of Iran’s 
chart over the next three years. The conflict with Iran is not likely to end with the June 2025 bomb-
ing of its nuclear sites. That conflict is probably just dormant for now and will come back again. The 
U.S. must be ready.
It is also important to remember that the U.S. progressed Mars is retrograde. That started shortly 
after Barack Obama became president (2008-2009). It will continue through 2087. Astrologically, 
this progressed retrograde Mars poses a problem of readiness for the U.S. military, especially as it is 
in Libra, its detriment. The U.S. leadership will have to be very alert to avoid mistakes, miscalcula-
tions, and dangerous indecisiveness when clarity and firmness are needed for success. It also indi-
cates conducting war campaigns only partway, not seeing them through to needed completion. As a 
result, war successes may have to be entered into a second time with the same actors. The ongoing 
conflict with Iran may be an example of this.
TRANSITS: WAR THREATS, REVENGE, LOSING ALLIES AND TRADING PARTNERS
It isn’t clear if American exceptionalism, as it’s known, is really dead. It’s too early to say 
whether Trump’s moves to reshape the global economy will result in a new world order. The 
U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of some of the administra-
tion’s tariffs. And countries the world over are forging new alliances that exclude or minimize 
U.S. involvement.

It. www.barrons.com, September 5, 2025.
The U.S. is in the midst of a war cycle, both externally and internally. 

## Page 90

In previous books, I noted that each time Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto ingressed into the signs 
they occupy in 2025-2026, the three most important wars in U.S. history occurred. In April 1777, 
the 248-year orbital cycle of Pluto entered Aquarius, just a few months after the American Revolu-
tionary War began. Pluto fully entered Aquarius again in November 2024, where it will remain until 
2043. On April 12, 1861, just one day before the 164-year orbital cycle of Neptune entered Aries, the 
U.S. Civil War commenced. Neptune next entered Aries on March 30, 2025. After retrograding back 
into Pisces, it will re-enter Aries on January 26, 2026, where it will remain until 2038. Uranus has 
an 84-year orbital cycle and had previously entered Gemini on August 7, 1941. Four months later, 
the U.S. entered World War II. It entered Gemini again on July 7, 2025. After retrograding back into 
Taurus, it will re-enter Gemini on April 26, 2026, and remain there through August 3, 2032. As we 
advance through 2026 and into 2027, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto will all be in their first decan (10°) 
of these same signs, where they were posited during the most important wars in American history. 
This is clearly a war cycle for the U.S. Can it avoid a war this time?

NATIONAL AND LOCAL SECURITY 
Almost every issue of importance confronting the United States today can be associated with 
the Aries Vortex, where the Saturn–Neptune conjunction falls on the U.S. descendant and squares 
its natal Venus (chart ruler) on the midheaven. It also pertains to the Uranus–Pluto trine in early air 
signs, which makes up the sides of the funnel, and whose midpoint also falls on 0° Aries with Saturn 
and Neptune. Additionally, transiting Uranus and Pluto make a grand trine to the early Libra rising in 
this newly rectified chart.
Let us start with the issue of trust, an important factor in the status of America’s exceptionalism. 
Trust falls under the domain of Neptune. But Neptune is compromised via its conjunction with Sat-
urn, which is not trust, but rather skepticism, which can easily turn to distrust and even separation if 
one of the parties in a relationship feels that the agreement or precedents supporting the relationship 
are being changed without its approval and consent. Relationships are the key to this current chart 
because the Saturn–Neptune conjunction is on the cusp of the 7th house, which rules partnerships and 
allies. Furthermore, both Saturn and Neptune square the U.S. Venus in Cancer. Venus also rules one’s 
partnerships and allies, those who support the nation and have been loyal to it. 
All of this support and trust has been upended since March, when first Neptune, and then Sat-
urn, moved into Aries, forming these powerful aspects to the U.S. chart. The White House suddenly 
announced huge tariffs on nations that export its goods to the U.S. Aside from causing a mini-panic 
in financial markets in early April (Venus rules the stock market), this abrupt disruption of long-
standing precedence in trade and international relationships has led many of the U.S. allies to seek 
other nations to fill in the gap of lost trade relations with the U.S. It’s not like they completely stopped 
trading with the U.S., for developing new alliances and trading partners take time. But these changing 
trade relationships are underway as we enter 2026, for many nations no longer trust the U.S. to honor 
its precedents. They fear (Saturn) that abrupt, non-consensual changes can and will happen again, and 
in many cases, may be due to some act or statement on their part that personally offends the President. 
This is perhaps the leading reason why America is losing its status of exceptionalism in the eyes of 
the world. It takes a long time to build up trust. It takes only a moment to break it. Without trust, you 
do not have the foundation for a healthy relationship. America has now jeopardized its relationship 
with many of its historic allies. It will be interesting to see if it can recapture that trust before those 
other nations develop new trading alliances.
The consequences of these heavy-handed unilateral trade decisions have also led the charge for 
the currencies of other multinational alliances (like BRICS) to compete with the U.S. Dollar as an 
acceptable standard world currency for trade. Again, this relates to the nation’s Venus being besieged 
by Saturn and Neptune. Venus represents a nation’s currency, and the U.S. Dollar has been falling in 
value as of January 2025. It has declined to a new 3-year low as of this writing.
Despite these challenges indicated by Saturn and Neptune, the transits of Uranus and Pluto, 
making a grand trine with this revised U.S. Ascendant, hold much promise. The U.S. is still a world 
leader in technology and innovation. With Uranus transiting back to its natal sign of Gemini, this 
techno-renaissance is likely to continue. More discoveries and new applications with technology 
are forecasted throughout this decade, and especially in 2026. However, Uranus in Gemini has also 
corresponded to deadly wars for the U.S. in every past instance. Technology and innovation have led 
to economic booms, but in many cases, these discoveries and applications were brought about due 
to war entanglements. This might actually help the U.S. in its military campaigns, but there is still 

## Page 92

88
the issue of a progressed Mars retrograde, which points out the tendency to not end these conflicts 
completely, but rather just conduct a temporary “shock and awe” strike, followed by a break that lets 
the nation’s adversaries regroup to fight another day.
The nation’s economy might continue to hold up and even improve somewhat while transiting 
Jupiter is in Cancer, where the U.S. natal Sun, Venus, and Jupiter are located. It has already passed 
those natal planets as of August 2025, which could mean the peak of the economy has passed. How-
ever, Jupiter will still conjoin Mercury from October 2025 through June 2026. During the early 
stretch of that time, Jupiter will also trine Saturn, from October 2025 to January 2026. This may be a 
secondary economic peak.
New challenges begin to arise as Saturn advances past Neptune in Aries. It will move from its 
square to Venus to a waning square to the U.S. Jupiter and Sun for about one year, starting in March 
2026. This portends new struggles with the economy, world trade, and the leadership of the country 
(Sun), losing the support of its citizenry. The White House believes it will retain control of the House 
and Senate as it has worked hard to redraw voting districts in order to enhance its chances of gaining 
seats. But Saturn will square the nation’s Cancer planets, and Jupiter, leaving its Sun sign during next 
year’s election season, does not support that belief. With Neptune on the descendant, square natal 
Venus, a ploy to interrupt the normal election process cannot be ruled out. Accusations of cheating or 
stealing are likely to be made again.
In conclusion, it appears the United States starts out the year on a strong footing, but not as 
strong as it was prior to August 2025. But as the first quarter of 2026 ends, it also appears that ten-
sions increase with regard to both the economy, trading partners, and the overall direction of the 
U.S. leadership. The U.S. mid-term elections of 2026 hold the potential of another bout of national 
anxiety, division, and allegations of fraud, stealing, and cheating. Such is the lot of Neptune and 
Saturn, prominent as transits in hard aspect to critical points in the U.S. founding chart. At the same 
time, the U.S. is on track to make major advancements in technology and space exploration. It’s not 
as if everything is in decline. Some matters are improving and doing quite well, especially in these 
areas. One other area of concern may be health matters. In this regard, it is not just the U.S., but many 
other nations of the world that need to be alert to the possibility of new contagions erupting under the 
Saturn–Neptune conjunction.

 THE U.S. PRESIDENT IN 2026:
LEGENDARY HERO OR CORRUPT GRIFTER?
Today marked an extraordinary inflection point in time for the Middle East as President Don-
ald Trump signed the historic Gaza Peace Deal alongside world leaders. President Trump’s 
strategy of ‘peace through strength’ brokered a historic peace agreement that stands to bring to 
an end a conflict that has ravaged the Middle East and perpetuated the spread of terrorism… 
Their work, under the leadership of President Trump, represents the most significant peace

“Speak softly but carry a big stick. You will go far.” If Roosevelt were alive today, he might 
caution our current government not to forget the “speak softly” part. As he defined it, it is nec-
essary to be respectful toward all people and scrupulously refrain from wronging them. While 
at the same time keeping ourselves in position to prevent wrong being done to us.

Writing about President Donald Trump is a challenge, no matter how objective one may try to 
be. If his accomplishments are noted in a positive light, far-left partisans will charge you with being a 
MAGA (Trump-supporting) extremist. If you point out his ill-advised decisions and potentially harm-
ful actions to the nation or the world, you are afflicted by TDS—Trump Derangement Syndrome—
according to MAGA extremists. “Ill-advised decisions and actions” is probably an incorrect phrase, 
anyway, for the president has many advisors who try to give him good advice. However, he often acts 
without their input or consent. He creates many problems that did not exist and that only he can solve. 
True to his Gemini cosmic heritage, he plays the roles of villain and then hero.
Thus, as challenging as it is to write this section of the book as someone without bias and subjec-
tivity, I will nevertheless attempt to do so.
THE NATAL CHART
According to published copies of his birth certificate, Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, 
at 10:54 AM, in Queens, NY. 
He was born under a powerful lunar eclipse with the Sun conjunct Uranus in Gemini and the Moon 
in Sagittarius. He has been called a genius and unorthodox, which are traits associated with the Sun and 
Uranus in Gemini. But he has also been called chaotic and a disruptor, which are also terms associated with 
this combination. The Moon in Sagittarius has a very large vision of what is possible and, with the Sun in 
opposition, can indicate unbridled confidence in himself and an unwavering demand of loyalty from oth-
ers to serve that vision, and even himself as a leader. He wishes complete freedom in whatever he does. 
He was also born with Mars conjunct the Ascendant in Leo. In fact, his late Leo rising is conjunct 
Regulus, the fixed star of “royalty and the height of power and wealth.” Is it any wonder that he is 
often accused of “acting like a king?” But with Mars there as well, he will oftentimes act impulsively, 
do what he wants, and not take the time or effort to follow any protocol or normal procedure.

In fact, there is nothing “normal” about Mars on the Leo Ascendant, and the ruler (the Sun) is 
conjunct Uranus. He is unique, different, and unconventional. However, this is not an arrangement that 
astrologers would consider “stable.” It is highly energetic and dominant (Mars rising in a fire sign), 
original (Uranus pronounced), and capable of great deeds. It is also capable of disruptions, chaos, and 
a lack of focus to complete any task that takes too much time before getting distracted and pivoting to 
another matter of new importance. Each task must be done quickly and immediately. There is a bent 
toward overconfidence and arrogance that fosters either unconditional loyalty or intense dislike. People 
tend to either love, worship, despise, or hate him. But very few are without a bias one way or the other. 
His legacy in life may end up being one of greatness, but it may also end up being described as 
divisive and polarizing at a time when the nation sought unity.

SYNASTRY WITH THE U.S. CHART
Comparing Donald Trump’s chart with that of the U.S. founding and progressed chart provides 
an insight that is important to the understanding of current times.
Figure 13: Donald Trump’s chart in the inner circle, the U.S. founding chart is in the outer circle. 
In the prior chapter on the United States, it was pointed out that the major aspect in 2026 was the 
progressed New Moon forming a square aspect to the U.S. natal Mars. This would draw in Neptune 
as well, forming a mutable T-square through 2029. 
Note that Donald Trump’s natal Sun-Lunar North Node and Uranus are in a conjunction to Mars 
in the U.S. chart, as shown in the enclosed figure. His natal Moon and Lunar South Node are in oppo-
sition to the U.S. Mars. This is a powerful combination and describes the president’s role as Com-
mander in Chief. One could say this is his primary role, even destiny, as president of the U.S. His des-
tiny is closely aligned with that of the U.S. military. In this setup, he may serve well as Commander 
in Chief in times of military threats if he acts decisively. Or it could also mean that he is conflicted as

to when to use force versus diplomacy, when to attack versus when to retreat. The tendency may be 
to attack fast and furious at first (Mars), and then to offer an olive branch just as quickly as the strike 
ends (Neptune). With his Sun-Uranus in Gemini in conjunction with the nation’s Mars, he may not 
be consistent or predictable in how he reacts to military threats. That could prove to be an advantage 
in war that leads to victory, and this chart leans towards victories as the combinations just outlined 
in Gemini also make a favorable sextile to his natal Mars in Leo on the fixed star Regulus. His Sun-
Uranus conjunction (on the U.S. Mars) also trines natal Jupiter in Libra. These same signatures also 
point to a dilemma between the urge to fight and win (Mars in Leo rising), versus the urge for diplo-
macy, agreement, and peace (Jupiter in Libra, trine the natal Sun). Is his destiny to be a war hero or a 
peacemaker? It appears it can be both.
President Trump’s Sun-Uranus on the U.S. Mars also relates to his use of the military for untra-
ditional roles beyond defending against enemies outside the borders. He has called up the military to 
help defend the borders against illegal immigration, as well as deploying troops into major cities to 
contain violence, even against the wishes of the leaders of those states. However, he has been accused 
of creating false narratives of uncontrolled urban violence to justify his unpopular deployment of the 
military in response to protests and violent civilian unrest. 
This brings into play the role of Neptune, where one’s claims may either be misunderstood or 
intentionally deceptive and manipulative. It begs the question: What is the real purpose of using the 
military against U.S. citizens? Is it to protect innocent people from domestic terrorism, as the admin-
istration claims? Or is there some other reason, such as setting the stage for the declaration of martial 
law? With Neptune, silence can be golden. Or it can be a way to avoid disclosing the truth that others 
seek in order to make an informed decision. With Neptune, one may never really know the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
Thus, what is most interesting is that the progressed New Moon of the U.S. is at 19° Pisces (see 
chart in the previous chapter), in T-square to the U.S. Mars–Neptune square, as well as to Trump’s 
own Sun–Lunar North Node–Uranus conjunction in Gemini. This is a critical time for the U.S. mili-
tary amidst threats both from within and outside the U.S., and President Trump is called upon to make 
his legacy over this threat of international conflict, and/or civil war within, that threatens the nation 
at this unique point in its history. This is his time, for better or worse. This is the turning point of the 
U.S. as well, tied to President Trump through the nation’s own Mars–Neptune square. The destiny 
and security of the nation and its president are now intertwined.
PROGRESSIONS
US President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the 
White House, saying he would “love to do it”. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Ban-
non said that a “plan” was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term.
—Bernd Debusmann Jr, “Trump Does Not Rule Out Seeking Third Term,” BBC News 
(www.bbc.com), October 27, 2025.
President Trump has a very active progressed chart in 2026, much more active than the transits to 
his natal chart. First of all, his progressed Sun will be located at 9° Virgo in his first house. Being in 
the first house is fine for a leader, but it has passed its last major aspect to a natal planet for the next 
ten years, which suggests his influence may start to wane as a world leader. Not that it ends, but his 
power may peak by the end of 2026.

Yet he has the fortuitous conjunction between progressed Venus and Jupiter in Libra, which is 
the sign Venus has rulership over. Those who surround him love him. It doesn’t get much better than 
this for one’s sense of being approved. But this aspect also squares his natal Venus, which conjuncts 
his natal Saturn, a combination that may make him feel he never receives enough love or approval 
from others. Jupiter’s presence in Libra on progressed Venus reflects “too much.” Saturn’s presence 
natally with Venus suggests “never enough.” The challenge is to define boundaries that others agree 
with and not be over- or under-influenced by the desires of others to affect his decision-making on the 
basis of being “approved.” He may be a powerful deal maker, but with Venus highlighted, he is also 
vulnerable to manipulation by others via his own need to be approved by them. With Venus square 
Venus, and Jupiter also involved, his current world becomes a game of who plays whom? An example 
would be Vladimir Putin, a Libra native ruled by Venus, who Trump acknowledged in mid-2025 was 
“playing him,” or “tapping him along,” by not taking any steps to attain peace with Ukraine as Trump 
had unsuccessfully tried to negotiate.
