  - last_error: RequestBlocked: 
Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hj55Ycg2fA! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking your requests, despite you using Webshare proxies. Please make sure that you have purchased "Residential" proxies and NOT "Proxy Server" or "Static Residential", as those won't work as reliably! The free tier also uses "Proxy Server" and will NOT work!

The only reliable option is using "Residential" proxies (not "Static Residential"), as this allows you to rotate through a pool of over 30M IPs, which means you will always find an IP that hasn't been blocked by YouTube yet!

Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbKn3z2tjK0! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking your requests, despite you using Webshare proxies. Please make sure that you have purchased "Residential" proxies and NOT "Proxy Server" or "Static Residential", as those won't work as reliably! The free tier also uses "Proxy Server" and will NOT work!

The only reliable option is using "Residential" proxies (not "Static Residential"), as this allows you to rotate through a pool of over 30M IPs, which means you will always find an IP that hasn't been blocked by YouTube yet!
