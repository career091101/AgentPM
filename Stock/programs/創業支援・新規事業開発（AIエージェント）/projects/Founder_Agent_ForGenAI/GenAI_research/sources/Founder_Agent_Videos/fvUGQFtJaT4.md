- [00:00] Okay. So, if you're building a business
- [00:02] of any kind where you're doing some kind
- [00:05] of manufacturing or providing a service,
- [00:08] one of the things that you learn quite
- [00:10] quickly is that you need to develop a
- [00:12] set of standard operating procedures.
- [00:15] Basically, this is like a list of what
- [00:18] needs to get done in what order to what
- [00:21] sort of quality. In my 20s, I built a
- [00:24] company that did manufacturing of CDs
- [00:26] and CDRs and DVDRs. And we had a whole
- [00:30] bunch of different SOPs for everything
- [00:33] from the design of the packaging right
- [00:36] through to the requirements that we'd
- [00:37] give the factory when they were doing
- [00:39] manufacturing. And even things like the
- [00:41] cartoon boxes that we shipped all the
- [00:43] products in had to be custom made so
- [00:46] that they would have our logo on it and
- [00:48] stuff like that. The good thing was once
- [00:50] we had the SOPs then it was very easy to
- [00:52] be able to just put in orders and make
- [00:55] the whole thing kind of run itself. Now
- [00:58] in this video I want to talk about how
- [00:59] some of the big companies are now
- [01:01] getting agents to adopt standard
- [01:04] operating procedures for different
- [01:07] tasks. We're seeing this in a number of
- [01:09] different places at the moment. The main
- [01:11] one I'm going to talk about in this
- [01:12] video is something that Anthropic just
- [01:15] announced called skills. But I'm also
- [01:17] going to touch on the claude code
- [01:19] plugins and the Gemini CLI extensions.
- [01:22] In many ways, all three of these things
- [01:25] are ways of giving your agents a set of
- [01:28] standard operating procedures that they
- [01:30] can follow to do the different tasks
- [01:32] that you want them to do. So, I think
- [01:34] it's no surprise at this point that the
- [01:36] quality of your agents and the quality
- [01:39] of your output from any LLM is going to
- [01:42] be about the context that you put into
- [01:45] this. Right? Lots of people have been
- [01:47] talking about context engineering and
- [01:49] really this goes back a few years,
- [01:50] right? These models are basically doing
- [01:53] a conditional probability where they're
- [01:56] conditioning on whatever you put into
- [01:58] them. So the better the quality of the
- [02:00] context that you're inputting to the LLM
- [02:03] or to your agent, the better the quality
- [02:06] you're actually going to get out. So
- [02:08] just like humans need SOPs to reduce
- [02:11] variability, agents need them even more.
- [02:14] And you can kind of think of this as a
- [02:16] sort of core pattern of where you've got
- [02:18] inputs coming in going through a series
- [02:20] of steps having key decision points
- [02:24] using tools having some kind of output
- [02:27] and then perhaps even having a
- [02:28] verification at the end to check the
- [02:31] output is actually what was supposed to
- [02:33] be produced. So if we jump into the
- [02:36] anthropic announcement, they're talking
- [02:38] here about Claude skills. And
- [02:41] interestingly, this is something that is
- [02:43] not only for the Claude chat online
- [02:47] interface. This is also something you
- [02:49] can use with the API. So it really shows
- [02:52] that they're seeing that this is sort of
- [02:53] like a key fundamental thing for people
- [02:56] building better agents and better
- [02:58] workflows for using the anthropic
- [03:00] models. So what actually is a skill
- [03:03] here? Skills are folders that include
- [03:05] instructions, scripts, and resources
- [03:08] that Claude can load when needed. Claude
- [03:11] will only access the skill when it's
- [03:13] relevant. Now, they've made a bunch of
- [03:15] pre-made skills for things like working
- [03:17] with Excel files, creating
- [03:19] presentations, formatting documents, and
- [03:21] stuff like that. And if you think about
- [03:24] it, you can look at this as part of the
- [03:26] original MCP spec. Most people focus on
- [03:29] MCPs purely as API calls or data
- [03:33] ingestion, but there's a third thing in
- [03:36] there for context of sort of prompts and
- [03:39] being able to access and pull back
- [03:41] prompts to go into the model context. In
- [03:44] many ways, you could think of this as
- [03:46] making a new way to do that kind of
- [03:48] task. All right, so they talk about how
- [03:51] skills work that basically it will scan
- [03:54] for any relevant matches. Now, they
- [03:56] don't tell us how they're doing this,
- [03:58] whether this is done with some kind of
- [04:00] similarity check between what you type
- [04:02] in and what your skills are called, etc.
- [04:06] But they do tell us that the skills are
- [04:08] composable, that they can stack
- [04:10] together, that they're portable, so that
- [04:12] once you've got them, you can use them
- [04:14] not only in the sort of Claude apps, but
- [04:17] you can use them in Claude code, you can
- [04:18] use them with the API as well. And
- [04:21] clearly they've put a bit of effort into
- [04:23] how Claude is going to actually decide
- [04:26] which skill to use by talking about that
- [04:28] these only get loaded when they're
- [04:31] actually needed. So if you come into the
- [04:33] Claude settings, you can actually go to
- [04:35] the capabilities and they've got a bunch
- [04:38] of these already pre-made there. And one
- [04:40] of them is a skill creator. So this is
- [04:43] kind of cool that they've got a skill to
- [04:46] actually help you make skills. And so
- [04:48] the skill creator, it's basically its
- [04:50] job is to help you provide interactive
- [04:52] guidance for you to design a workflow,
- [04:56] design something, and then it's going to
- [04:58] work out that folder structure and
- [05:01] create what they call the skill MD file.
- [05:03] So that's going to be one of the key
- [05:05] things that sort of directs what the
- [05:06] actual steps will be, what the syntax
- [05:09] will be, any how it's going to use any
- [05:11] tools. And in many ways, this is kind of
- [05:13] similar to things that we've seen with
- [05:15] coding for quite a while, right? We've
- [05:17] had things like agents.md
- [05:20] cursor has had their own sort of custom
- [05:23] instructions. Pretty much every coding
- [05:25] agent now has a way of you sort of
- [05:28] preloading a bunch of custom
- [05:29] instructions in there. So the cool thing
- [05:31] is this skill will actually help you to
- [05:34] make more skills. But that said, you can
- [05:37] go through it and do it yourself. So
- [05:39] like I mentioned early on, one of the
- [05:41] other things that's really interesting
- [05:42] about this is this is not just for their
- [05:44] sort of claude chat UI. This is going to
- [05:48] be available in the API as well. So they
- [05:51] talk about that agent skills, which we
- [05:52] often refer to as simply skills, can now
- [05:55] be added to the messages API requests
- [05:58] and they've got a whole endpoint for
- [05:59] doing that and the code execution tool
- [06:02] at the back to be able to use those as
- [06:05] well. And with things like this, we're
- [06:07] actually starting to see quite a bit of
- [06:09] divergence between the actual LLM
- [06:12] providers APIs. So, we've got all the
- [06:15] main foundation model providers actually
- [06:17] updating how their APIs work to be able
- [06:20] to work better with their background
- [06:24] tools and the tools that they're adding
- [06:26] on to the API that they will run
- [06:28] themselves. For example, the Gemini API
- [06:30] has Google search, etc. So on top of
- [06:33] them talking about this for the consumer
- [06:34] stuff, they've also outlined how this
- [06:37] can actually be sort of used for agents.
- [06:41] And you can see here this whole idea of
- [06:42] the agent configuration where it's going
- [06:45] to basically have skills equipped for
- [06:48] different things and it's going to have
- [06:50] different MCPs that it can connect to.
- [06:53] And you can see here that it's using
- [06:55] back-end code execution to be able to
- [06:57] access different folders in that skills
- [07:00] directory for things like being able to
- [07:03] format documents in a certain way to be
- [07:06] able to deal with PDFs to be able to use
- [07:08] a database like BigQuery etc. And when
- [07:11] we're looking at this, there's more
- [07:12] detail about the actual anatomy of a
- [07:15] skill and of the skill MD file that it
- [07:18] will have basically a name, a
- [07:20] description, and you can see in many
- [07:22] ways there are elements in here that
- [07:24] similar to the whole sort of prompt
- [07:27] layer of MCPS. They have some nice
- [07:30] examples in here of some different
- [07:32] skills of how you can do things like
- [07:34] bundling additional content that can be
- [07:37] used and loaded just when it's needed
- [07:39] and even showing you how this stuff
- [07:41] actually gets used in the actual context
- [07:44] window when combined with things like
- [07:45] tools and other MCPs etc. Now in many
- [07:48] ways this is also similar to what
- [07:50] they're doing with claude code plugins
- [07:52] and what Google is doing with the Gemini
- [07:54] CLI extensions. You want to package up
- [07:57] things as these sort of skills. Now, for
- [08:00] the CLI code tools, that's going to
- [08:03] include things like sub aents, slash
- [08:06] commands, MCP servers, and it's probably
- [08:08] a lot more detailed and intense, but
- [08:11] fundamentally, it's still the same idea
- [08:13] of getting the best context into the
- [08:16] actual model when you need it to be able
- [08:19] to produce the output that you want. So,
- [08:22] it is interesting to see as we go
- [08:23] forward with this, the whole idea of
- [08:25] plug-in marketplaces or you could almost
- [08:27] think of these as context window
- [08:29] marketplaces where people can make a
- [08:32] whole bunch of different things that you
- [08:33] can package up and serve through. And it
- [08:36] also is developing this idea of where
- [08:39] these chat platforms like your Claude
- [08:43] chat, your Gemini chat, your chat GPT,
- [08:46] etc. are becoming full-on platforms that
- [08:49] can host apps and can be able to do a
- [08:51] whole bunch of different agentic tasks
- [08:54] for you. We saw that as part of the
- [08:56] announcement that OpenAI introduced
- [08:58] recently at their dev day for apps. And
- [09:01] one thing to note here is that this is
- [09:03] not just one of the foundation model
- [09:06] companies doing this. They're all
- [09:07] jumping on the bandwagon. You're tending
- [09:10] to see OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all
- [09:13] be moving in the same direction here.
- [09:16] And then other providers like Mistral
- [09:18] and perhaps some of the Chinese
- [09:19] companies sort of fast following with
- [09:22] integrating a lot of these ideas into
- [09:24] their platforms as well. So just to
- [09:26] finish up, I would say go and check out
- [09:27] the Claude skills and if you've got
- [09:30] access to it, go into the Claude chat
- [09:32] and actually try getting it to make
- [09:34] something. Like you can see here, I'm
- [09:35] just saying, okay, take my YouTube
- [09:37] transcripts and turn it into LinkedIn
- [09:39] content. It will walk you through a
- [09:41] bunch of different steps before it comes
- [09:43] to the final sort of output. And you can
- [09:45] see, interestingly, it's obviously knows
- [09:47] what you've got connected that I have
- [09:49] notion connected to this. So, you will
- [09:52] have to correct it and guide it in the
- [09:54] way that you want to. But the cool thing
- [09:56] is you can then take that skill and put
- [09:58] in your own custom prompts. You can do a
- [10:00] whole bunch of different things to
- [10:02] create your own standard operating
- [10:04] procedures for using these platforms.
- [10:08] The platform is no longer just a chat
- [10:09] app. It's really a set of personal
- [10:11] agents that you can use. All right. So,
- [10:14] after I recorded the video, I found some
- [10:16] other really interesting things in here.
- [10:18] The first one is the best practices. If
- [10:20] you go through this deeply, you see a
- [10:23] lot of interesting things about
- [10:25] conserving tokens. They've got this
- [10:27] example of basically getting the extract
- [10:29] PDF out of using approximately 50 tokens
- [10:33] and they talk about using this as
- [10:35] opposed to using something too verbose
- [10:38] in here. I also find it interesting that
- [10:41] if you know how to write code perhaps
- [10:43] writing some code to put in these things
- [10:45] or when you're making it with their
- [10:47] skill for making skills that putting
- [10:50] code into this actually seems to work
- [10:52] more than just writing plain English.
- [10:54] The other thing that's really
- [10:55] fascinating is they've now got this repo
- [10:58] of skills up and that's got a whole
- [11:00] bunch of different skills that they made
- [11:02] themselves. So you can see their skill
- [11:05] creator in here. We can see the skill MD
- [11:08] talking about how it does everything,
- [11:11] what the process is, and we can see
- [11:13] that's reasonably long. And we can see
- [11:15] that they've got Python code in here for
- [11:18] doing the packaging of this, doing the
- [11:21] validation of this, etc. The other thing
- [11:23] that I found really interesting is the
- [11:25] license. For some of these, you'll see
- [11:27] there's Apache 2 licensed, which is what
- [11:30] I would expect this to be. But if we
- [11:33] come in and look at some of the others,
- [11:34] like in the document skills, Excel file
- [11:37] stuff, we see this is not Apache
- [11:39] license. This is strictly copyright of
- [11:42] anthropic and all rights reserved. It
- [11:45] does seem that they're planting a flag
- [11:47] here that they don't want other
- [11:49] providers ripping off these and putting
- [11:52] them into their own take on this kind of
- [11:55] thing. But if you do want to get into
- [11:56] this, this repo is definitely worth
- [11:59] checking out to actually see how they're
- [12:01] doing a bunch of different things in
- [12:03] here for things like brand guidelines, a
- [12:06] whole bunch of things around the
- [12:07] documents, MCP builders, skill creators,
- [12:11] etc. My guess is that going forward we
- [12:14] will have repos of awesome skills.
- [12:17] That's something you could imagine we're
- [12:19] going to start seeing reasonably quickly
- [12:21] where people are actually going to start
- [12:23] putting this kind of thing up. Anyway,
- [12:26] let me know in the comments what is the
- [12:27] most unusual thing you could be using
- [12:30] this for. Do you have standard operating
- [12:32] procedures or things that perhaps are
- [12:34] not obvious? I feel like we've seen the
- [12:36] whole repurposing of content or writing
- [12:38] tweets, but my guess is that there's
- [12:40] probably a lot of really cool things
- [12:41] people are doing that are not obvious.
- [12:44] And I would say also that if you want to
- [12:47] protect your skills, you may want to
- [12:49] consider turning off allowing Anthropic
- [12:52] to train on these skills. I'm sure part
- [12:54] of their goals for improving the Claude
- [12:57] models is to get as many skills so that
- [12:59] they can work out what are the key
- [13:01] things they need to be training the
- [13:02] models for. So, let me know what unusual
- [13:05] SOPs or unusual things you're doing with
- [13:08] these platform agents and where you
- [13:11] would like to see this go in the future.
- [13:13] Anyway, and as always, if you want to

- [13:18] in the next video. Bye for now.
