- [00:00] Welcome to Big Ideas for 2026. We'll
- [00:02] hear from Mark Andrew on the evolution
- [00:04] of AI user interfaces and how the way we
- [00:06] interact with intelligent systems is
- [00:08] fundamentally changing. Stephanie Zayn
- [00:10] discusses what it means to design for
- [00:12] agents rather than humans, a shift
- [00:14] that's reshaping product development.
- [00:16] And Olivia Moore will share her thoughts
- [00:17] on the rise of AI voice agents and their
- [00:19] growing role in our daily lives. These
- [00:21] aren't just predictions. They're
- [00:23] insights from the people working
- [00:24] directly with the founders and companies
- [00:26] building tomorrow's future.
- [00:30] I'm Mark Andrew, a partner on our AI
- [00:33] apps investing team. My big idea for
- [00:35] 2026 is the death of the prompt box as
- [00:38] the primary user interface for AI
- [00:40] applications. The next wave of apps will
- [00:43] require way less prompting. They'll
- [00:45] observe what you're doing and intervene
- [00:46] proactively with actions for you to
- [00:48] review. The opportunity we're attacking
- [00:50] used to be the 300 to400 billion of
- [00:54] software spend annually in the world.
- [00:57] Now what we're excited about is the $13
- [00:59] trillion of labor spend that exists in
- [01:01] the US alone. It's made the market
- [01:03] opportunity or the TAM for software
- [01:05] about 30 times bigger. If you start from
- [01:07] there and then you think about okay if
- [01:09] all of us want this software to be doing
- [01:11] work for us ideally it's doing work with
- [01:15] at least if not more competency than a
- [01:17] human could right and so um I like to
- [01:20] think about like well what do the best
- [01:22] employees do? What do the best human
- [01:23] employees do? and and I've recently been
- [01:25] talking about this graphic that was
- [01:27] floating around on Twitter. It's a
- [01:28] pyramid of like the five types of
- [01:30] employees and and the ones with the most
- [01:32] agency and why they're the best. So, if
- [01:33] you start at the bottom rung of the
- [01:34] pyramid, it's like people who identify a
- [01:37] problem and then come to you and ask for
- [01:38] help and ask what to do. And that's like
- [01:40] the lowest agency employee. But, uh if
- [01:42] you go to the S tier, like the the most
- [01:44] high agency employee you could possibly
- [01:46] have, they identify a problem. They do
- [01:49] research necessary to diagnose where the
- [01:51] problem came from. They look into a
- [01:53] number of possible solutions. They
- [01:55] implement one of those solutions and
- [01:56] then they keep you in the loop or they
- [01:58] come to you at the very last minute and
- [01:59] say like, do you approve of this
- [02:00] solution I found? And that's what I
- [02:01] think the future of AI apps will be. And
- [02:03] I think that's what everyone wants and
- [02:04] that's what we're all working toward. So
- [02:06] I feel pretty confident that we're
- [02:06] almost there. I think LLMs have
- [02:08] continued to get better and faster and
- [02:10] cheaper. And I think there's a world in
- [02:12] which the user behavior will still
- [02:14] necessitate a human in the loop at the
- [02:17] very end to sort of approve things
- [02:18] certainly in high stakes contexts. But I
- [02:20] think the models are more than capable
- [02:23] of getting to a point where it's
- [02:24] suggesting something really smart on
- [02:25] your behalf and you basically just have
- [02:27] to click accept. As you guys know, I'm
- [02:28] pretty obsessed with the notion of an AI
- [02:31] native CRM. And I think this is like a
- [02:33] perfect example of what these proactive
- [02:35] applications could look like. So in
- [02:37] today's universe, a salesperson might go
- [02:39] open their CRM, explore all the open
- [02:42] opportunities they have, look at their
- [02:44] calendar for that day, and try to think
- [02:45] about, okay, what are the actions I can
- [02:47] take right now to have the greatest
- [02:48] impact on my funnel and my ability to
- [02:50] close deals with the CRM of tomorrow.
- [02:52] Your AI agent or your AI CRM should be
- [02:55] doing all these things on your behalf in
- [02:57] perpetuity, identifying not only like
- [03:00] the most obvious opportunities that are
- [03:01] in your pipeline, but going through your
- [03:03] emails from the last 2 years and
- [03:05] harvesting, you know, this was once a
- [03:06] warm lead and you kind of let it die,
- [03:08] like maybe we should send them this
- [03:09] email to to drum them back up into your
- [03:11] process, right? So, I think there are so
- [03:13] many ways in which drafting an email,
- [03:15] harvesting your calendar, going through
- [03:17] your old your old call notes, like the
- [03:20] the opportunities are just endless. The
- [03:22] ordinary user will still want that last
- [03:25] mile approval almost 100% of the time.
- [03:28] They will want the human part of the
- [03:30] human in the loop to be the final
- [03:32] decision maker. And that's great. I
- [03:33] think that's like the natural way in
- [03:34] which this will evolve. I can imagine a
- [03:36] world in which the power user is
- [03:38] basically taking a lot of extra effort
- [03:41] to train whichever AI app it's using to
- [03:43] have as much context about their
- [03:44] behavior and how they perform their work
- [03:46] as humanly possible. These will utilize
- [03:48] larger context windows. These will
- [03:50] utilize memory that's been baked into a
- [03:52] lot of these LLMs and make it such that
- [03:53] the power user can really trust the
- [03:55] application to do 99.9% of the work or
- [03:59] maybe even 100 and they'll pride
- [04:00] themselves on the number of tasks that
- [04:03] get done without a human needing to
- [04:04] approve them.
- [04:09] Hi, my name is Stephan Deng and I'm an
- [04:11] investing partner on the A16 ZR team. My
- [04:15] big idea for 2026 is creating for
- [04:17] agents, not for humans. Something I'm
- [04:19] super excited about for 2026 is that
- [04:22] people have to start changing the way
- [04:23] they create. And this ranges from
- [04:26] creating content to designing
- [04:28] applications. People are starting to
- [04:30] interface with systems like the web or
- [04:32] their applications with agents as an
- [04:35] intermediary. And what mattered for
- [04:37] human consumption won't matter the same
- [04:39] way for agent consumption. When I was in
- [04:42] high school, I took journalism. And in
- [04:45] journalism, we learn the importance of
- [04:47] starting with the five W's and H in the
- [04:49] lead paragraph for news articles and to
- [04:51] start with a hook for features. Why? For
- [04:54] human attention. Maybe a human would
- [04:56] miss the deeply relevant, insightful
- [04:58] statement buried on page 5, but an agent
- [05:01] won't. For years, we've optimized for
- [05:04] predictable human behavior. You want to
- [05:06] be one of the first search results back
- [05:07] from Google. You want to be one of the
- [05:09] first items listed on Amazon. And this
- [05:11] optimization is not just for the web but
- [05:14] as we design software too. Apps were
- [05:16] designed for human eyes and clicks.
- [05:19] Designers optimized for good UI and
- [05:21] intuitive flows. But as agent usage
- [05:24] grows visual design becomes less central
- [05:26] to overall comprehension. Before during
- [05:29] incidents engineers would go into their
- [05:31] graphana dashboards and try to piece
- [05:33] together what was going on. Now AISR
- [05:35] take in telemetry data. They'll analyze
- [05:37] that data and they'll report back with
- [05:40] hypotheses and insights directly into
- [05:42] Slack for humans to read. Before sales
- [05:45] teams would have to click through and
- [05:46] navigate Salesforce or other CRM to
- [05:49] gather information. Now agents will take
- [05:52] that data and summarize insights for
- [05:55] them. We're no longer designing for
- [05:56] humans, but for agents. The new
- [05:59] optimization isn't visual hierarchy, but
- [06:01] machine legibility. and that will change
- [06:04] the way we create and the tools that we
- [06:05] use to do it. It is a question we don't
- [06:08] know the answer to what agents are
- [06:10] looking for, but all we know is that
- [06:12] agents do a much better job at, you
- [06:14] know, reading all of the text in an
- [06:16] article versus maybe a human would just
- [06:18] read, you know, the first couple
- [06:19] paragraphs. There are a bunch of tools
- [06:21] out there that different organizations
- [06:23] use to just make sure that they show up
- [06:26] when consumers are prompting chat GBT
- [06:29] asking for the best corporate card or
- [06:31] the best shoes to buy. And so there's
- [06:33] like a bunch of what we call GEO tools
- [06:36] out there in the market that people are
- [06:38] using, but um everybody is asking the
- [06:41] question what AI agents want to see. I
- [06:43] love this question. um when humans may
- [06:46] choose to exit the loop entirely. We're
- [06:48] already seeing that happen in some
- [06:50] cases. Our portfolio company Decagon is
- [06:52] answering questions for a lot of their
- [06:54] customers already autonomously. But for
- [06:58] other cases, security operations or
- [07:01] incident resolution, we typically see a
- [07:05] little bit more human in the loop where
- [07:06] the AI agent takes first stab at trying
- [07:09] to figure out what the issue is, running
- [07:11] the analysis and serving to the humans
- [07:14] different potential situations. Those
- [07:17] tend to be cases of higher liability,
- [07:20] more complex analyses, uh, that we see
- [07:23] humans staying in the loop and will
- [07:25] probably stay in the loop for much
- [07:27] longer until the models and the
- [07:30] technology get to incredibly high
- [07:32] accuracy. I don't know if agents will be
- [07:35] watching Instagram reels. Um, it's
- [07:37] really interesting, at least on the tech
- [07:39] side. It is really important to optimize
- [07:43] for that machine legibility piece.
- [07:45] optimized for insight, optimized for
- [07:49] relevance especially versus in you know
- [07:53] in the past it was more about hooking
- [07:56] people in capturing attention in flashy
- [07:59] ways. What we're seeing already is case
- [08:02] of high volume hyperpersonalized
- [08:05] content. And maybe you don't create one
- [08:10] extremely relevant article, extremely
- [08:13] relevant and insightful article, but
- [08:16] maybe you're creating extremely high
- [08:19] volumes of lowquality content, but
- [08:22] addressing different things that you may
- [08:26] think an agent wants to see. almost like
- [08:28] the equivalent of keywords in the era of
- [08:30] agents where cost of creation of content
- [08:33] kind of goes to zero and it's really
- [08:35] easy to create high volumes of content.
- [08:37] That's a potential risk around just high
- [08:40] volumes of things to be able to try to
- [08:42] capture Asian attention.
- [08:48] I'm Olivia Moore and I'm a partner on
- [08:50] our AI applications investing team. My
- [08:53] big idea for 2026 is that AI voice
- [08:56] agents will start to take up space. In
- [08:58] 2025, we saw voice agents break out from
- [09:01] something that seemed more like science
- [09:02] fiction into something that real
- [09:04] enterprises are buying and deploying at
- [09:07] scale. I'm excited to see voice agent
- [09:09] platforms expand working across
- [09:11] platforms and modalities to handle full
- [09:14] tasks and bring us closer to the true AI
- [09:17] employee vision. So, we've seen nearly
- [09:19] every vertical have enterprise customers
- [09:21] that are testing voice agents. if not
- [09:23] deploying them at pretty significant
- [09:24] scale. Healthcare is probably the
- [09:26] biggest one here. We're seeing voice
- [09:28] agents in nearly every part of the
- [09:30] health care stack. Calls to insurers,
- [09:33] pharmacies, suppliers, but also in
- [09:35] perhaps more surprisingly patientf
- [09:37] facing calls. It could be things like
- [09:39] scheduling and reminders that are kind
- [09:41] of table stakes, but also even more
- [09:43] sensitive calls like postsurgery
- [09:46] follow-up calls or even intake calls for
- [09:48] psychiatry are being handled by voice
- [09:50] AI. I think honestly a big driver here
- [09:52] is just the high turnover and the
- [09:54] difficulty in staffing in healthcare
- [09:56] right now which makes voice agents that
- [09:58] can perform with some reliability a
- [10:00] pretty good solution. Another category
- [10:02] that's like that is banking and
- [10:04] financial services. You would think
- [10:06] there's so much compliance and
- [10:07] regulation that voice AI can't operate
- [10:10] there yet. But it turns out this is an
- [10:12] area where voice AI actually outperforms
- [10:14] because humans are actually very good at
- [10:16] violating compliance and regulations and
- [10:20] voice AI can get it every time and
- [10:22] importantly you can track how voice AI
- [10:24] is performing over time. Lastly, I would
- [10:26] say another area where voice has taken
- [10:28] off is recruiting. This is everything
- [10:31] from retail frontline jobs to
- [10:34] entry-level engineering roles to even
- [10:36] mid-level consulting roles. With Voice
- [10:38] AI, you can create an experience for
- [10:40] candidates where they can interview
- [10:42] instantly at whatever time works for
- [10:44] them and then they're sent through the
- [10:45] rest of the human recruiting process.
- [10:46] We've seen big improvements on accuracy
- [10:48] and latency this year as the underlying
- [10:50] models get better and better. Actually,
- [10:52] in some cases, I've heard of voice agent
- [10:54] companies slowing down their agent or
- [10:57] introducing background noise to make it
- [10:59] sound more like a human. When it comes
- [11:00] to BPOS's and call centers, I think some
- [11:03] of them are going to see a softer
- [11:04] transition and others are going to maybe
- [11:06] see a a harder cliff when it comes to
- [11:08] the threat from from AI and specifically
- [11:10] voice AI. It's kind of like how people
- [11:12] say AI isn't going to take your job. A
- [11:14] human using AI will. What we're seeing
- [11:16] is a lot of end customers may still want
- [11:19] to just buy the solution, not buy
- [11:21] technology that they have to implement.
- [11:22] So, they might still use a call center
- [11:24] or BO in the kind of near to medium
- [11:26] term, but they're probably going to use
- [11:28] one that's going to offer a cheaper
- [11:30] price or be able to do more volume
- [11:32] because they're utilizing AI.
- [11:33] Interestingly, there's a couple
- [11:35] geographies where humans are still
- [11:37] actually cheaper on a permanent basis
- [11:40] than kind of best-in-class voice AI. And
- [11:42] so, it'll be interesting to see as the
- [11:43] models get better if costs come down
- [11:45] there. And then call centers in those
- [11:47] markets might face a little bit more of
- [11:48] a threat than they do now. AI is
- [11:50] actually remarkably good at multilingual
- [11:53] conversations and heavy accents. Oftent
- [11:55] times I'll be on a meeting and there'll
- [11:57] be maybe a word or a phrase I don't
- [11:58] catch. Um, and I'll check like my
- [12:00] granola transcripts and it has it down
- [12:02] perfectly. So I think that's a good
- [12:04] example of what most ASR or speechtoext
- [12:07] providers can do. Now there's a couple
- [12:09] use cases that I'm hoping we see a lot
- [12:11] more of next year. Anything government.
- [12:13] So we were investors in prepared 911. If
- [12:16] you can run 911 calls and and they were
- [12:19] the non-emergency calls, but if you can
- [12:20] run that with voice AI, you should be
- [12:22] able to run DMV calls and anything else
- [12:25] government related that right now is so
- [12:27] frustrating as a consumer and so
- [12:29] frustrating if you're the worker on the
- [12:31] other end of the phone. I'm also really
- [12:33] intrigued to see more in consumer voice
- [12:35] AI. It's mostly been B2B so far just
- [12:38] because it's so obvious to replace or
- [12:40] supplement a human on the phone with
- [12:42] much lower cost AI. One category in
- [12:44] consumer voice that I'm excited about is
- [12:46] around kind of health and wellness more
- [12:49] broadly. We're already seeing voice
- [12:51] companions take off in assisted living
- [12:53] facilities and nursing homes, both as a
- [12:55] companion for again the residents, but
- [12:58] also they can kind of track different
- [12:59] measures of wellness over time. We see
- [13:01] voice AI as more of an industry than a
- [13:03] market, which in our opinion means
- [13:05] there's going to be winners across and
- [13:08] at every layer of the stack. If you're
- [13:09] interested in voice AI or or if you want
- [13:11] to build in voice AI, I would recommend
- [13:13] you check out the models. There's lots
- [13:15] of amazing platforms like 11 Labs where
- [13:17] you can test both creating your own
- [13:19] voice and creating your own voice agent
- [13:21] and you get a really good sense of
- [13:23] what's possible and what's to come.
