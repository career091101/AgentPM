- [00:00] Let's learn as simple as possible how we
- [00:01] take our workflows from OpenAI agent
- [00:03] builder and actually leverage the chat
- [00:05] kit feature which allows us to take
- [00:07] these workflows and put it to a live
- [00:09] website. So that workflow you just saw
- [00:11] works perfectly now. And I'm going to
- [00:12] show you step by step how to do this as
- [00:14] simple as possible as if you've never
- [00:16] developed in your entire life. And look
- [00:18] at that. It's already going. Welcome
- [00:19] back y'all. This is another video in our
- [00:21] longgoing series here where I'm showing
- [00:22] you how to actually use this agent
- [00:24] builder here. Make sure to check out the
- [00:25] playlist below if you want more context
- [00:27] how we even got to this point. But this
- [00:29] lesson specifically, we're checking out
- [00:31] everything we love about Chatkit. And
- [00:32] I'm going to break it down fundamentally
- [00:34] what ChatKit even is and the different
- [00:36] little puzzle pieces we need to
- [00:38] interconnect to actually leverage this.
- [00:41] Whether this is going to be in a
- [00:42] website, web app, or alternatively your
- [00:44] software. And if you're brand new to
- [00:46] this series on this playlist, we built
- [00:47] out a YouTube bot where essentially we
- [00:49] can put in any YouTube link and get
- [00:51] information out of it. Now, this
- [00:52] specific video was me developing on the
- [00:54] back of a motorcycle in Changangu, Bali.
- [00:56] This is no joke, y'all. We got our nice
- [00:58] little widget here. Nice little
- [00:59] thumbnail, nice little title. To see
- [01:00] that video, just check out my channel
- [01:01] here and watch me quite literally code
- [01:03] an app on the back of a motorcycle. I
- [01:04] went ahead and put on this nice little
- [01:06] whiteboard here the relevant puzzle
- [01:07] pieces that we need to care about to do
- [01:09] this. So, the first one is the value,
- [01:10] right? So, the OpenAI agent workflow.
- [01:12] Chances are, if you're clicking on this
- [01:14] video, you've already set this up. Now,
- [01:15] you're like, Corbin, how the heck do I
- [01:17] actually use this? So, we're good here.
- [01:18] We've done videos on this. MCP, Zapier,
- [01:20] everything we love. This gets to the
- [01:22] next one. So, I have a React app here,
- [01:24] but in reality, we're just going to use
- [01:26] any type of app. The steps and workflows
- [01:28] you're going to see here can work with
- [01:30] any type of app. So, whatever your tech
- [01:31] stack is, your next question might be,
- [01:32] Corbin, what is React? What is a tech
- [01:34] stack? Well, one just asked Chad GBT
- [01:36] what it is. Essentially, it's the
- [01:37] different frameworks we use when
- [01:38] building out our application or
- [01:40] software. It's like the puzzle pieces.
- [01:42] So, for example, if you like making a
- [01:43] chocolate cake, that's your chocolate
- [01:45] cake. If you like making a vanilla cake,
- [01:46] that's your vanilla cake. The
- [01:47] ingredients are different, but in the
- [01:49] end, it's both cake. If that didn't make
- [01:51] that much sense, don't worry. it'll make
- [01:52] more sense later on this tutorial. So,
- [01:54] in addition to the app, we're going to
- [01:55] connect it to GitHub here. The reason we
- [01:57] use GitHub is a ton of different
- [01:58] reasons, but this is what's going to
- [01:59] integrate really nicely with other
- [02:01] softwares that are going to be needed
- [02:03] for this to work effectively. Nice
- [02:04] little bonus point about GitHub here is
- [02:06] that in this tutorial, I'm going to open
- [02:08] source the repository you see me use so
- [02:10] you can use it for free and you're going
- [02:12] to know how to basically you can take my
- [02:14] code. You can download my code for free.
- [02:15] So, make sure to leave a like right off
- [02:16] the bat. After we do that, once we set
- [02:18] this up together, the last thing is
- [02:19] going to be the product or deployment.
- [02:21] So, I'm going to use Verscell in today's
- [02:23] video just so it could be fast. But in
- [02:25] reality, this doesn't have to be
- [02:26] Verscell, this could be Firebase, this
- [02:28] could be AWS, this could be whatever
- [02:30] your cloud provider is because
- [02:32] essentially what we need to do for these
- [02:33] open AI agents to even work is we need
- [02:36] to provide a valid.com or a valid
- [02:38] website link. So, it doesn't necessarily
- [02:40] have to be.com, but just a valid website
- [02:42] link for this to work. And this will
- [02:43] make more sense. And to be honest with
- [02:44] you all, some of you might have gotten
- [02:46] to the point where you have created the
- [02:47] app or software in local host and it's
- [02:49] like not working and you're confused.
- [02:51] Well, don't worry. This is going to be
- [02:52] the major unlock you're looking for. So,
- [02:54] let's go and do this. We have our
- [02:55] workflow. What is the next step? The
- [02:57] next step here is going to be the
- [02:59] chatkit openai documentation. I'm going
- [03:01] to leave this in the description down
- [03:02] below so you can follow step by step if
- [03:05] needed cuz some of you all like Corbin,
- [03:06] I just want to read it. I'm going leave
- [03:07] it in the description down below. You
- [03:08] can check it out. What this
- [03:09] documentation provides is a starter app.
- [03:11] So, I'm going to click this. You in
- [03:13] theory could either use the starter app
- [03:14] from OpenAI or you could use my
- [03:16] specialized version of this starter app,
- [03:18] which both will be in the description
- [03:20] down below. Regardless, don't make it
- [03:21] difficult. This is the repository. What
- [03:23] a repository is is just basically where
- [03:25] we store all of our code. And when you
- [03:26] say store all of your code, it's quite
- [03:27] literally just in folders. Think of it
- [03:29] like dragging a PDF into a folder. Well,
- [03:31] guess what? This is just a code file.
- [03:32] Next, go to whatever IDE you like,
- [03:35] integrated development environment. For
- [03:37] me, I'm going to be using Cursor today.
- [03:38] What we'll do from here is we're going
- [03:40] to simply clone this repo. What you can
- [03:42] do is that when I provide the repository
- [03:44] we're creating together in today's video
- [03:46] is you can simply clone my repo. So
- [03:48] don't worry about it. That'll be a very
- [03:50] obvious link like hey clone my app or
- [03:52] something like that for your chat UI.
- [03:54] What I'm going to do here is simply
- [03:55] click this. I'm going do SSH and I'm
- [03:57] going to copy. You may need to do HTTPS
- [03:59] if you haven't set up SSH. And then your
- [04:02] next question might be well Corbin what
- [04:03] the heck is SSH? What the heck are you
- [04:05] doing right now? You should check out my
- [04:06] other series on this channel. That
- [04:08] specific series shows you how to build
- [04:09] out a software from complete scratch.
- [04:11] I'll literally just title it like how to
- [04:13] build a software playlist. Yash 3 hours
- [04:15] long, but the episode you're looking for
- [04:17] is episode two here of how to get your
- [04:18] app ready for development, which goes
- [04:20] over the implications of what GitHub is
- [04:22] and how to connect GitHub. This is just
- [04:23] fundamental stuff you need to learn and
- [04:25] know for now. Assuming that you already
- [04:27] have a connection to your local
- [04:28] computer, I'm going to copy this and I'm
- [04:30] going to simply clone repo and paste
- [04:32] this URL. Once you do that, it wants to
- [04:34] put the code somewhere. So, I'm going to
- [04:35] hit new folder here. I'm going call it
- [04:36] agent kit. Create. And I'm going to say
- [04:38] select repository destination. It's
- [04:40] going to quite literally download the
- [04:42] code. Open a new window. Once we do
- [04:43] that, we now have our nice little
- [04:45] starter app. Now, the reason I'm doing
- [04:46] this, and you're going to be downloading
- [04:48] my code here from my starter app, is
- [04:50] because get this to work in a nice
- [04:52] little vanilla environment like this, so
- [04:54] that when you take the steps and logic
- [04:56] you're about to see right now to your
- [04:57] real software or web app, or whatever
- [04:58] you're creating, you at least have a
- [05:00] working product that you can reference.
- [05:02] I would not suggest you take the working
- [05:04] software or web app that you currently
- [05:06] have and trying to integrate checkit
- [05:08] right away. Just get it working on a
- [05:10] separate project. Once you get it
- [05:11] working on a separate project, apply it.
- [05:13] Okay, cool. So, what we're going to do
- [05:14] here is very, very simple. Essentially,
- [05:16] we have a couple files that we need to
- [05:17] care about. The example, this is where
- [05:20] we're going to put our OpenAI API key
- [05:22] and then the chat kit workflow ID.
- [05:24] OpenAI API key is pretty
- [05:25] self-explanatory. To get your API key,
- [05:27] simply come into the dev portal, go to
- [05:28] API keys. Then you're going to go to the
- [05:30] top right and hit create new secret key.
- [05:32] Once you do that, simply name the key.
- [05:33] I'm going to call mine burner because
- [05:35] I'm deleting it. I'm going to say all
- [05:37] create secret key. Once you create your
- [05:38] secret key, it should start with sk.
- [05:40] Copy it. Go ahead. Try to steal this
- [05:42] key. I'm deleting it. Then we're simply
- [05:43] going to come over here and paste. First
- [05:45] step is done. Nice. Next, we need our
- [05:47] workflow ID. How do we find that? Go to
- [05:50] the relevant workflow that you want to
- [05:52] integrate. So for me, it's going to be
- [05:53] YouTube chatbot video. I'm going to come
- [05:54] up here to code. Very important step
- [05:57] before I dive to this is make sure to
- [05:58] deploy it and have a published version.
- [06:00] If you try to do this and it's not
- [06:01] deployed, you won't have the ability to
- [06:03] hit code. So there's going to be two
- [06:04] things you notice here. One is going to
- [06:05] be the workflow ID. So this is going to
- [06:07] be the actual specific actions that you
- [06:09] set up. So for us, it was getting that
- [06:10] YouTube video, asking a question, and
- [06:12] then having the widget show up in the UI
- [06:14] UI user interface, essentially the front
- [06:16] end. The next very important thing that
- [06:18] is probably causing a lot of your errors
- [06:20] and why you clicked on this video is
- [06:21] allowing domains. And how do we do this?
- [06:23] There's two things that is fundamentally
- [06:25] frustrating about this part. The first
- [06:26] thing that's frustrating about this
- [06:27] part, if you're familiar with
- [06:28] development workflow, you're familiar
- [06:30] with local host. And if you're not,
- [06:31] don't worry. We're going to get into
- [06:32] that pretty soon here. You can't add a
- [06:34] local host URL here. It just won't work.
- [06:36] You're still going to get errors. So,
- [06:37] I'm going to show you how to get around
- [06:38] that. Second thing, when you add the URL
- [06:41] here, this option is going to disappear
- [06:43] for all workflows. This is annoying
- [06:45] because if you want to provide a
- [06:46] different link, how do we do it, Corbin?
- [06:48] Well, I went ahead and took the extra 10
- [06:49] minutes just to find exactly where it's
- [06:51] found in the settings. So, I'll show you
- [06:52] how to add additional URLs once you add
- [06:54] your initial URL. Lastly, what does this
- [06:57] even mean? Why are we even adding a URL?
- [06:59] Like, is Chad GBT like I just want to
- [07:00] check out your website? No, no, no, no.
- [07:02] This is for security reasons. This is so
- [07:04] that when we provide this code, OpenAI
- [07:06] servers is identifying, hey,
- [07:08] w.corbin.com.
- [07:10] This is a viable area where we can allow
- [07:12] them to use this underlying users API
- [07:15] key and workflow. If they didn't put
- [07:17] this kind of security feature here, this
- [07:18] would mean that anyone could use your
- [07:20] workflow without the allowed domain. So,
- [07:22] it's annoying, but it's a necessary step
- [07:24] in software development. This nuance
- [07:26] understanding this at a deeper level,
- [07:28] which is fundamentally important. Check
- [07:29] out that how to build software playlist
- [07:31] description down below. First, let's
- [07:32] just get our workflow ID here. So, we're
- [07:34] going to copy this. We're going to paste
- [07:36] it here. Nice. Next, we need the allowed
- [07:38] domain. But first off, we need a domain.
- [07:40] So, we're going to do that. In order to
- [07:42] do the domain here, I'm just going to do
- [07:43] a cursor chat to make this simple for
- [07:45] everyone so you don't just see me doing
- [07:46] a bunch of commands. You get lost and no
- [07:48] one has fun. We're going to make it so
- [07:49] we can just completely have AI set this
- [07:51] up for us. In today's video, we're going
- [07:52] to set it up with Versell. And
- [07:54] essentially what Verscell allows us to
- [07:55] do is get a really fast and easy domain
- [07:57] link that anyone can access and
- [07:59] therefore Chad GBT and OpenAI can
- [08:01] access. In theory, if you were going to
- [08:04] actually deploy to a real web app or
- [08:06] software or whatever your backend
- [08:07] infrastructure is, maybe you already
- [08:08] have a domain that's available, so
- [08:10] you're all good. But alternatively, if
- [08:12] you haven't set that up yet, I would
- [08:13] encourage Firebase, which parlays to
- [08:16] that series again, which I show you how
- [08:17] to set up Firebase. Regardless, here we
- [08:20] go. So, I'm going to go ahead and turn
- [08:21] on browser mode here, and I'm going to
- [08:22] say, okay, here is the chatkit UI
- [08:24] documentation semicolon. Go to the
- [08:27] description down below. Grab the
- [08:28] relevant link here, and I'm going paste
- [08:30] it. Once you do that, we're going to
- [08:31] say, set it up so we can deploy to
- [08:34] Versell. And that's all I need to do. If
- [08:36] you're following step by step along with
- [08:38] me right now, some tests might feel a
- [08:39] little skipped over because you may not
- [08:42] have a Verscell account yet. So
- [08:43] therefore, just create a Verscell
- [08:45] account. Not that big of a deal. It's
- [08:46] free. Free to deploy. If you already
- [08:48] have a live website link and you're like
- [08:50] Corbin, I don't need this part. Just
- [08:51] skip back here and just add your domain.
- [08:53] This is for everyone that just really
- [08:54] wants to test this out and have a fast
- [08:55] deployment method that is free. Set it
- [08:57] up so we can deploy to Verscell. Call
- [08:58] the app agent kit. Amazing. Enter. And
- [09:01] we're going to let this proceed here.
- [09:02] What it's going to do is simply go to
- [09:04] that relevant API documentation to get
- [09:06] context on chatkit and how to integrate
- [09:08] it into the front end. In addition,
- [09:09] what's incurring here is that it's going
- [09:11] to create a connection between our local
- [09:12] computer and versel. And in addition
- [09:15] here, we'll create a connection to
- [09:16] GitHub, which is another fancy way of me
- [09:19] essentially saying that this local code
- [09:20] found on our computer is going to be now
- [09:22] in the cloud. What I mean by that is
- [09:24] when I say local code, if your computer
- [09:27] was going to burn in a fire, all your
- [09:29] code's lost. then give it like a
- [09:31] Microsoft Word doc. If you didn't have
- [09:33] that in the cloud, that would mean that
- [09:35] that computer that has that Microsoft
- [09:36] Word doc, if your computer was
- [09:38] destroyed, it would be deleted as well.
- [09:40] I'm going to hit accept here for the get
- [09:42] ignore confirm edits here. I'm assuming
- [09:44] that it's going to be heading the env
- [09:46] file here, which it should be pretty
- [09:48] soon here. It might be renaming this
- [09:49] too. Okay, so I'm going have to rename
- [09:51] this as well. If you don't know what a
- [09:52] get ignore is, this is going to be the
- [09:54] files that are ignored when we push to
- [09:55] GitHub here pretty soon. So, first off,
- [09:57] I'm going to say keep all here. The next
- [09:58] thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
- [10:00] add, you know what? We need to add this
- [10:03] as well. Although it might already do
- [10:04] that with the asterisk, but just to be
- [10:06] safe. You don't understand what I'm
- [10:07] doing. Don't worry. It'll make sense
- [10:09] pretty soon. Here, the app is fully
- [10:10] configured and ready to deploy to
- [10:12] Verscell. The check integration is
- [10:13] already set up and will work once you
- [10:15] provide the required environment
- [10:17] variables. Now, you might be asking
- [10:18] yourself, what is an environment
- [10:19] variable? That is what we set up here.
- [10:21] This is an environment variable. This is
- [10:23] an environment variable. Why is it that
- [10:25] for some reason, Corbin, when I try to
- [10:27] deploy stuff, it always freaks out when
- [10:29] I have these kind of high-risk
- [10:30] variables? And why does it want it to
- [10:32] set it up as an environment variable?
- [10:34] Well, that's due to the fact that the
- [10:35] way this actually reads it in the code
- [10:37] is env.openAI API key. If I come up here
- [10:40] to find it, go like this right here. You
- [10:43] will notice it will render with this
- [10:45] right here. That is why anytime you use
- [10:47] AI in coding, it is always encouraged
- [10:49] never to put the hard fixed text of your
- [10:52] keys so that it isn't public facing when
- [10:54] you deploy to the cloud. This is a long
- [10:55] way of me saying that once this is a
- [10:57] live website link, if you were to put
- [10:58] this hard text into your code file,
- [11:01] someone could essentially grab your key
- [11:03] from the source code. Don't like that.
- [11:05] Now, before we do this, we're going to
- [11:06] actually connect this to GitHub. So,
- [11:08] what I'm going to do here so you can
- [11:09] watch and follow along. So, maybe you
- [11:10] want to create your own little starter
- [11:11] app repository once you download my
- [11:13] code. Just come up here to repo and come
- [11:15] over here to new and we're going to call
- [11:16] it a repository name easy OpenAI check
- [11:18] it app and then essentially I'll just
- [11:20] grab the same description here.
- [11:22] Description is not necessary just for
- [11:23] how we identify it. And we're going to
- [11:24] hit create repository. From here I'm
- [11:26] simply going to do it the SSH method as
- [11:28] I notated. Check out the playlist if you
- [11:29] want to set up that way. But the SSH
- [11:31] method even means is that I don't have
- [11:33] to go through those annoying errors when
- [11:35] you're dealing with code in AI where it
- [11:36] says, "Hey, you don't have access to
- [11:37] GitHub. Hey, you don't have access to
- [11:39] this." No, no, no. the SSH key is on
- [11:41] your computer, which means I can speak
- [11:42] to the cloud in GitHub and never have an
- [11:44] error. Basically, just download the code
- [11:45] and connect your account. From here, I'm
- [11:46] going to say, okay, connect this
- [11:48] repository. Repository is another way of
- [11:50] me saying all this code to this GitHub
- [11:52] repo. Repo is a shorthand of how to say
- [11:54] repository. If you've never coded before
- [11:56] and you're watching this tutorial and
- [11:58] it's either confusing or extremely
- [11:59] frustrating, please take a note that
- [12:02] what you're seeing right now is complex
- [12:04] work. This isn't supposed to be like me
- [12:07] just creating pottery and I just want to
- [12:09] create a ball. This is software
- [12:10] development. So a lot of this stuff is
- [12:12] built off layers and layers of
- [12:15] foundational knowledge. If you want
- [12:17] encouragement of how do you approach
- [12:19] this and not get frustrated, I would
- [12:21] highly encourage you watch my videos on
- [12:23] GitHub. GitHub is the missing puzzle
- [12:25] piece that you probably need to learn
- [12:26] more about so all this becomes extremely
- [12:29] easy. I preface my videos a lot like
- [12:30] that because trust me y'all in the
- [12:32] comments a lot of people get frustrated.
- [12:33] So, I'm really trying to help y'all, you
- [12:35] know, start at the bare bones here, you
- [12:36] know. So, once I do that, if I come over
- [12:38] here and reload, we should see a
- [12:39] repository connected. And there we go.
- [12:41] With that push, you can see it right
- [12:43] here. Now, one thing I want to note and
- [12:44] why you probably want to download my
- [12:46] repository comparative to OpenAI's is
- [12:48] there's little things that their
- [12:50] repository doesn't take into account.
- [12:52] For example, the example, we want to
- [12:54] call that.local.
- [12:56] And that's because of the fact that
- [12:57] you're going to get a bunch of errors
- [12:58] that are extremely frustrating.
- [13:00] essentially saying that we can't push
- [13:01] this because secrets are exposed. You
- [13:03] just got to name it correctly. So, I
- [13:04] named it correctly for y'all. But to be
- [13:06] clear, when you actually download my
- [13:08] repository, this file won't show up. And
- [13:09] the reason it won't show up is because
- [13:11] of the fact that we're ignoring it in
- [13:12] the git ignore. Therefore, in order to
- [13:14] create it, rightclick new file. Simply
- [13:16] do.local
- [13:18] and you'll be good to go. So, now that
- [13:20] we've created a repository and we've
- [13:22] connected into the cloud, everything
- [13:23] from here and out, I don't have to worry
- [13:25] cuz I can always roll back to the safe
- [13:27] checkpoint. So, what I'm going to do is
- [13:28] this. We're going to say okay deploy app
- [13:30] to versel. And what we're doing here is
- [13:32] we're grabbing that relevant link that
- [13:34] we need for the workflow. So once it
- [13:36] pushes to versel prerequisite, you need
- [13:38] a versell account free. You're going to
- [13:40] simply go to where it creates. So I'm
- [13:41] going click this. In addition, what's
- [13:43] nice about using cursor AI here is that
- [13:45] it will install the relevant
- [13:46] dependencies for even to do Versell
- [13:48] commands. On top of that, if you don't
- [13:49] use cursor AI, you can use any chatbot
- [13:52] for this. So that's just a caveat for
- [13:53] this entire tutorial. You don't even
- [13:54] need to use a chatbot within the IDE.
- [13:56] You can use chat gbt cursor. You could
- [13:58] use Claude, you could use Gemini,
- [14:00] whatever it may be. Follow the same
- [14:01] steps, follow the same lines. Over here,
- [14:03] what you'll notice is that we have a
- [14:04] successful deployment. What we need to
- [14:06] add is our environment variables here.
- [14:08] So, I'm going to go to settings. In
- [14:09] settings, go to the tab that says
- [14:10] environment variables. So, what you'll
- [14:12] notice is that sometimes it'll say no
- [14:13] environment variables added.
- [14:15] Alternatively, sometimes the IDE is
- [14:17] smart enough to push them for you, but
- [14:18] in today's example, it wasn't. So, we're
- [14:20] going to add them. In order to add them,
- [14:21] I'm going to use OpenAI API key how it's
- [14:23] named here. So, I'm going to copy that.
- [14:24] You also notice is that essentially
- [14:26] we're just grabbing them how they're
- [14:27] named here as well in your env.local.
- [14:30] I'm going to paste it here and then the
- [14:31] value will be our API key which we've
- [14:33] already identified here. So I'm going to
- [14:34] copy this. I will paste add another and
- [14:37] this will be the workflow ID. Copy this.
- [14:39] Paste. The naming is fundamentally
- [14:41] extremely important. If you do not name
- [14:44] open AI API key exactly how it's named
- [14:46] here here it's all going to break. So
- [14:48] keep that in mind. So I'm going to go
- [14:49] and copy this workflow ID here. Paste.
- [14:51] Save. One thing I want to make sure is
- [14:53] that I'm going to hit edit here and I'm
- [14:55] going to do all environments. I could go
- [14:56] on an absolute tangent right now about
- [14:58] what is preview, what is production,
- [15:00] what is development. We'll save that for
- [15:01] another video or I encourage you again
- [15:03] to check out that three-hour playlist
- [15:04] showing you how to build a software from
- [15:06] scratch to have the implications of what
- [15:08] that even means. For now, let's just get
- [15:10] this working. So, we're going to say all
- [15:11] environments for this and all
- [15:12] environments for this. What you'll
- [15:14] notice is that when you update an
- [15:16] environment variable, we're going to
- [15:17] have to redeploy. So, I'm going redeploy
- [15:19] here. Redeploy. The next thing we're
- [15:21] going to do while it's deploying, and
- [15:22] what deploying means essentially is that
- [15:24] when all the code's good to go, it looks
- [15:26] amazing. Deploying it is taking it to
- [15:28] the actual live website link that anyone
- [15:30] can access that fresh new code. So, for
- [15:32] example, you have a landing page that
- [15:34] just says apples on your local computer.
- [15:36] You haven't deployed it yet. Therefore,
- [15:37] if you go to that same landing page on
- [15:38] the internet, it doesn't say apples yet.
- [15:40] When you hit deploy, then apples will
- [15:42] reflect in the live website link. So,
- [15:44] while this is doing this, our live
- [15:46] website link is this. OpenAI check it
- [15:48] starter kit app for sale.app. Nice. I'm
- [15:50] going to copy the link up here. So, go
- [15:52] ahead and copy the link. I know this
- [15:53] says an error. We're going to fix it.
- [15:54] We're going to go to agent builder.
- [15:56] We're going to say add domain. We're
- [15:57] going to paste this domain. Generate
- [15:59] key. Copy this key. Next, in your chat,
- [16:02] this is what we're going to say. We're
- [16:03] going to put the prompt. This is the
- [16:04] domain key. Then, we're going to give
- [16:05] the link. The link is up here again. So,
- [16:07] same exact link. Paste. Deploy relevant
- [16:09] information to Versell. Hit enter. So,
- [16:12] while we let that generate, one thing
- [16:13] that is extremely frustrating about the
- [16:15] workflow is that if you hit code again
- [16:17] and you're like, Corbin, I want to add
- [16:18] another domain, this option disappears.
- [16:20] So, let me show you how you find it. In
- [16:22] order to find it, come up here to
- [16:23] settings. You are then going to come
- [16:24] down to security and then right here and
- [16:26] then hit add domain. Follow the same
- [16:28] steps. I don't know why this is hidden.
- [16:29] I don't know why they don't give the
- [16:30] option in the workflow again, but now
- [16:32] you know how to add extra domains if
- [16:34] necessary for whatever your workflow is.
- [16:36] So, add domain and boom. So, with that
- [16:38] done, I can keep reloading here. It's
- [16:40] going to load the assistant. It should
- [16:41] be working, but we'll find out pretty
- [16:43] soon here. Let me show you some real
- [16:44] quick debugging tips. First thing,
- [16:46] notice because we're working in the
- [16:48] front end. If you get errors or like you
- [16:50] try to load this and you're like Corbin,
- [16:51] like this is just cooked. Rightclick,
- [16:54] inspect, come over here, hit console,
- [16:56] and this is where relevant logs could
- [16:58] show of like air blah blah blah blah
- [17:00] blah. This is where you would copy those
- [17:02] errors and paste it in your AI chat
- [17:04] essentially to get the information that
- [17:05] you would need. Now, to be clear, that
- [17:07] is how you get access to console logs in
- [17:10] Google Chrome. To get accessing console
- [17:12] logs in all your other browsers, I would
- [17:14] encourage you just to ask a chatbot,
- [17:15] hey, how do I get console logs in
- [17:17] Safari? Because Safari is definitely
- [17:18] different comparative to Google Chrome
- [17:20] when it comes to getting console logs.
- [17:22] What a console log is, if you're
- [17:23] wondering, console logs are ways for us
- [17:25] to have the code communicate to us in
- [17:28] just regular English. So essentially, if
- [17:30] an error occurs, it'll be able to print
- [17:32] it out and give us the ability to see
- [17:33] that, hey, this isn't loading because of
- [17:35] XYZ reason. To be honest with you, we've
- [17:37] gotten to the point now with AI where
- [17:38] you don't even need even know the reason
- [17:39] or need even care. Simply just copy it,
- [17:42] put it in AI chat, and it will know
- [17:43] instantly what to do to fix your issue.
- [17:45] But y'all, I think we've successfully
- [17:47] created an embedded chat kit UI. Let's
- [17:49] find out. So, I'm going to go ahead and
- [17:51] say, give me the best part from this
- [17:52] video, YouTube link. As you remember
- [17:54] earlier in this series, you can check
- [17:55] out that playlist. We created a YouTube
- [17:57] bot. Therefore, we can ask anything we
- [17:59] would ever want from a YouTube video.
- [18:01] Provide the link and our entire workflow
- [18:03] gets going. We get a custom response
- [18:06] based off the data found in that video
- [18:07] of what's the best part of that video.
- [18:09] And then on top of that, we've created a
- [18:10] custom widget together in an earlier
- [18:12] video. I'm saying video a lot. Video
- [18:14] video. But we created a custom widget
- [18:15] that makes the underlying thumbnail, the
- [18:18] title, and the duration reflect in a
- [18:20] user interface that looks very pretty.
- [18:22] So, let's see if this works. The end
- [18:24] product here should be that same Changu
- [18:26] Bali video where I develop an app on the
- [18:27] back of a motorcycle. And when you look
- [18:29] at that, the bot actually went the extra
- [18:31] 10 yards here and gave us the exact
- [18:33] moment on time stamp. And essentially
- [18:34] the moment is the app finally renders at
- [18:36] Fins and he celebrates. We've
- [18:38] successfully created a 3D motorcycle
- [18:39] game in Bali on a motorcycle. Okay,
- [18:42] funny enough, I spoiled it for y'all,
- [18:43] but that is really cool. And boom, it
- [18:45] even popped up with the thumbnail, the
- [18:48] title, and duration. I like it. Now,
- [18:50] before you click off, let me show you
- [18:51] the last couple things here that could
- [18:52] be very useful in your journey and
- [18:54] trying to build this. First one being
- [18:55] check out the school community here.
- [18:57] Completely free to join description down
- [18:58] below. It's literally the one titled
- [19:00] join free community. If you run into
- [19:01] errors here, you need questions, throw
- [19:03] it up here. This is essentially just a
- [19:05] Reddit forum where I centralize a lot of
- [19:07] my teachings over the past two and a
- [19:09] half years. People ask questions, I
- [19:10] answer, other people in the community
- [19:12] answer. Super cool. Another series I
- [19:14] wanted to shout out as well is my series
- [19:16] on not necessarily building out a
- [19:18] software, but building out a website and
- [19:20] the implications of how to build out a
- [19:22] website when it comes to security, good
- [19:24] user interface, and best practices. So,
- [19:26] I'll leave this in the description down
- [19:27] below. Something along the lines of
- [19:29] let's just build a website and the
- [19:31] playlist. For anyone curious on the
- [19:33] website we built in that series, it's
- [19:34] this one right here. And you can find it
- [19:35] at buildersconlock.com.
- [19:37] And then for anyone curious on the
- [19:38] software playlist, the software we
- [19:40] created, it is tubestamp.com.
- [19:42] Essentially, you provide a YouTube link
- [19:43] here. You can choose the language and
- [19:45] generate timestamps for any video found.
- [19:47] That just about does it. We've
- [19:49] successfully integrated Chatkit UI into
- [19:51] your web app or software. Make sure to
- [19:52] stay tuned and make sure you subscribe
- [19:54] on this channel as I'm going to do more
- [19:56] videos on Agent Builder. Specifically,
- [19:57] I'm going to look at making a video that
- [19:58] is going to be file search, PDFs, image
- [20:01] analysis, automations. In addition,
- [20:03] there's a bunch of other cool stuff I do
- [20:05] on this channel here. One really [music]
- [20:06] cool thing that maybe only some of you
- [20:08] will care about is I am creating
- [20:09] Minecraft from complete scratch. zero
- [20:11] lines of code to straight up Minecraft.
- [20:13] And I'm live streaming the entire thing.
- [20:15] Right now, it's day three, so I don't
- [20:17] know by the time you watch this video
- [20:18] what day we're going to be on, but every
- [20:19] single day, YouTube, Twitch, X, check me
- [20:22] out. But as you already know with these
- [20:23] style videos, I'll see you in the next
- [20:25] Wow, you actually found an OpenAI agent
- [20:27] builder video that actually shows you
- [20:28] how to use it outside of the builder
- [20:30] video. Nice.
