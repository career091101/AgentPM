- [00:00] Hey there everyone and welcome to full
- [00:02] stack AI course. The only course that
- [00:05] you need that is always going to stay
- [00:07] updated and will help you to achieve
- [00:10] your goal in mastering AI. My name is
- [00:12] Hesh
- [00:13] >> and my name is Push Girk
- [00:15] >> and together we are going to help you to
- [00:18] master AI and every aspect of it. Every
- [00:21] buzzword that you have heard around AI
- [00:24] you're going to build projects around
- [00:25] it. You're going to understand the tech
- [00:27] and you will in no time be a master of
- [00:30] AI. Before we get started in this
- [00:32] course, I would like to put an analogy
- [00:34] first. There are folks who actually work
- [00:37] in MySQL or Postgress databases and they
- [00:40] are researchers. They day in dayout
- [00:42] works to increase the performance of
- [00:44] MySQL and Postgress. And that's why you
- [00:46] see all the time new versions of
- [00:48] Postgress or MySQL coming out. And there
- [00:51] are also folks and people who actually
- [00:54] use MySQL and Postgress to build
- [00:56] applications like Instagram, LinkedIn,
- [00:58] Twitter and whatnot. Now AI is also
- [01:01] exactly like this. There are people who
- [01:03] are deep researchers of AI who helps to
- [01:06] build the models and increase the
- [01:08] performance of their model or decrease
- [01:10] the cost of the tokens. And there are
- [01:13] people who actually uses these
- [01:15] technologies like rag and LLM models and
- [01:18] build products using those tech. This
- [01:21] course is the later one. We are going to
- [01:23] take all these tech which are around
- [01:25] there and we are going to learn about
- [01:26] the applied AI. How we can use these AI
- [01:30] the LLM techs the rag technology and
- [01:32] build product around it so that
- [01:34] businesses can directly use our tech and
- [01:37] we can just implement products and use
- [01:39] AI in building those products. If this
- [01:42] sounds exciting building projects and
- [01:44] implementing directly the AI you are at
- [01:46] the right course. Hey there everyone, my
- [01:48] name is Atesh and I have been writing
- [01:49] code and teaching code for almost 15
- [01:51] years. I have built my startups. I have
- [01:54] built tremendous amount of projects and
- [01:56] products and companies around it and
- [01:59] these days I love teaching. I've been
- [02:01] teaching for over a decade and my
- [02:03] specialty is to turn the toughest topic
- [02:05] into the easiest one.
- [02:07] >> Hi, my name is Push and I'm working as a
- [02:10] AI engineer for past 3 to four years.
- [02:12] Along with that, I run a YouTube channel
- [02:14] and I have a teaching experience of six
- [02:17] years where we talk about full stack
- [02:19] development. We talk about databases, we
- [02:21] talk about how backends work, how front
- [02:23] ends work. We also talk about the AI
- [02:26] workflows and AI agents. We both love to
- [02:29] teach and that's why we teach at YouTube
- [02:31] in cohorts and on Udemy course as well.
- [02:34] Combinely, we serve around over 2
- [02:36] million users on our YouTube channels
- [02:39] and we know how it is to teach the tech.
- [02:41] In this course, we are going to build
- [02:43] some really exciting projects. What
- [02:45] about building your own cursor CLI? Or
- [02:48] maybe what about building your own
- [02:49] knowledge graph? Or maybe what about
- [02:52] building a conversational voice enabled
- [02:55] AI which talks to you, which codes for
- [02:57] you and does things for you. So these
- [03:00] all exciting projects are covered in
- [03:02] this course and trust me these are
- [03:04] really easy to build with AI agentic and
- [03:07] agentic workflows. And at the end we are
- [03:09] also going to cover MCP the model
- [03:12] context protocol which was a missing
- [03:14] piece in the AI world. So we are going
- [03:16] to see what is MCP and how this enhances
- [03:20] the model context and the tool calling
- [03:22] for these AI agents. Now this is not
- [03:24] all. This is a constantly updated course
- [03:27] just like all of our other courses and
- [03:30] yes we will be keep on adding more
- [03:31] content into this one so that you always
- [03:33] stay updated in this era of AI. I'm
- [03:37] super excited to have you inside this
- [03:39] course
- [03:39] >> and I am also super excited to see you
- [03:41] in the course
- [03:42] >> and together we're going to make your
- [03:44] journey of learning AI super easy, super
- [03:47] comfortable and of course super
- [03:49] knowledgeable.
- [03:50] >> So see you in the course.
- [03:51] >> Yes, of course. See you inside the
- [03:53] course.
