- [00:03] mCP has really exploded past few weeks
- [00:05] if you want to learn what mCP actually
- [00:08] is there are probably tall videos and
- [00:10] tweets that you can go through already
- [00:12] so I wouldn't dive too deep into that
- [00:13] but today what I really want to talk
- [00:15] about is what kind of startup
- [00:16] opportunity I saw with this mCP
- [00:19] ecosystem blooming and also a stepbystep
- [00:21] process of how can you build a mCP
- [00:24] server from scratch po play and
- [00:25] distribute to others and at extremely
- [00:28] high level mCP basically provides a
- [00:30] unified way for your AI agents or AI
- [00:32] application to access external
- [00:34] assistance as example a few weeks ago I
- [00:36] post this video about how I use all
- [00:38] sorts different mCP in my AI coding
- [00:40] workflow that made AI coding agents a
- [00:42] lot better and if you have been building
- [00:44] AI you probably wondering how is this
- [00:47] mCP different from T call which is
- [00:49] something introduced by open AI almost
- [00:51] two years ago that also allow AI agents
- [00:53] and large L models to take actions
- [00:55] external assistance where the key thing
- [00:57] here is a standard even though large L
- [00:59] model can already take actions in real
- [01:01] world through function calling but each
- [01:03] one of those large L model provider has
- [01:05] different format like open a will
- [01:07] support a two core format looks like
- [01:09] this with name arguments and become part
- [01:12] of conversation history while claw have
- [01:14] a totally different Json format same for
- [01:16] Gemini and llama so each one of those
- [01:18] large L model provider have different
- [01:20] default ways of interacting with
- [01:22] external system but mCP provide a
- [01:24] unified format of how two code should be
- [01:26] communicated if you want to draw some
- [01:28] analogy this somewhat similar to the
- [01:30] early days of Internet there's a portol
- [01:32] called tcpip where before TCP IP each
- [01:35] company has its own standard about how
- [01:37] different device should communicate each
- [01:39] other like IBM have their own protocol
- [01:41] called sna and even Apple has their own
- [01:43] thing called Apple talk they allow
- [01:45] macing touchbased Network to talk to
- [01:47] each other but if you want to build
- [01:49] something that integrate across
- [01:50] different device that means you need to
- [01:51] build custom things for every single
- [01:53] standard but with introduction of
- [01:55] standard like TCP IP everything became
- [01:58] unified which means if you're raer you
- [02:00] just need to build once with this
- [02:02] protocol standard and it allow you to
- [02:04] build for the whole internet and this
- [02:06] changed the value dramatically new
- [02:07] protocol like worldwide web https all
- [02:10] came out and enable business like ncape
- [02:13] yaho Google and internet eventually
- [02:15] became where it is now and this also
- [02:17] part of the reason why I found mCP is so
- [02:19] exciting and we should pay a lot of
- [02:21] attention to it because there will be
- [02:23] lots of opportunities and companies to
- [02:25] be built around this ecosystem for
- [02:26] example with unified protocol like mCP
- [02:29] the entry point for building new AI
- [02:31] agent clients like cursor Wing serve
- [02:33] Manu becomes lower and lower because you
- [02:35] don't need to build all the Integrations
- [02:37] yourself you can just connect to
- [02:38] existing mcps and this kind of draw the
- [02:41] analogy in my mind would be similar to
- [02:43] iPhone windows or even browser like
- [02:45] nascap that directly interact with end
- [02:47] user and those AI agent clients will be
- [02:49] the main driver of adoption for all
- [02:52] sorts different mcps for example this
- [02:53] concept mCP isn't new is introduced
- [02:56] almost 6 months ago but only exploded
- [02:58] recently because with finally have
- [03:00] killer AI agent use case like cursor and
- [03:03] Wing surve which is just one type of use
- [03:05] case like coding agents but with more
- [03:08] vertical AI agents show up like sales
- [03:10] agents customer support agents or even
- [03:12] general purpose agents there will be
- [03:15] needs and requirements for different mCP
- [03:16] servers and on the other hand there also
- [03:18] a lot of opportunity for creating a
- [03:20] Marketplace for mcps there already
- [03:22] existing website like GL and Smith where
- [03:26] they help people to discover what type
- [03:28] of mcps are out there and a lot of hard
- [03:30] work in terms of testing and curating
- [03:32] those mcps it's kind of similar to how
- [03:35] those existing ecosystem has app store
- [03:37] or early days of Yahoo has index page
- [03:40] for people to find the interesting
- [03:41] websites but the most important one is
- [03:43] mCP itself they kind of like apps in app
- [03:46] stores the any iPhone and Android users
- [03:49] can go and access to enhance their
- [03:51] experience and even though at moment mCP
- [03:53] is like a wi web where everything seems
- [03:55] open source and still quite difficult to
- [03:57] use but there are already companies like
- [03:59] 20 First Step introduce new products
- [04:01] that is the mCP the existing in clients
- [04:04] like cursor Wing surf that enhance their
- [04:06] coding experience specialized in helping
- [04:09] AI agent to get more context of how to
- [04:11] build beautiful UI and they add G
- [04:13] monetization for those mcps so I
- [04:16] actually expect a lot of new business to
- [04:18] come up that just building mCP and
- [04:20] distribute to All Sorts different users
- [04:22] and to monetize from that that's why
- [04:23] today I want to show you how can you
- [04:25] build a mCP from scratch so that you can
- [04:28] either build mCP for yourself to enhance
- [04:30] your own experience or you can
- [04:33] distribute that to others and even try
- [04:35] out building a mCP based business and
- [04:38] the good thing is that it is not hard
- [04:39] it's actually pretty simple and
- [04:41] straightforward I'll take you through
- [04:42] example of how did I build a figma mCP
- [04:45] from scratch and list down those
- [04:47] Marketplace like glama and symetry but
- [04:49] before I dive into this if you are
- [04:50] launching your own mCP or any type of
- [04:53] product building the product itself just
- [04:55] half the work after the product is built
- [04:57] the next challenge is how to get your
- [04:58] product to the market Market
- [04:59] successfully nine out of 10 business
- [05:01] venture fail and 10% don't even make the
- [05:03] first year and the key difference here
- [05:05] is often how solid your go-to Market
- [05:07] strategy is especially when launching
- [05:09] new prodot type like mCP that's why I
- [05:11] want to introduce you to this free goto
- [05:14] Market playbook for launching new
- [05:15] products then made by hosital they
- [05:17] interview top experts from successful
- [05:19] startups about their best practice
- [05:21] process on PCT launch it covers
- [05:23] step-by-step process of how can you
- [05:25] design a lunch blueprint between Market
- [05:27] product and distribution Channel then
- [05:29] where and how should you go find signals
- [05:31] of the market that your product is
- [05:33] targeting at how to craft the perfect
- [05:35] Market story and step-by-step process to
- [05:37] build your viral tweet it even including
- [05:39] ready to use metric dashboard to track
- [05:41] your new product launch with real world
- [05:43] insights from goto Market experts giving
- [05:45] Hands-On guidance I learned a lot from
- [05:47] this package and I highly recommend you
- [05:49] go and try out if you're planning to
- [05:51] launch a product I put a link in the
- [05:53] description below for you to download
- [05:55] for free now let's get back to how to
- [05:56] build your own mCP so entropic actually
- [05:59] provide specific SDK for python
- [06:01] typescript Java codling so you can use
- [06:04] the language that you are most familiar
- [06:05] with and for me I will be using python
- [06:07] SDK so if you take a look at GitHub here
- [06:10] I'll do pip install mCP so our open
- [06:12] Terminal and just do pip install mCP we
- [06:14] can create a new file called test mCP
- [06:17] dopy so they provide a class called Fast
- [06:20] mCP we can just call this fast mCP class
- [06:23] to initiate a new mCP server with this
- [06:25] one we can just do a decorator mCP do
- [06:28] tool and then Define function here and
- [06:30] when writing the function you can give a
- [06:31] description about what does the function
- [06:33] do as well as what kind of inputs does
- [06:35] it expect and the output to give large L
- [06:37] mod or more context and you can save
- [06:40] this and this mCP is already working we
- [06:42] can quickly go to your mCP settings in
- [06:45] cursor we will right click this file and
- [06:47] copy past and I will just add a new mCP
- [06:50] here I give name my mCP and command will
- [06:53] be mCP run and pasting the pass here and
- [06:56] click add and after it is running you
- [06:58] can see this my mCP has been added
- [07:01] already with the function we defined
- [07:03] here so with this turn on I can already
- [07:05] open the chat and then prompt the cursor
- [07:06] agent help me calculate my bmi where I'm
- [07:09] 70 kg with
- [07:12] 173 CM height you can see here it call
- [07:15] the calculate BMI function pass on this
- [07:18] two variables and then get result back
- [07:21] so this is how easy it is to actually
- [07:22] set up your mCP server and to practice
- [07:25] this further let's try to build a figma
- [07:27] mCP where can read your figma file and
- [07:29] also convert Your figma Design into hity
- [07:32] react page so first let's take a look at
- [07:35] the figma API so figma actually only
- [07:37] have four end points for you to get data
- [07:39] out one is get file which will return
- [07:42] everything in your specific project file
- [07:44] and get file node allow you to specify a
- [07:47] very specific node ID so in figma every
- [07:50] single UI components you see here on the
- [07:52] left side is a note and you can actually
- [07:55] copy the link to selection and if you
- [07:57] paste the link here you can see that it
- [07:59] also has node ID that point to that
- [08:01] specific frame so this endpoint will
- [08:03] allow to get a very specific component
- [08:05] or page out of figma file as well as get
- [08:08] image and get image will return the
- [08:10] image screenshot of the mup but
- [08:12] unfortunately AI coding agents like
- [08:14] cursor or Wing serve can't really take
- [08:16] image response from mCP yet but with the
- [08:18] first two endpoint we can already do a
- [08:20] lot of cool stuff so I will be using
- [08:22] this endpoint of get file notes to
- [08:24] return the details of specific frame so
- [08:26] I'll create a new EMV and go to my figma
- [08:29] click settings security and click
- [08:31] generate new token given name test and
- [08:34] generate it so you can copy this token
- [08:36] over and paste in here so I go back to
- [08:38] our test mCP file and add a few new
- [08:41] Imports and our load the DMV and load
- [08:44] the figma API token first they create a
- [08:46] helper function called Fetch figma nodes
- [08:49] where it will pass on the file key and
- [08:51] node ID and calling this endpoint which
- [08:54] is what do we see here and then we will
- [08:56] do mCP do2 create function called G Noe
- [08:59] where where we pass on file key and node
- [09:01] ID and our add some descriptions here
- [09:03] that it is to get specific node from
- [09:05] figma file and I will also pass on a bit
- [09:07] of information about what's the file key
- [09:09] and what's node ID and its format and
- [09:11] then our Define function where our Cod
- [09:13] API and point return the response so we
- [09:16] can quickly test out I'm going to copy
- [09:18] the link paste in here and extract file
- [09:21] key and node ID so I'll do python test
- [09:25] mcpi cool and you can see it return uh a
- [09:28] Blog of Json of how does that mup look
- [09:31] like great so this function is working
- [09:32] and all we need to do now just go back
- [09:34] to cursor mCP and if we refresh a little
- [09:38] bit you can see a new function called G
- [09:40] node is showing up here and just to test
- [09:42] this out I can add a new agent and I
- [09:44] will just copy the link and here I have
- [09:47] extremely basic mop so I just right
- [09:50] click copy the link to selection and go
- [09:53] back here and give Implement UI like
- [09:55] figma mop here in Pixel Perfect manner
- [09:57] in index.html you can see it called
- [09:59] again note mcp2 and it return whole
- [10:02] bunch of information about this UI that
- [10:04] we Define in figma then start creating
- [10:06] this HTML page cool so now if we open
- [10:09] this webs page you can see this is Page
- [10:11] generated it kind of get most part right
- [10:14] but some part is looks a bit off and you
- [10:17] might be wondering why and the key
- [10:18] reason here is because if you look at
- [10:21] response in return including whole bunch
- [10:23] of information that is not relevant or
- [10:26] very complicated for large L model to
- [10:28] understand like the color is rgba format
- [10:31] which you can probably communicate in a
- [10:33] lot less token so what we want to do is
- [10:35] we want to clean up the information a
- [10:37] little bit more and this is exactly what
- [10:39] I did so I have a new file called clean
- [10:41] node. py and in here I have a whole
- [10:44] bunch of helper function that can help
- [10:46] you return more clean information and I
- [10:48] actually got a lot of Inspirations from
- [10:50] another mCP server created by Graham but
- [10:52] basically do a whole bunch of clean up
- [10:54] of the information and I can load those
- [10:57] functions from clean node in transform
- [10:59] fig adjacent and come back here at a
- [11:03] clean response equal to this and return
- [11:06] clean response and go to mCP and refresh
- [11:09] again and now let me try this
- [11:11] again and now you can see the UI looks
- [11:14] exactly like the UI we present in figma
- [11:16] file so this how you can build a new mCP
- [11:19] from scratch that's running on locally
- [11:21] but you can also distribute to others
- [11:23] the next thing you want to do is
- [11:24] probably distribute your awesome mCP
- [11:26] server to others and there platforms
- [11:27] like GL or Myster they're providing
- [11:30] existing repository of mcps for you to
- [11:33] distribute to others so all you need to
- [11:35] do just write down a doc with all
- [11:37] dependencies and read me so other people
- [11:39] know how to run this and cursor is
- [11:41] actually pretty good at it so you can
- [11:42] just give a prompt I have this mCP
- [11:44] server implemented help me write the
- [11:46] required. dxt and read me and once it's
- [11:48] done you can upload this project to
- [11:50] GitHub and then go back to like GL click
- [11:52] on ADD server given name description as
- [11:55] well as your GitHub Ripple once you add
- [11:57] that it will go through a process of
- [11:59] reviewing and if everything passed then
- [12:01] other people will be able to search and
- [12:04] install the server directly and I have
- [12:06] already put my figma mCP on glama and
- [12:08] Smith Tre where you can just go and
- [12:09] download and for the figma mCP I will
- [12:12] continue to improve that I already added
- [12:13] new functionalities like get components
- [12:16] so that it can extract all the reusable
- [12:17] components in your figma file as well as
- [12:20] workflow so it can get the figma protype
- [12:22] workflow to better understand the use
- [12:24] flow if you have any feedback or
- [12:25] question about mCP feel free to DM me on
- [12:28] Twitter or you can join my AI Builder
- [12:30] Club Community where I will continue
- [12:32] sharing interesting mCP and AI coding
- [12:34] workflows that I'm experimenting with
- [12:36] detailed breakdown of some my favorite
- [12:38] mCP that I use day-to-day as well as
- [12:40] more in depth course and tutorial about
- [12:42] AI coding and building production agents
- [12:45] but most importantly we have this
- [12:46] community of top AI Builders who might
- [12:48] already experience a problem that you
- [12:50] are facing right now as a solopreneur so
- [12:52] you can come and ask any question you
- [12:54] have to get support I have put the link
- [12:56] to join the community in the description
- [12:58] below I hope you enjoyed this video
- [13:00] please comment about what type of mcps
- [13:02] that you are building or you really want
- [13:04] others to build thank you and I'll see
- [13:05] you next time
