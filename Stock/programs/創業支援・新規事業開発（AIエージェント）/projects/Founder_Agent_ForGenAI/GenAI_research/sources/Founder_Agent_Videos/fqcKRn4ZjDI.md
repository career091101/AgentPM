- [00:00] Imagine being able to build and deploy a
- [00:03] complete AI agent in just minutes. No
- [00:05] server setup, no complicated frameworks,
- [00:08] and no endless documentation. That's
- [00:10] exactly what Toolhouse delivers.
- [00:12] Toolhouse is a back-end as a service
- [00:15] that's built specifically for AI
- [00:16] developers. Whether you're creating an
- [00:19] assistant to handle daily tasks, a code
- [00:21] review bot, or a fully custom automation
- [00:24] agent, Toolhouse takes care of the
- [00:26] complex backend so that you can focus
- [00:29] entirely on building. It's fast,
- [00:31] developer friendly, and designed for
- [00:33] those who like to vibe code, create
- [00:35] great things quickly without friction.
- [00:38] Just take a look at this demo to see how
- [00:40] powerful Toolhouse really is. I started
- [00:42] building a simple AI agent that acts
- [00:44] like a regular person. Its only job was
- [00:47] to send me an email requesting to meet
- [00:49] just like a normal user would. But
- [00:51] behind the scenes, the email was
- [00:53] generated and sent by an AI agent that I
- [00:55] built using Toolhouse, all within a
- [00:58] couple of minutes. Next, I built a
- [01:00] second agent, which is aulular agent.
- [01:02] This one automatically scans my inbox
- [01:04] for meeting requests as well as creates
- [01:07] calendar invites and even pings me on
- [01:09] Discord to keep me updated. To make it
- [01:12] all work, I simply pasted the URL of a
- [01:14] remote MCP server. In this case, one was
- [01:17] hosted through Zapier, which connected
- [01:20] the agent to the Google calendar, Gmail,
- [01:22] as well as Discord with no complex setup
- [01:24] and no manual integration. I then
- [01:27] deployed all the agents with a single
- [01:29] click, and Toolhouse instantly spun up a
- [01:31] hosted UI so I can start chatting with
- [01:34] it right away. And as soon as I did
- [01:36] this, theuler agent activated. It read
- [01:39] the email from the first agent, created
- [01:41] a calendar event based on the meeting
- [01:43] request, and then it sent me a
- [01:45] notification through Discord. All of
- [01:47] this happened automatically, and it was
- [01:49] powered by Toolhouse and MCP. And I
- [01:52] didn't write a single line of backend
- [01:53] code, which is the amazing part. Well,
- [01:56] you may wonder what's the point of using
- [01:58] Toolhouse. Well, the reason is because
- [02:00] building with most AI projects is where
- [02:02] you often deal with different APIs,
- [02:05] databases, and vector stores. But with
- [02:07] Toolhouse, it makes it super effortless.
- [02:10] It provides a complete backend for AI
- [02:13] applications right out the box. And it's
- [02:15] going to let you build AI agents rapidly
- [02:17] with any large language model. And you
- [02:19] can connect to it various sorts of tools
- [02:21] to automate and build anything. This is
- [02:24] where you can connect it with tools like
- [02:25] notion, Gmail or Slack through MCP and
- [02:28] add rag for document ingestion in
- [02:31] seconds. Everything runs smoothly from
- [02:33] one unified platform where there's no
- [02:35] complex setup, no extra configuration.
- [02:38] Just open Toolhouse and you can build
- [02:39] your agent in natural language and you
- [02:41] can deploy it in less than a couple
- [02:43] minutes. To get started, it is super
- [02:45] simple. Use the link in the description
- [02:46] below to head over to Toolhouse. And
- [02:48] once you are here, click on start
- [02:50] building. This will prompt you to either
- [02:52] sign in with an account or you can
- [02:54] create one completely for free. After
- [02:56] creating account or signing in, you're
- [02:57] going to be then greeted with the main
- [02:59] dashboard of Toolhouse. Now, you have
- [03:01] two ways to get started. You can either
- [03:03] use the agent studio where you can
- [03:05] simply type in a prompt in plain natural
- [03:07] language to build out your agent or you
- [03:10] can use the CLI to build it out as well.
- [03:12] You have two different ways to do this
- [03:14] and I'll showcase the CLI method later
- [03:16] on in the video. But this is essentially
- [03:18] where you can describe anything you want
- [03:20] your AI agent to do and it'll be fully
- [03:23] built out. Now there's also a couple of
- [03:25] different pre-built options that you can
- [03:27] work with different agents in different
- [03:29] domains that haven't already configured
- [03:31] and you can discover all of these
- [03:33] different agents amongst these
- [03:35] categories so that you can easily get
- [03:37] started with the template. Now within
- [03:39] the left hand side you have the agent
- [03:40] studio where you can manage all of your
- [03:43] agents that you have created. You have
- [03:45] agent runs where you can track
- [03:47] individual records of what happened with
- [03:50] each run and you can see all the results
- [03:52] and logs of generations. Bundles are
- [03:55] essentially where you can group a bunch
- [03:57] of different MCPs that your agent can
- [04:00] use. If you click on create bundle, you
- [04:02] can have it so that you can enable all
- [04:04] of these external tools that your AI
- [04:06] agent can access from Tavly web search
- [04:09] to something like sending an email. It
- [04:12] has the ability to access all these
- [04:14] external tools that can basically
- [04:16] enhance your agents capability. You can
- [04:19] even schedule different agent runs. You
- [04:22] can even use different external MCP
- [04:24] servers. So if you want to add in an
- [04:27] MCP, you can request that as well. But
- [04:29] there is a lot of different servers that
- [04:31] you can use and power your AI agent
- [04:33] with. And to showcase how simple it is,
- [04:35] for example, say if I want to use this
- [04:37] template for seed stage startup finder
- [04:39] where it builds an agent to find
- [04:41] seedstage SAS startups on Crunchbace and
- [04:44] Angelus. We can click on use now and it
- [04:47] will then send in the prompt to the
- [04:48] agent studio to work on building it out
- [04:51] where it can configure the agent title
- [04:53] system prompt as well as the user
- [04:55] message. And you can see right away it
- [04:56] has already developed the agent for us.
- [04:59] This is where we requested it to build
- [05:00] an agent to find the startups off of
- [05:03] those two websites. And now with the
- [05:05] agent UI, you can send in any prompts to
- [05:07] interact with that agent. So we can ask
- [05:09] it to please find a list of seedstage s
- [05:12] startups from Crunchbase and Angelus.
- [05:14] And it's going to be able to use its
- [05:16] tools that are built within the agent
- [05:19] like web searching as well as crawling.
- [05:21] And you can see that it's going to be
- [05:22] able to extract a list of different
- [05:24] startups that are found off of
- [05:26] CrunchBase as well as Angel List. And
- [05:28] after a couple seconds, you can see that
- [05:30] it was able to create a comprehensive
- [05:33] list of new seedstage SAS startups off
- [05:36] of CrunchBase as well as Angelist. Not
- [05:39] only the website, the description, the
- [05:41] location, as well as the funding stage.
- [05:43] Just off of this single prompt, a
- [05:45] textual prompt, it was able to build out
- [05:47] this agent that has web searching
- [05:49] capabilities, scraping capabilities, and
- [05:51] so much more. This is the capability of
- [05:53] toolhouse and how you can easily build
- [05:55] different production ready agents. And
- [05:58] you can access the code and once you're
- [06:00] ready, you can even publish it. So if
- [06:02] needed, you can access and share this
- [06:04] link around so others can access this
- [06:06] agent. And now that you have basically
- [06:09] created the backend functionality of
- [06:11] your app, you can then have it connected
- [06:13] to a front-end builder like lovable or
- [06:15] both. And you can basically vibe code it
- [06:17] further where you can have it create the
- [06:20] front end with these two tools and then
- [06:22] have it connected with this agent which
- [06:24] I'll showcase in a second. You can also
- [06:26] have it so that you can access it via
- [06:29] API and then you can even schedule it
- [06:31] for autoscheduled weekly execution. In
- [06:33] this case, if you already have a lovable
- [06:35] account, you can head over to it and you
- [06:37] can copy this to your clipboard, this
- [06:39] message over here, and then you can send
- [06:41] it into lovable so that it can then work
- [06:43] on building out the front-end component
- [06:46] of your agent. Toolhouse already
- [06:48] provides that front-end chatbot. But say
- [06:50] if you want to build it within an app,
- [06:52] that is where you can use lovable. This
- [06:55] is where it'll create the interface. It
- [06:57] will have it so that it's a standalone
- [06:58] app where others can access its
- [07:01] interactive accessibility and it is
- [07:04] something that's going to be production
- [07:05] ready all without writing a single line
- [07:07] of code. You can see that it is creating
- [07:10] the plan for this. And there we go. We
- [07:12] have our lovable app fully developed.
- [07:14] And this is where we can converse with
- [07:16] the agent that was developed with
- [07:18] toolhouse. And you can see that I sent
- [07:20] in the exact same prompt that I did
- [07:22] within Toolhouse. And it's going to
- [07:23] execute it by using the agent's
- [07:26] capabilities.
- [07:28] And just like that, we have the same
- [07:30] functionality of our agent working
- [07:32] within this front end that lovable
- [07:33] build. But guys, say if you want to use
- [07:35] it within the CLI, well, it's super
- [07:37] simple. You can use npm install command
- [07:40] and you can open up your command prompt.
- [07:41] You can paste this in and it's going to
- [07:43] install toolhouse CLI onto your
- [07:46] computer. And to create a new agent, you
- [07:49] can use the th new command. And this is
- [07:51] where you can simply go ahead and build
- [07:53] out a custom agent directly within your
- [07:55] CLI. This is where I have given it the
- [07:58] name as stock market agent. And this is
- [08:01] where you can now go ahead and deploy
- [08:03] the agent. And that is by using the th
- [08:06] deploy command. Then we can go ahead and
- [08:08] authenticate this by logging in with our
- [08:10] tools account.
- [08:13] And then what you can do is use the th
- [08:15] vibe and then whatever agent you have
- [08:17] created. And you can now have it so that
- [08:20] you can instantly generate a deployed
- [08:22] frontend either with lovable, bold or v
- [08:25] 0ero. This is where you can use whatever
- [08:27] option you want. But this is an option
- [08:30] where you can use the CLI to guide you
- [08:32] through selecting your preferred vibe
- [08:33] coding service and you can generate the
- [08:35] required prompt and redirect you to a
- [08:37] live AJ interface. And if you want to
- [08:40] configure the prompt before you deploy
- [08:42] it, you can definitely go into the YAM
- [08:44] file and you can configure the system
- [08:45] prompt here within your IDE or any sort
- [08:48] of editor. And yep, you can do exactly
- [08:50] the same thing off of tool houses method
- [08:53] within the agent studio. And if you want
- [08:55] to change the code like the system
- [08:57] prompt, you can add additional
- [08:59] information directly within this editor
- [09:02] that's built within the agent studio.
- [09:04] But let's say you want to enhance your
- [09:06] agent even further. Well, you can do so
- [09:08] with MCPS. This is where you can empower
- [09:11] it with external tools and data
- [09:13] processing capabilities with different
- [09:15] tool sets like XA web search which
- [09:17] allows your large English model to
- [09:18] search the internet, send emails, and so
- [09:21] many other types of capabilities. In
- [09:23] this case, we're scraping contents, but
- [09:26] you wanted to do a better job in terms
- [09:28] of scraping. We know a tool that can do
- [09:30] that, which is Firecrawl. I can use
- [09:32] whatever MCP server like Firecrawl MCP
- [09:36] to scrape better contents off of
- [09:38] websites. I can configure it by
- [09:40] providing my API key. And what's nice is
- [09:42] that you can even bundle multiple MCP
- [09:45] servers that your agent can use. This is
- [09:47] where you can enable a list of them that
- [09:49] your agent can use. And all you got to
- [09:51] do is just configure it within the agent
- [09:54] studio the prompt itself so that it runs
- [09:57] that bundle particularly. you will be
- [09:59] able to access the MCP server directly
- [10:02] with this button where you can manage
- [10:04] the API key directly from here. Now what
- [10:06] I can do is within the code I can tell
- [10:08] it to use the fire crawl MCP and I've
- [10:11] just rewrote the prompt so that it uses
- [10:13] the firecraw mcp I can click save and
- [10:16] once that is done what we can do is then
- [10:19] now go over to preview and then send in
- [10:21] any sort of request that will use the
- [10:24] firecrawl mcp based off of the
- [10:26] configurations we had provided. So,
- [10:28] let's just rerun this prompt and it will
- [10:30] now use the firecrawl mcp to scrape the
- [10:34] different contents off of angel list as
- [10:36] well as crunchbase. We can see there is
- [10:39] a list of newer companies compared to
- [10:42] what I saw previously and it was able to
- [10:45] find a lot more and US-based as well as
- [10:48] companies that are seed staged funding.
- [10:51] Overall, you can see that it did a
- [10:53] decent job in doing this and a lot
- [10:55] better than the previous scraper. If you
- [10:57] like this video and would love to
