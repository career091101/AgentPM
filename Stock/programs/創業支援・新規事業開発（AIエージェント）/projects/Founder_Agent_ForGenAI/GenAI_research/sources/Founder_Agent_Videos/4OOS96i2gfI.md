- [00:00] So, I've built hundreds of AI agents and
- [00:01] AI workflows, which means I've made
- [00:03] hundreds of mistakes building my AI
- [00:05] agents and my AI workflows. So, in this
- [00:07] video, I'm going to be talking about the
- [00:08] four different layers of the AI systems
- [00:10] pyramid. And for each layer, I'll talk
- [00:12] about when you would actually use it and
- [00:13] a real example that I either use or have
- [00:16] built in the past. I also teach and
- [00:18] coach thousands of people who are
- [00:19] building AI systems for businesses. So,
- [00:21] this isn't just a gut feeling. This is
- [00:23] actually what I'm seeing in the space as
- [00:25] one of the most common issues. So, I
- [00:27] don't want to waste any time. Let's get
- [00:28] straight into the video. So here is the
- [00:30] pyramid that I was referring to where
- [00:31] you can see we have four different
- [00:32] layers. We have custom GPTs or cloud
- [00:34] projects or things similar to those at
- [00:37] the bottom as the foundation and we move
- [00:39] all the way up to the top with our AI
- [00:40] agents. And as we move up the pyramid we
- [00:43] increase in complexity, cost and
- [00:45] maintenance. So we've got the custom
- [00:47] GPTs, we've got simple workflow
- [00:49] automation with no AI, we have AI
- [00:51] workflows and then we have AI agents up
- [00:53] top. And really the most important thing
- [00:55] to understand is that all of these are
- [00:57] great and they have their use cases, but
- [00:59] it just kind of comes back to this idea
- [01:00] of becoming a problem solver, not an AI
- [01:03] agent builder. And this is something
- [01:04] that I talk about a lot in my plus
- [01:06] community. If you want to check it out,
- [01:08] the link for that is down in the
- [01:09] description. A lot of times people will
- [01:10] come to you and they think they need AI
- [01:13] or they know they need to start using
- [01:14] AI, but they don't know exactly how. And
- [01:16] they'll tell you what's going on. But
- [01:18] your job isn't to say, "Here's what I
- [01:20] will do with AI." Your job is to say,
- [01:21] okay, let's actually understand the root
- [01:23] of this problem and what is the most
- [01:25] efficient solution that we can implement
- [01:27] right away that will give you quick win
- [01:29] that will, you know, keep your cost low
- [01:31] and keep everything simple. And a lot of
- [01:33] times the answer could just be a simple
- [01:35] automation or a cloud project or maybe a
- [01:38] SAS product that already exists out
- [01:40] there. All right, so let's go ahead and
- [01:41] start with this bottom layer. What
- [01:43] actually is this bottom layer? Well, a
- [01:46] custom GPT or project or gym is a
- [01:49] conversational AI assistant that you're
- [01:51] able to preconfigure with your own
- [01:53] specific instructions, knowledge base,
- [01:54] and voice. So, you can almost think of
- [01:56] it as an intern who knows your company
- [01:59] because you give it a prompt, you give
- [02:01] it data, and then you ask it to help you
- [02:03] out with things. And the defining
- [02:04] characteristic here is that it's
- [02:06] entirely reactive, meaning it doesn't
- [02:08] scale a ton because it only actually
- [02:10] works when you trigger it or when you
- [02:12] initiate a conversation with it. And so
- [02:14] there's a lot of use cases where people
- [02:16] are telling me about how they do
- [02:17] something manually and typically they
- [02:18] will be triggered by a certain event and
- [02:20] they will need to do something and they
- [02:22] might need some sort of like back and
- [02:23] forth loop or the ability to iterate. So
- [02:26] for example with me every time I make an
- [02:27] end YouTube tutorial if you guys have
- [02:29] seen those in the past and I drop my
- [02:31] templates in the community I typically
- [02:32] have a sticky note in there that's like
- [02:34] a setup guide. And this is a super
- [02:36] repetitive process because it happens
- [02:37] every time I post a YouTube video. So I
- [02:39] needed to make some sort of system to
- [02:41] help me do this quicker. But if I built
- [02:43] an automation for it, it could
- [02:44] effectively do the same thing, but I
- [02:46] would still end up doing a lot of
- [02:47] revision and it might be more manual
- [02:49] than if I just set up a custom GPT and I
- [02:52] gave it instructions about how to do the
- [02:54] setup guide and different links that I
- [02:55] like to use and things like that. And
- [02:56] then if I need revisions, I'm already in
- [02:58] that interface and I can just tweak it
- [03:00] until I get something. And now that
- [03:02] process for me is super quick and easy.
- [03:04] All right, moving on to the second
- [03:05] layer. This is simple workflow
- [03:07] automation. So this is when you have a
- [03:09] series of steps connected together that
- [03:11] run automatically on some sort of
- [03:13] trigger that follow pure if then
- [03:15] conditional logic with zero AI
- [03:18] intelligence. The defining
- [03:19] characteristic here is that it's
- [03:20] completely predictable. It's got the
- [03:22] same trigger. It's got the same sequence
- [03:23] and you have basically the same output.
- [03:25] So it's a very deterministic flow with a
- [03:27] predictable input and predictable
- [03:29] sequence of steps and then predictable
- [03:31] output. Now that doesn't mean we can't
- [03:33] have something intelligent in here like
- [03:35] polling. But once again, that polling
- [03:36] check right here is based on did it
- [03:38] either succeed or error. And that's
- [03:41] black and white. There's no element of
- [03:42] reasoning in there. And these are a step
- [03:44] up from a custom GBT because these can
- [03:47] run in the background while you sleep.
- [03:49] It could be triggered when a meeting
- [03:50] recording has been finished or it could
- [03:52] be triggered every morning at 6 a.m.
- [03:54] Things like that. Now, just one more
- [03:56] step up from that is an AI workflow,
- [03:58] which basically holds the same principle
- [04:00] of a set amount of steps or a set
- [04:03] sequence of steps in the same order
- [04:05] every single time. But now we're able to
- [04:07] use AI in there for a little bit of
- [04:09] reasoning or output. So even though
- [04:12] there's AI to do some planning and to do
- [04:14] some writing and editing, it still
- [04:16] happens in the same order where it goes
- [04:17] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Now, another use
- [04:22] case of adding AI into a workflow is
- [04:23] maybe you need AI to understand which
- [04:26] way to switch. So, like in this example,
- [04:28] and here's another quick little setup
- [04:29] guide. You can see that the AI right
- [04:32] here classifies the incoming email and
- [04:34] decides if it is going to be support or
- [04:36] finance or priority or promotion. And
- [04:39] that is because it would be really hard
- [04:40] for traditional logic or code to be able
- [04:43] to read the body of an email and the
- [04:44] subject and then push it down one of
- [04:47] these paths. It would really only be
- [04:49] able to do that if it was looking for a
- [04:50] specific keyword to trigger it. But in
- [04:52] this case, we actually need AI to read
- [04:54] and understand and then shoot it off in
- [04:56] the right direction. But this is still a
- [04:58] workflow because there's no full
- [05:00] autonomy and decision-m. It's basically
- [05:02] just one very narrow use case of AI and
- [05:05] then we go right back into our
- [05:06] traditional sequence of steps. So the
- [05:08] defining characteristic here is fixed
- [05:10] path with intelligent decisions. The
- [05:12] workflow always follows the same
- [05:13] structure, but AI makes contextawware
- [05:15] choices within that structure. And
- [05:17] actually, what I've seen when we've
- [05:19] worked with businesses and when we've
- [05:20] helped people work with businesses is
- [05:22] that the majority of automations can be
- [05:24] simple and they don't even need any AI.
- [05:27] And I'm talking like 50% of automations
- [05:29] that you could go in and build for a
- [05:31] business right away. But then you start
- [05:34] to get a little bit more complex or
- [05:35] maybe on your traditional automations,
- [05:37] you want to make them a little bit more,
- [05:39] you know, increase the functionality.
- [05:40] And that's where you may just need to
- [05:41] add a little AI step at the end or in
- [05:44] the beginning or something like that.
- [05:45] But when you're just getting started
- [05:46] with a business and you're helping them
- [05:48] get more automation ready, the AI agent
- [05:51] is almost never the right call to start
- [05:53] off with right away. And even just
- [05:55] helping teams integrate custom GPTs and
- [05:57] Gemini gems and things like that into
- [05:58] their daily workflow will also drive a
- [06:00] ton of efficiency. So finally, let's
- [06:02] take a look at an AI agent example. So
- [06:05] what this actually is is an autonomous
- [06:07] system that can work toward a goal by
- [06:09] perceiving its environment, making
- [06:10] decisions, calling tools, handling
- [06:12] exceptions, and adapting its approach
- [06:14] because it is basically fully autonomous
- [06:16] here. So as you can see with the
- [06:18] defining characteristic, true agency and
- [06:20] autonomy. You give it a goal and it
- [06:22] figures out I have these five tools,
- [06:24] which ones do I use and in what order do
- [06:26] I use them to achieve said goal? So in
- [06:29] this case, this was a marketing team
- [06:30] that I did for a YouTube video. And you
- [06:32] can see that it got a request from a
- [06:34] human via Telegram and it used its brain
- [06:36] to understand, okay, I have these three
- [06:38] content creation tools. I have these two
- [06:40] image creation tools and I have this
- [06:42] database tool. Which ones do I need to
- [06:44] use? And it had full autonomy based on
- [06:46] its system prompt and input to help it
- [06:48] work towards its end goal. But it's
- [06:50] actually interesting if you were paying
- [06:51] attention. this create image tool or
- [06:53] maybe it was the edit image tool is
- [06:55] actually this one right here where we
- [06:57] hooked it up to call on this tool. And
- [06:59] the reason why I'm saying that it's
- [07:00] interesting is because even though we
- [07:02] give the agent autonomy to call on its
- [07:04] tools once it chose the right path we
- [07:06] basically wanted it to stay super
- [07:09] predictable and that helped with the
- [07:10] agents performance a lot more because
- [07:12] its tools are workflows or AI workflows.
- [07:15] the way that I architected that to have
- [07:17] all of these be fixed. This almost makes
- [07:19] it seem a little bit more like an AI
- [07:21] workflow here where the AI does the
- [07:23] reasoning and then shoots it down a
- [07:24] fixed path. But the only difference is
- [07:26] after it would go down this path, it's
- [07:28] done. But in this example, it could go
- [07:30] back and forth as many times as it
- [07:31] wanted. So I know it can be a little
- [07:32] overwhelming. So I made this really
- [07:34] simple diagram to help you understand
- [07:37] what should you actually be looking to
- [07:38] build based on your problem at hand. So
- [07:40] the first question would be, do I need
- [07:42] to be in the loop every time? If yes,
- [07:45] custom GPT is the answer. If no, move on
- [07:48] to question two, which is, are the steps
- [07:50] 100% logic- based? Meaning, could I have
- [07:53] a simple filter or a simple code? Or is
- [07:55] there a very explicit black and white
- [07:57] thing that tells me which way to go? If
- [07:59] yes, build a workflow? If no, then come
- [08:02] down here to question three, which is,
- [08:03] is the order of operations fixed? Is it
- [08:05] predictable? If yes, you're going to go
- [08:07] with an AI workflow. If no, if you need
- [08:09] some more autonomy and decision-m and
- [08:11] flexibility, then you want to go with an
- [08:13] AI agent. Now, I wanted to end off with
- [08:15] one example of maybe even a time where
- [08:17] you would come down to question three
- [08:19] and your answer would be yes, but you
- [08:21] still might want an AI agent instead.
- [08:23] And so, here's a really simple example
- [08:25] where we have a customer support agent
- [08:27] or customer support flow. And what
- [08:28] happens is it receives an email and it
- [08:30] has to use its brain to understand,
- [08:32] okay, here's the email I have. I have a
- [08:34] database I can look through and then I
- [08:36] need to reply to the incoming email with
- [08:38] accurate information. And so when I
- [08:40] think about that process as far as like
- [08:42] how would I do that manually, I would
- [08:44] one read the email, I would two check
- [08:46] the knowledge base and then I would
- [08:48] three write a response. And it really
- [08:50] should happen in that sequence every
- [08:51] single time. Which is why this could
- [08:53] also be a workflow where we read the
- [08:55] email, we search the knowledge base. We
- [08:56] even do something fancy here where we
- [08:58] filter to keep just the best responses.
- [09:00] But anyways, then we write the email and
- [09:02] then we respond to it. But the
- [09:04] difference here is sometimes you may not
- [09:05] need to search the knowledge base. In
- [09:06] that case, you would just be wasting
- [09:08] time and tokens where you could just
- [09:09] reply right away. Or sometimes you need
- [09:11] to search the knowledge base three or
- [09:13] four or five times before you're
- [09:15] confident. And in that case, the agent
- [09:16] up here would be better as well. The
- [09:18] point I'm trying to make is that it's
- [09:19] never just a clear black and white logic
- [09:22] flowchart like this. It depends on the
- [09:25] situation and it depends on how you
- [09:27] would want the manual process to be
- [09:29] done. And then the other tough pill to
- [09:31] swallow at times is just the fact that
- [09:33] you don't know what you don't know.
- [09:34] Sometimes all the signs might be
- [09:36] pointing to using a custom GPT, but then
- [09:38] you might have to just scale up after a
- [09:40] few months of usage to an AI workflow.
- [09:42] Or you might have an AI agent and then
- [09:43] realize later you have to scale that
- [09:44] down after you've actually had time to
- [09:47] let it get some runs and let it collect
- [09:48] some feedback. But once again, if you
- [09:50] have that problem solving mindset, it
- [09:52] shouldn't be an issue. And if you love
- [09:54] to think about solving problems and
- [09:56] wanting to understand what is the best
- [09:58] ways to solve these problems, then like
- [10:00] I said, I talk about this kind of stuff
- [10:01] a lot in my plus community, the link for
- [10:03] that is down in the description. We've
- [10:04] got a great community of over 3,000
- [10:06] members who are building businesses and
- [10:08] automations with Naden every single day.
- [10:10] And we have a classroom section where we
- [10:12] break down lots of other stuff. Agent
- [10:14] zero 10 hours to 10 seconds, one person
- [10:16] agency course. We've got a lot of
- [10:17] projects in here which are like live NAM
- [10:20] builds and things like that. Um, and we
- [10:22] also do a live call per week. So, I
- [10:23] would love to see you guys in those
- [10:25] calls in the community. But that's going
- [10:26] to do it for today. So, if you enjoyed
- [10:28] the video or you learned something new,
- [10:29] then please give it a like. It
- [10:30] definitely helps me out a ton. And as
- [10:32] always, I appreciate you guys making it
- [10:33] to the end of the video. I'll see you on
- [10:35] the next one. Thanks, everyone.
