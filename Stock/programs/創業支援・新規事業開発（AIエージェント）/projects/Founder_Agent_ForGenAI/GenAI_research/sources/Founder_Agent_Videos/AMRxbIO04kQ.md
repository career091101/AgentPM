- [00:21] Hi, Aloha. Can you use my location and
- [00:24] sort the objects into the correct
- [00:26] compost, recycling, and trash bins? To
- [00:29] perform the sorting task based on San
- [00:31] Francisco waste guidelines, I will use
- [00:33] the green bin for compost, the blue bin
- [00:35] for recycling, and the black bin for
- [00:37] trash.
- [00:40] Here we have an agentic layers. Both
- [00:42] control the robot and have access to the
- [00:43] internet. To sort the trash, they had to
- [00:45] look up the rules and look at the
- [00:47] objects on the table, think about where
- [00:49] each object should go, matching the
- [00:50] rules that it had looked up.
- [00:54] >> The task is complete.
- [00:56] >> Good job. Thanks.
- [00:58] Hi, Apollo.
- [01:00] >> Hello there. How can I help you today?
- [01:02] >> I'm traveling to London with my friend
- [01:04] next week. Can you help me pack and put
- [01:06] the beanie in my bag?
- [01:08] >> I can certainly help you pack. I will
- [01:10] put the beanie in your bag.
- [01:12] >> And can you tell me if it's going to
- [01:13] rain while I'm there?
- [01:16] >> It will likely rain on several days next
- [01:17] week in London, particularly on
- [01:19] Wednesday, Friday night, Saturday, and
- [01:21] Sunday. I will put the umbrella into
- [01:23] your bag.
- [01:25] [Music]
- [01:32] Thanks, Apollo.
- [01:34] You're welcome.
