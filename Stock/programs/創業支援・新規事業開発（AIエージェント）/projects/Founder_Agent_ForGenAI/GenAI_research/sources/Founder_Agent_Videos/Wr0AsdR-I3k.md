- [00:00] There are many agentic AI frameworks out
- [00:02] there and we are going to talk about
- [00:04] some of the no code and with code
- [00:06] frameworks. In with code frameworks
- [00:08] we'll discuss agno, langraph, crewi etc.
- [00:11] In no code will quickly review nit and
- [00:14] make. Let's talk about eggno. It's very
- [00:16] lightweight and super fast framework to
- [00:19] build agentic application. If you want
- [00:21] to build an agent that performs really
- [00:23] fast and also you want to save on your
- [00:26] development time then agno should be
- [00:27] your choice. You can see that creating
- [00:29] agent is is as easy as writing this one
- [00:32] line where you specify model then tools
- [00:35] then instructions and when you run this
- [00:37] code it will write a report on Nvidia.
- [00:40] So see I run this code and it will write
- [00:43] a comprehensive report on Nvidia. Eggno
- [00:48] comes up with lot of tools. So uh if you
- [00:50] look at their tools you will see they
- [00:55] have so many different tools integrated
- [00:57] say Discord, email, Gmail like Slack
- [01:00] whatever and then they also have this
- [01:02] MCP integration. So if you want to use
- [01:05] some of the existing MCP servers, you
- [01:08] can just import MCP tools and you can
- [01:11] use that MCP tool as a tools argument in
- [01:14] your agent class. And that way you can
- [01:17] uh utilize all the MCP servers which are
- [01:20] out there uh on the internet. They also
- [01:22] provide knowledge, memory, reasoning or
- [01:25] whatever support you need to build a
- [01:27] reliable agent. On their GitHub, you can
- [01:29] check some of their performance
- [01:30] statistics. they have compared it with
- [01:32] langraph and you will see based on this
- [01:35] statistics agno is super fast. The
- [01:38] second one is langraph which is a
- [01:40] reliable multi-step custom workflow
- [01:43] framework. So if you want to build
- [01:45] something really custom
- [01:47] multi-step
- [01:48] workflow which is very reliable then
- [01:50] langraph should be your choice. Langraph
- [01:53] is part of langchain ecosystem.
- [01:55] Langchain is one of the most popular
- [01:57] library out there when you talk about
- [02:00] building LLM application. So Langraph
- [02:03] obviously is very popular. It is being
- [02:05] used by many companies. Uh Langchain and
- [02:08] Langraph have one issue which is they
- [02:10] release a new version and it will be
- [02:11] sometimes backward incompatible. So I
- [02:14] know some of my friends who are working
- [02:16] with this and they were getting
- [02:17] extremely frustrated with this backward
- [02:19] incompatible change. But now they have
- [02:21] improved you know they are also becoming
- [02:23] mature and this is the framework that
- [02:25] you must know if you are building agent
- [02:28] AI applications. Here I want to also
- [02:30] show you the code for lang graph where
- [02:33] you can build this kind of stateful
- [02:36] graph. Okay this is a simple graph but
- [02:38] you can have a complex graph and you can
- [02:40] orchestrate your work via this graph.
- [02:43] There can be retry, there can be
- [02:45] feedback loop. Okay. So this can build a
- [02:48] reliable agent with multi-turn approach
- [02:51] for you. Then comes crew AI. This is
- [02:54] useful especially when you are building
- [02:56] multi- aent systems with orchestration.
- [02:59] So here I have a sample code where I
- [03:02] have created a crew. So crew means
- [03:05] multiple agent right. So here in the
- [03:07] crew class you will specify both of your
- [03:09] agent. You will also specify task which
- [03:12] it will execute in sequence. Okay. And
- [03:15] if you look at agent there is a research
- [03:16] agent and there is a writer agent. Okay.
- [03:19] And also you have tools here. See here
- [03:22] you have ser dev tool. So now you
- [03:24] specify all these agents as a crew.
- [03:27] Okay. So crew is mainly for building
- [03:29] multi- aent system where you specify
- [03:32] crew which is individual agents and they
- [03:34] will work together to perform set of
- [03:37] task. Then comes Google ADK and open
- [03:39] AIDK. Google ADK provides tight GCP uh
- [03:44] integration. I have a friend who is a
- [03:46] head of chatbot division in a company
- [03:48] here in US that uses Google mainly.
- [03:51] Okay, they use Vortex, they use Google
- [03:54] cloud. So for companies which are deep
- [03:56] into Google ecosystem, it makes sense
- [03:58] that you use Google ADK. But one
- [04:01] downside of Google and even OpenAI ADK
- [04:04] is that these ADKs are designed
- [04:06] specifically for their LLM. So open AI
- [04:09] ADK will have a very good integration
- [04:11] with OpenAI models. But let's say using
- [04:13] open AI ADK if you want to integrate
- [04:15] with Google model or let's say claude
- [04:17] model I mean they will provide support
- [04:19] but I don't think it is in their best
- [04:21] interest to provide integration with
- [04:23] some third party LLMs right so because
- [04:25] of this vendor lockins what I personally
- [04:28] like is some kind of opensource model
- [04:31] agnostic framework like langraph or agno
- [04:34] you know they are not tied to a specific
- [04:36] vendor whereas these uh frameworks are
- [04:39] designed by specific companies and they
- [04:41] have this interest that okay you know
- [04:44] clients should be using their own LLMs
- [04:46] okay so if let's say you are using open
- [04:49] AI already like in your organization you
- [04:52] have been using open AI you're deep into
- [04:54] open AI ecosystem then of course you can
- [04:56] go ahead and use it otherwise I would
- [04:58] personally prefer using kui langraph
- [05:01] agno etc so this is a table which will
- [05:04] provide you a quick summary so langraph
- [05:06] is a reliable multi-step workflow
- [05:09] framework it is uh having these key
- [05:13] features state machine graph memory
- [05:14] retries and the learning curve is
- [05:16] medium. Now if you look at the most
- [05:18] easiest learning curve that is Agno.
- [05:20] Okay. So if you want to build uh super
- [05:23] fast quick agents go with Agno. If you
- [05:26] want to build multi-step workflows with
- [05:28] state machines you know state graphs go
- [05:30] with lang graph. For multi- aent system
- [05:33] go with crewi. And if you are deeper
- [05:35] into openi or google adk
- [05:38] google ecosystem you know in your
- [05:40] company then you can choose one of these
- [05:42] two. To learn some of these frameworks.
- [05:44] I have complete tutorials. I will
- [05:46] provide link of all these tutorials
- [05:48] below so you can have like a complete
- [05:50] crash course. Now talking about no code
- [05:53] we have n and make there are many other
- [05:56] tools out there but n is kind of very
- [05:59] popular nowadays. So let me just show
- [06:01] you. So n provides this kind of low code
- [06:06] um agent building. So let's say if you
- [06:08] are a person who doesn't know coding,
- [06:10] you are a marketing person, you are a
- [06:12] salesperson and you want to use drag and
- [06:14] drop to build agentic workflows then
- [06:17] nitn and even make.com is perfect for
- [06:21] you. Here you're using graphical user
- [06:23] interface. You can see see you can
- [06:25] integrate with different platforms like
- [06:27] HubSpot, Outlook and you know you can
- [06:32] integrate different models like
- [06:33] anthropic or Google Gemini you can
- [06:35] connect with Postgress and so on you can
- [06:38] then send a message to uh the Slack
- [06:40] channel. So these kind of low code
- [06:43] frameworks are making it easy for
- [06:46] non-technical folks to build agentic AI
- [06:48] workflows.
- [06:50] All right folks so which framework is
- [06:52] the best? Well, it depends. If you don't
- [06:56] want to do coding, if you want to build
- [06:58] agents using no code uh graphical user
- [07:02] interface, then go with nine or make. If
- [07:05] you want to build customized workflows,
- [07:07] right? And uh if you want to build very
- [07:10] fast agents, then go with agno. If you
- [07:14] want to build uh super customized
- [07:17] stateful agents, then go with langraph.
- [07:20] For multi- aents, go with crew AI. And
- [07:22] uh if you are into Google or OpenAI
- [07:24] ecosystem uh you can choose one of these
- [07:27] two. So based on the situation you can
- [07:29] evaluate which framework is the best one
- [07:31] for you. I hope you like this video. If
- [07:33] you have any question post in the
- [07:34] comment box below. If you if you like
- [07:37] the content, please give it a thumbs up
