- [00:00] So Gemini's new file search API is
- [00:01] awesome because it allows you to drop in
- [00:03] a document. It generates those
- [00:04] embeddings and then you're right away
- [00:05] able to just chat with it and ask it
- [00:07] questions and get answers back. So that
- [00:09] functionality along with the fact that
- [00:11] they're offering it for a super super
- [00:12] cheap price is probably why you've been
- [00:14] seeing it on your feeds lately. So today
- [00:16] I'm going to be talking about how we can
- [00:17] use it in Naden for our rag agents
- [00:19] without having to build a huge massive
- [00:21] data pipeline that looks like this
- [00:23] because we're able to just drop in a
- [00:24] file and get answers back. But I will
- [00:26] say it's not completely magic. So
- [00:28] everything that we're doing today, I'm
- [00:29] going to try to be as honest as I can
- [00:31] about it. So just to start off before we
- [00:33] actually get into niten and start
- [00:34] building things. What is Gemini file
- [00:36] search? So how does it work? Basically
- [00:38] you upload your files to Gemini. It
- [00:40] automatically chunks and embeds them and
- [00:42] then you can have your nitni agents
- [00:44] using this as knowledge. So if you've
- [00:46] ever built like a rag agent before with
- [00:48] a vector database like pine cone or
- [00:49] superbase, it's super super similar
- [00:51] except for once again we're cutting out
- [00:53] basically all of this data pipeline
- [00:55] processing where we have to understand
- [00:56] the file type, add metadata, maybe add
- [00:58] context, split it up, run it through an
- [01:00] embeddings model, and then put it into
- [01:01] our vector store. Whereas in this
- [01:03] example, we basically just upload the
- [01:04] doc, we shoot it over to Google, and
- [01:06] then it takes care of everything else.
- [01:07] And then we can go ahead and just have
- [01:09] an AI agent that's plugged into our
- [01:10] Google store and it can start giving us
- [01:12] answers right away. Why is it useful?
- [01:14] You don't have to build your own search
- [01:15] system or database because Gemini
- [01:17] handles that storage and searching. And
- [01:18] what do you need to know? You only need
- [01:20] to know how to upload your files through
- [01:22] Gemini file API. And you don't need all
- [01:24] this special stuff and special technical
- [01:26] setup. And real quick to hit on pricing,
- [01:28] which is why this is pretty exciting.
- [01:30] They only charge you for uploading or
- [01:32] for your indexing or your embedding. So
- [01:34] when you upload a file, you pay 15 cents
- [01:36] for every 1 million tokens processed.
- [01:39] And just to put that into perspective,
- [01:40] right here I've got a 121page PDF and
- [01:44] this was about 95,000 tokens. So not
- [01:46] even a tenth of what would cost you 15.
- [01:50] So it's really really affordable. And
- [01:51] then also when you look at the storage,
- [01:53] it stores everything as of right now for
- [01:55] completely free regardless of how much
- [01:57] you have in there. And then as far as
- [01:59] querying it, there is some sort of limit
- [02:00] when you get really really high on your
- [02:02] queries, but basically all you'll be
- [02:03] paying for on your queries is the chat
- [02:05] model usage. So this table is assuming
- [02:08] that you're using 100 GB of storage and
- [02:10] 1 million queries per month. And so this
- [02:12] is where with Gemini it would cost you
- [02:14] nothing to store. It would cost you
- [02:15] almost 12 bucks to index all of that but
- [02:17] just one time. And then you might hit
- [02:19] some sort of base fee just because
- [02:20] you're doing so many queries per month
- [02:22] and that's going to be like let's just
- [02:23] call it 35 bucks for this first month.
- [02:26] Now for something like Superbase where
- [02:27] you do like a PG vector extension, it's
- [02:29] still pretty affordable. It just takes a
- [02:31] lot more on you for technical setup and
- [02:33] kind of maintenance there. And then when
- [02:35] you compare something like Pine Cone
- [02:36] Assistant or OpenAI Vector Store, which
- [02:38] is essentially the same value prop as
- [02:40] Gemini File Search where you just drop
- [02:41] in docs and then you can chat with them
- [02:43] right away. These, as you can see, are
- [02:45] charging you a lot more for storage. And
- [02:47] then you've also got costs here for
- [02:48] indexing and querying. And also with the
- [02:50] Pine Cone Assistant, you get charged
- [02:52] like 5 cents every hour that this thing
- [02:54] is running. So over time, that also
- [02:57] stacks up. And I did not include that
- [02:58] cost in this table. And so once again,
- [03:01] just a visualization, Gemini is super
- [03:03] cheap when it comes to this file search
- [03:04] API. You may be able to get cheaper if
- [03:06] you go a different route, but
- [03:08] considering how easy and quick it is to
- [03:09] just set up a Gemini file search API and
- [03:12] rag agent, that cost is justified. All
- [03:16] right, so we're about to switch over and
- [03:17] we're going to actually start looking at
- [03:18] the Gemini file search. But I wanted to
- [03:20] say at the end of this video, I am going
- [03:22] to come back and just do a little bit of
- [03:23] some final considerations and things to
- [03:25] think about. So when we get into any
- [03:27] end, there's going to be four HTTP
- [03:29] requests that you guys will be looking
- [03:30] at, and I'm going to walk through
- [03:31] exactly how I set them up. The first one
- [03:33] is going to be us actually creating that
- [03:35] store. And so right now, I'm just going
- [03:36] to refer to it as a folder, cuz I think
- [03:38] that that just makes things a little
- [03:39] easier to contextualize. So the first
- [03:41] one we're going to do is we're going to
- [03:42] make a folder. The next request we have
- [03:43] to do is actually upload a file. And so
- [03:46] we upload it to just like the Google
- [03:47] Cloud environment, but that doesn't yet
- [03:49] mean it's in the folder. So the third
- [03:51] HTTP request that we have to make is
- [03:53] we're going to take this file and we're
- [03:54] going to move it into the folder that we
- [03:56] created earlier in step one. And then
- [03:58] finally, we have to set up the actual
- [03:59] request to query it. So we're going to
- [04:01] hook up an AI agent to the tool and then
- [04:03] we'll be able to chat with it to get all
- [04:04] of the information that is in this file,
- [04:07] which will be in this folder that we
- [04:10] created. All right, so here's what it
- [04:11] looks like in NN. We've got the create
- [04:13] store, we've got the upload file, and we
- [04:14] have the query. And then after I show
- [04:16] you guys how all of this works, we're
- [04:17] going to run a quick evaluation to see
- [04:19] how accurate the results actually are
- [04:21] coming back. Okay, so I already have all
- [04:23] of this built out for you guys. If you
- [04:24] want to download it for completely free,
- [04:25] so you can just plug in your own
- [04:26] information, you can do so by joining my
- [04:28] free school community. The link for that
- [04:30] is down in the description. I also just
- [04:31] recorded a full step-by-step breakdown
- [04:33] of this in my plus community if you want
- [04:35] to check that out where I do other live
- [04:37] builds and we've got full courses in
- [04:38] here as well. So if that interests you,
- [04:40] go check it out. So anyways, the way
- [04:41] that this works is we're setting up our
- [04:43] HTTP requests. And the way that I knew
- [04:45] how to set this up was by looking at the
- [04:47] file search API documentation. And I'm
- [04:50] going to be honest, this API
- [04:52] documentation from Google. And most of
- [04:53] Google's are not my favorite. They're
- [04:56] not super intuitive. They're very
- [04:57] confusing. And so I will show you guys
- [04:59] where I found the operations that we
- [05:01] need to do. But once again, you can
- [05:02] download this workflow for free and just
- [05:04] plug in your key information. So you can
- [05:07] see this is our file search API. We have
- [05:09] different scenarios like directly
- [05:10] uploading to file search store. We can
- [05:12] import files. We can learn how the
- [05:14] chunking works. We can look at the
- [05:15] metadata and citations and stuff like
- [05:17] that. And also another cool tip that I
- [05:19] saw from Mark Hashef is you can actually
- [05:21] go ahead and view as markdown and then
- [05:23] you could paste in all of this
- [05:25] information to an LLM and it could help
- [05:26] you set up some requests. It's
- [05:28] definitely not perfect and you have to
- [05:29] work with it a little bit. So that's why
- [05:30] I'm here to just show you what to do. So
- [05:32] the way that I went about this is I went
- [05:34] down to the second one which is
- [05:35] importing files and I kind of followed
- [05:37] this order of operations. So the first
- [05:40] thing that you can see what we have to
- [05:41] do is we have to create a file search
- [05:43] store. So what I did is I saw that this
- [05:45] was a post request. I grabbed this whole
- [05:47] endpoint right here and I'm going to
- [05:49] throw this into this HTTP request right
- [05:51] there. Now, I'm not going to dive into
- [05:53] the nitty-gritties of setting up an HTTP
- [05:55] request, but one thing that I know just
- [05:57] because I've done it so many times is
- [05:58] when you see a question mark in the URL,
- [06:01] this basically just means that anything
- [06:02] following that question mark is a query
- [06:05] parameter. And so, you can see our query
- [06:07] parameter is a key and then we need to
- [06:09] go get a Gemini API key. So, if you're
- [06:11] in this documentation page, you can
- [06:12] click up here to get API key. Or you
- [06:14] could go to Google AI Studio and then
- [06:16] you'll find when you create your
- [06:17] profile, you can create a key right
- [06:19] here, which I will just go ahead and
- [06:20] call test. Throw that in there. And then
- [06:23] when I get this key, it will give me
- [06:25] this value, which I can go ahead and
- [06:26] copy and go back into edit. And you
- [06:29] would just be pasting this right in here
- [06:30] where I have my query parameter that
- [06:32] says key, and then I've got that value.
- [06:34] Now, that's one way you can do it. And I
- [06:36] have the rest of the template set up so
- [06:37] that you can do that. But a much better
- [06:39] way to do it so that you don't have to
- [06:41] go copy and paste your key every time is
- [06:43] to create an authentication up here. So
- [06:45] we know this is a query parameter. So
- [06:47] I'm going to choose generic. I'm going
- [06:48] to go to generic type and choose query.
- [06:50] And then I'm going to create a new query
- [06:52] off where I basically for the name just
- [06:54] type in key for the value. Paste in that
- [06:56] API key. And then I'm just going to name
- [06:58] this Google demo 1119.
- [07:02] And so I can save that. And now I know
- [07:04] exactly what query off that this is. And
- [07:06] I can use this every time rather than
- [07:08] sending over these query parameters. So
- [07:10] anyways, I've got my header content type
- [07:12] in here. And then the most important
- [07:13] thing that you need to do in this
- [07:15] request is choose the name for your file
- [07:18] store. So I'm going to call my file
- [07:19] store YouTube- test. And then I'm just
- [07:22] going to go ahead and execute this step.
- [07:24] And you can see that we got this success
- [07:26] message back from Google, which is
- [07:27] basically saying, okay, here's the name
- [07:29] of your file store. Here's the display
- [07:31] name. And here's the time that we
- [07:32] created it. And so right now I'm just
- [07:33] going to pin this data so we can save it
- [07:35] because we're going to have to come back
- [07:36] and use this name in the next step.
- [07:38] Okay, so we created our file store. The
- [07:40] next thing we need to do is we need to
- [07:41] upload the file to Google and then we
- [07:44] have to move it into that file store. So
- [07:46] real quick, what I'm going to do is just
- [07:48] delete this connection. We're going to
- [07:49] go ahead and pull up this form
- [07:51] submission trigger which just makes me
- [07:53] drop in a document. And I just dropped
- [07:55] in this PDF which is the rules of golf.
- [07:57] And it's like a 22page PDF or something
- [07:59] like that. Now, let's go into this HTTP
- [08:01] request and take a look at what we're
- [08:02] doing. So, the way that I found out how
- [08:04] to configure this one was back in the
- [08:06] API documentation. You can see that
- [08:07] after we created our file search store,
- [08:09] we needed to initiate resumable upload
- [08:11] to the store. So, I went ahead and
- [08:13] grabbed this post request. I grabbed
- [08:15] this URL right here. As you can see, it
- [08:18] ends in files. And then I threw in right
- [08:19] here this URL. And then we have our
- [08:22] query parameter which I'm actually going
- [08:23] to get rid of because as you guys saw we
- [08:25] just set up a query off together which
- [08:27] was Google demo 1119 right there. And
- [08:29] then the last thing that we actually
- [08:30] need to send over is the actual noden
- [08:32] file. So right here for the body we're
- [08:34] choosing naden binary file which is
- [08:36] right over here. You can tell it's
- [08:38] binary because you have schema table
- [08:40] JSON and then binary. And that's where
- [08:41] it shows up. And so all you have to do
- [08:44] is copy whatever the name is right here
- [08:45] of that binary file and then put it in
- [08:47] there. So that's why I'm saying file.
- [08:49] Those two things match up. And I can go
- [08:51] ahead and execute this step. And what
- [08:52] this is going to do is it's going to
- [08:54] tell us that our file is now in the
- [08:56] Google environment. So what it does is
- [08:58] it temporarily holds this file, which is
- [09:00] why you see an expiration time. So if
- [09:02] you don't move it into a folder by this
- [09:04] date, it will expire. So you can see we
- [09:06] got a name, we got a mime type, we have
- [09:08] a size, we have a URI, we have a state,
- [09:10] we have a source, and that's just some
- [09:12] metadata about this. And this is
- [09:14] basically just our success message from
- [09:15] Google. So moving on to the next one.
- [09:18] What we have to do is actually move that
- [09:19] file that's up in Google's cloud into
- [09:21] our folder. So I'm going to go back once
- [09:23] again into the API documentation. You
- [09:25] can see that there's one right here
- [09:27] which is import files into the right
- [09:29] store. So I would basically grab this
- [09:31] request. I then came into this HTTP
- [09:33] request and pasted it right in here. And
- [09:35] what you notice is that we have a
- [09:37] variable to configure because right here
- [09:39] you can see it's asking for our store
- [09:41] name. Now the reason why we have to do
- [09:42] it in the endpoint is because it didn't
- [09:44] come after the question mark. So, it's
- [09:46] not actually a query parameter. So,
- [09:48] that's why we have to copy and paste the
- [09:49] name of our file store in the actual
- [09:51] URL. So, I'm going to go back into this
- [09:53] first node where we got that. I'm going
- [09:55] to copy this name right here of our file
- [09:57] store and then open up this import file
- [10:00] node and we're going to delete this and
- [10:02] we're going to paste in the name of our
- [10:04] file store right there. I'm going to go
- [10:05] ahead and get rid of our query
- [10:06] parameters because we already set that
- [10:08] up together. We've got our headers we're
- [10:09] sending over. And then finally for the
- [10:11] JSON body, we just need to send over the
- [10:13] name of the file that we just uploaded.
- [10:15] So on this left-h hand side, we had the
- [10:17] upload file operation and it gave us a
- [10:19] name. I basically just dragged in that
- [10:21] name right there. And now if we execute
- [10:23] this step, we're going to get a success
- [10:25] message from Google that's telling us
- [10:26] that our file has been put into that
- [10:29] folder. All right, so we made our
- [10:31] folder, we uploaded the file, and then
- [10:33] we moved that file into that folder. So
- [10:35] now we're ready to actually test out the
- [10:37] agent and see if it can understand what
- [10:39] is in that PDF that we just gave it. So
- [10:41] the way that this knowledgebased tool
- [10:43] works is it is another HTTP request. So
- [10:46] of course I went to the API
- [10:47] documentation and I saw this request
- [10:49] right here which is to generate content
- [10:51] which just means it's going to get an
- [10:52] answer back for us. So I grabbed the
- [10:54] endpoint right here. You can see that
- [10:55] it's using Gemini 2.5 flash as the
- [10:57] model. I saw the header parameters. I
- [10:59] saw it was a post and then I saw the
- [11:00] actual body of the request that we need
- [11:02] to send over. And what you'll notice is
- [11:04] in the body, it asks us for a store
- [11:06] name. So once again, what we'd want to
- [11:08] do is we'd go all the way back up here.
- [11:10] We would grab the name of the file store
- [11:12] that we want to search in. And then we
- [11:14] would open up this HTTP request and we
- [11:16] would make sure that it goes right in
- [11:17] here. And now it knows to look in that
- [11:20] file store. Now, the other thing that we
- [11:22] had to configure was this from AI
- [11:23] function for the actual query that we're
- [11:25] sending to the file store. And so what I
- [11:27] did is I used the from AI function,
- [11:28] which basically just means that the
- [11:29] agent that controls this tool will make
- [11:31] the query. And I told it that the query
- [11:33] is the question that the user needs an
- [11:35] answer to. So it will be filling in the
- [11:37] information here. And I'll show you guys
- [11:38] what I mean by that when we actually run
- [11:40] a demo. But then finally for the actual
- [11:41] prompt, I kept it really simple. I said
- [11:43] you are a helpful rag agent. Your job is
- [11:45] to answer the user's question using your
- [11:46] knowledgebased tool to make sure all of
- [11:48] your answers are grounded in truth.
- [11:49] Please site your sources when you're
- [11:51] giving your answers. When you are
- [11:52] sending a query to the knowledgebased
- [11:54] tool, only send over text, no
- [11:55] punctuation, question marks, or new
- [11:57] lines just to keep the JSON body from
- [11:58] breaking. So here's the rules of golf
- [12:00] PDF that I uploaded. Let's just go ahead
- [12:02] and ask a basic question to see if it's
- [12:04] working. So, I'm going to ask the agent,
- [12:05] what happens if your club breaks during
- [12:07] the round. All right, so I just shot
- [12:08] that off. It's going to use its brain.
- [12:10] It's going to call the knowledgebased
- [12:11] tool, and then we should see a correct
- [12:12] answer that also tells us where it got
- [12:14] it from. Okay, so we just got this back.
- [12:16] It says, "Short answer. If a club breaks
- [12:17] during the round because of normal play,
- [12:19] you may continue to use the damaged
- [12:20] club, have it repaired, or replace it
- [12:22] during the round. But if it breaks for
- [12:24] non-normal reasons, you may not use that
- [12:26] club for the remainder of the round, and
- [12:27] you may not repair it until after the
- [12:29] round." It showed us the source was from
- [12:31] the knowledge base from this document
- [12:32] and then rule 4 clubs. Okay, so that's
- [12:35] how it handles one document in there.
- [12:37] Let's go ahead and throw in another one
- [12:38] and see what that's like. So, we already
- [12:40] have this pipeline configured. I should
- [12:42] be able to just pull up this form, drop
- [12:44] in another file, which is completely
- [12:46] different. This one's about Nvidia, and
- [12:47] it should upload the file and import it
- [12:49] into the correct store once again. Okay,
- [12:52] so that was quick. It looks like it's
- [12:53] already done. I'm just going to go ahead
- [12:55] and ask some random question about
- [12:56] Nvidia, and we will see if it is able to
- [12:58] pull it. Okay, so I just asked it to
- [13:00] give me a Q1205 fiscal summary for
- [13:03] Nvidia. All right, so we got that back
- [13:04] and we see, okay, here is a concise Q1
- [13:08] fiscal summary for Nvidia. We've got
- [13:09] total revenue 26 billion, data center
- [13:11] revenue 22 billion. We've got a gap
- [13:13] gross margin. We've got some other stats
- [13:15] like this. And you can see that this
- [13:16] came from the Nvidia press release.
- [13:18] Nvidia announces financial results for
- [13:20] first quarter fiscal year 2025, April
- [13:22] 28th, 2024. And if I go to the document
- [13:25] that this actually pulled from, you can
- [13:27] see that this is in fact correct. But
- [13:29] you still of course want to know that
- [13:31] this is grounded in truth. And you could
- [13:33] prompt your agent to make sure they're
- [13:34] always giving you like exact quotes and
- [13:36] things like that. And so if I real quick
- [13:38] just actually click into this
- [13:39] knowledgebased tool, we can go ahead and
- [13:41] see the output that it got. And what
- [13:43] you'll see is first of all, we get a
- [13:44] candidates array. And in this candidates
- [13:46] array, we see the actual text of the
- [13:48] real answer that the Gemini model was
- [13:51] able to get to based on all of the data
- [13:53] that it was looking through. But then
- [13:54] from there, if we go further down, we
- [13:56] can actually see grounding metadata. So
- [13:58] this means these are all the actual
- [14:00] chunks that it pulled in order to get to
- [14:01] that conclusion that we just saw. This
- [14:03] is an actual chunk that it pulled from
- [14:05] its file store. And if we keep going
- [14:07] down, we'll see more. We can see chunk
- [14:09] two. And we can also see where each
- [14:10] chunk came from as far as which folder
- [14:12] it was in. Chunk three, chunk four. and
- [14:14] we get all these different chunks. We're
- [14:16] also able to see grounding supports. So,
- [14:17] this will pull different explicit
- [14:19] sentences and things like that out of
- [14:21] the chunks and it will tell us where it
- [14:22] started and where it ended. And you can
- [14:24] go ahead and verify all of this stuff in
- [14:26] your document as well. So, I just wanted
- [14:28] to give you guys some quick insight of
- [14:29] what the tool actually comes back with
- [14:31] and then how your agents work together
- [14:32] in order to give you the right answer.
- [14:34] Now, of course, we actually want to test
- [14:36] this. So, what I'm going to do is I'm
- [14:37] going to upload one more file using this
- [14:38] flow right here, and then I'm going to
- [14:40] run this evaluation where we're testing
- [14:42] this agent on these 10 different
- [14:44] questions, and we're going to see how
- [14:45] accurate it's able to answer them. Okay,
- [14:47] so we've got three total PDFs in our
- [14:50] store. We have the rules of golf, which
- [14:52] is 22page PDF. We've got the Nvidia
- [14:55] announcement, which was nine pages. And
- [14:56] then we have Apple's 10K, which was 121
- [14:59] pages. And we've got 10 different
- [15:00] questions across all three of these
- [15:02] different PDFs. and we're going to go
- [15:04] ahead and see how well it does. So, I'm
- [15:06] running the evaluation right now. I will
- [15:08] check back in with you guys when we get
- [15:09] these results. Okay, so we just got that
- [15:12] finished up. You can see the first run I
- [15:13] actually had the wrong API key put in.
- [15:15] So, it errored eight times in a row. But
- [15:18] on the second run, things went much
- [15:19] better. So, what we see here is that it
- [15:21] got a 4.2 correctness, which is out of
- [15:23] five. So, on these questions, it was
- [15:25] able to get five, five, four, five. It
- [15:27] had one tough one with a two, but these
- [15:29] questions were really tough. And keep in
- [15:31] mind that we dropped in basically almost
- [15:33] 200 pages worth of PDFs and we didn't do
- [15:36] anything special and hardly even any
- [15:38] prompting. We basically just had the
- [15:39] agent take its best shot at it. And
- [15:41] these PDFs were about Apple, Nvidia, and
- [15:44] golf. So they just really didn't have
- [15:45] any correlation, but we shoved them all
- [15:47] in the same store as well. So anyways,
- [15:49] just to kind of wrap up here, we have
- [15:50] some final considerations that I wanted
- [15:52] to talk about when it comes to RAG in
- [15:55] general as well as this specific Gemini
- [15:58] file search API. And so the first three
- [16:00] honestly just kind of fall under the
- [16:01] umbrella of the fact that this is not
- [16:03] magic. It's great that you can drop in
- [16:05] these files, but what happens if you
- [16:06] need to update a file and throw it back
- [16:08] in? Now you have duplicate data because
- [16:10] Google isn't really keeping a record of
- [16:11] all of this data and making sure that
- [16:13] things aren't duplicated or that old
- [16:14] ones need to be updated and deleted,
- [16:16] things like that. And if you keep on
- [16:18] exploding your database with duplicate
- [16:19] data, it's going to lower the quality of
- [16:21] your agents responses. And you also have
- [16:23] to remember that garbage in is garbage
- [16:24] out. So, yes, Gemini's file search API
- [16:27] does utilize some OCR and stuff like
- [16:29] that to make sure it can understand
- [16:31] what's actually going on in your
- [16:32] documents, but if it is super messy or
- [16:35] if it was scanned bad or if it just
- [16:36] doesn't make sense going in, it's not
- [16:38] going to make any sense going out. And
- [16:39] so, sometimes you may need to do some
- [16:41] pre-processing before you drop in those
- [16:42] files to Gemini. Now, this one is also
- [16:45] super important because sometimes you
- [16:47] just don't want to do chunkbased
- [16:48] retrieval. Semantic search is good for
- [16:50] being quick and cost-effective when you
- [16:52] need to find basically a needle in a hay
- [16:54] stack. But if you need a context of the
- [16:56] entire document or transcript or video
- [16:58] or whatever it is, you should not be
- [17:00] using chunk based retrieval unless
- [17:01] you're getting really really granular
- [17:03] with some metadata tagging and things
- [17:04] like that. But ultimately, it's just not
- [17:06] the best path. I did an example in my
- [17:08] community where I basically had this
- [17:10] document in there and I asked it, "How
- [17:12] many total rules are in your PDF?" And
- [17:14] it came back and said five. Because it
- [17:16] actually couldn't look through the
- [17:17] entire document in one swoop. It had to
- [17:19] basically chunk it up and look at just
- [17:21] individual chunks. But of course, if I
- [17:22] asked about the last rule, which is rule
- [17:24] 28, it would get it right. And then
- [17:26] finally, just about security and
- [17:27] privacy, your documents are being
- [17:29] uploaded and stored on Google's servers.
- [17:31] And so, if you're doing this, just make
- [17:33] sure that you're not uploading anything
- [17:34] that has sensitive information like PII
- [17:37] because Google will process and index
- [17:39] that data. So, it will no longer be
- [17:40] private. And of course, every situation
- [17:42] is different. So, just think about the
- [17:43] rules or company regulations or industry
- [17:46] regulations, things like GDPR, HIPPA, or
- [17:48] CCPA. But anyways, that's going to do it
- [17:50] for this one. I don't want the video to
- [17:51] go too long. Just a reminder, if you
