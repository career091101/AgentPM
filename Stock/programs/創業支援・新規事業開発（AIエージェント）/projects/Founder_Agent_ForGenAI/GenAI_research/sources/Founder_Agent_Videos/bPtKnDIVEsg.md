- [00:00] Hey guys, in today's video I'm going to
- [00:02] show you how you can deploy agents from
- [00:04] Google's new agent development kit to
- [00:06] the cloud. More specifically, I'm going
- [00:08] to walk you through the full process of
- [00:09] deploying your agents to Google's agent
- [00:12] deployment service called Agent Engine.
- [00:14] And by the end of this video, you'll
- [00:15] have your first agent deployed to the
- [00:17] cloud, ready to respond to your real
- [00:19] world request. And because you guys are
- [00:21] awesome, I'm going to be giving away all
- [00:22] the source code in this video, plus some
- [00:24] step-by-step instructions completely for
- [00:26] free, so you can build and deploy your
- [00:28] own agents on your own time. Just check
- [00:30] out the link down description below so
- [00:31] you can go ahead and download everything
- [00:32] today. And don't worry if you're new to
- [00:34] Agent Development Kit or the cloud. I'm
- [00:36] going to be breaking down everything
- [00:37] step by step, so it's as easy as
- [00:39] possible to follow. And if you get stuck
- [00:41] or have questions for whatever reason,
- [00:42] feel free to drop a comment down below.
- [00:44] Or you can head over to my free school
- [00:45] community where you can talk with me and
- [00:47] other like-minded AI developers so we
- [00:49] can get you unstuck and moving on your
- [00:50] projects. But enough talking, let's go
- [00:52] ahead and do a quick overview of the
- [00:53] core technologies you're going to be
- [00:54] using today so that we're on the same
- [00:56] page. And then we're going to head over
- [00:57] to the five steps you need to follow to
- [00:59] deploy your local agents to the cloud.
- [01:01] So let's go ahead and dive in. All
- [01:02] right, guys. So before we dive into
- [01:04] actually building out and deploying all
- [01:05] of our agents to the cloud, we need to
- [01:07] understand the core two technologies
- [01:09] we're going to be using today. Agent
- [01:10] Development Kit and then Vertex AI agent
- [01:13] engine. So let's explain what they are
- [01:14] and how they work together to deploy
- [01:16] agents. All right, first things first is
- [01:17] going to be agent development kit. Agent
- [01:19] Development Kit is Google's new agentic
- [01:22] framework that allows you to build out
- [01:24] agents. So if you've used Langchain or
- [01:27] Crew AI, Lum Index, any of these agent
- [01:29] frameworks, it is exactly like that. So
- [01:31] you'll probably recognize a lot of these
- [01:34] instructions for creating an agent to
- [01:36] where you pass in a model that you want
- [01:37] the agent to use. Give it a name and
- [01:39] then pass in some instructions on like
- [01:41] all right agent. Here's exactly what you
- [01:42] need to go off to do. So it should be
- [01:44] super familiar to you. A few other cool
- [01:45] points to note is agent development kit.
- [01:48] You can actually pass in any model. So
- [01:50] you could pass in an open AI model, a
- [01:51] cloud model, any of them. You're not
- [01:53] stuck using the Gemini models from
- [01:54] Google. And it is completely free to use
- [01:57] just like it is to use link chain or
- [01:59] crew AAI. It's actually an open source
- [02:00] repository, so you can actually go in,
- [02:02] look at the source code, download it,
- [02:03] make pull request, whatever you want to
- [02:05] do. Now, that's how we're going to
- [02:06] create our agents. And then now we need
- [02:08] to talk about step number two, which is
- [02:10] going to be deploying our agents. And
- [02:11] we're going to do that through Vert.Ex
- [02:13] AI agent engine. This is Google's
- [02:15] platform to make agent deployment as
- [02:17] easy as possible. Without a tool like
- [02:20] this, creating agents and actually
- [02:21] deploying them can be a ton of work, and
- [02:23] they've done a really good job of
- [02:24] simplifying the whole process and making
- [02:26] it super affordable. So, a few things
- [02:28] that you need to know inside agent
- [02:30] engine, you can actually pass in any
- [02:32] type of framework you want. So, I think
- [02:34] they have a really good chart down here
- [02:35] that explains it all. So, within agent
- [02:37] engine, this is where you'll actually be
- [02:39] like deploying all of your agents. You
- [02:41] can actually pass in any agent framework
- [02:43] you want. You could pass in crewi, lang
- [02:45] chain, llama index, any agent framework
- [02:47] you want. You can pass it in and deploy
- [02:49] it through agent engine. And then once a
- [02:51] agent is deployed, you can actually go
- [02:53] off and make requests to it almost like
- [02:55] you would just a regular API. So you can
- [02:57] say like, hey agent, take in this
- [02:59] request. Agent engine is going to host
- [03:01] it, deploy it, and actually run the
- [03:02] agent and then spit back the answer to
- [03:04] you. Makes it super super easy to do.
- [03:06] And a few other things that I think are
- [03:08] pretty cool that you would like to know
- [03:09] is when it comes to pricing, it's
- [03:11] actually super super affordable. It is a
- [03:13] pay as you go model to where you only
- [03:15] pay as the agent is running, which is
- [03:17] super important to me because I don't
- [03:18] want to be racking up a huge bill of
- [03:20] like hundreds of dollars if the agent
- [03:22] only gets triggered once. So basically
- [03:23] the way it works is, you know, whenever
- [03:25] you send a request off to the agent,
- [03:27] it's going to start tracking its time
- [03:28] and say, "Okay, cool. It looks like I
- [03:30] ran for a total of 3 minutes." And along
- [03:33] the way, I used 10,000 tokens. So you're
- [03:36] automatically going to pay for the
- [03:37] tokens you use. And then on top of that,
- [03:38] you're going to pay for the resources
- [03:40] that you used. So you can see you're
- [03:42] going to pay basically for CPU usage and
- [03:44] memory. So if you were to run all in all
- [03:46] for an hour, you can expect to pay
- [03:48] around 11 cent if you used one core and
- [03:51] 1 gigabyte. So all around very
- [03:53] affordable, which was I was super
- [03:55] impressed with. So very excited that
- [03:56] they've made it easy to deploy and
- [03:58] basically very affordable as well. All
- [04:00] right. So, now that we've talked about
- [04:01] what are the two tools we're using, now
- [04:03] it's time for us to actually go ahead
- [04:04] and see how we're going to create our
- [04:06] agents with Agent Development Kit and
- [04:08] then easily go ahead and deploy them
- [04:09] over to Agent Engine over in Vertex AI.
- [04:12] So, if you have any questions on any of
- [04:14] that, feel free drop a question down
- [04:15] below. I know these are some like more
- [04:16] advanced, bigger topics, but let's go
- [04:18] ahead now and head into the five core
- [04:20] steps you need to go from agent to
- [04:22] deployed agent. So, let's go ahead and
- [04:23] dive in. Okay, so now that we've talked
- [04:25] about the two tools you're going to be
- [04:26] using, Agent Development Kit and Agent
- [04:28] Engine, let's go ahead and cover at a
- [04:30] high level the five steps you need to
- [04:32] take to deploy your agents to the cloud.
- [04:34] So, first things first, we are going to
- [04:37] create an agent using ADK. So, I already
- [04:39] have a pre-built one for you that you
- [04:41] can just go ahead and download for free
- [04:42] down in the description below. Once we
- [04:44] have our agent set up on our local
- [04:46] computer, then we need to go ahead and
- [04:48] start setting up our cloud resources.
- [04:50] So, first we're going to go ahead and
- [04:51] create a new project in Google Cloud
- [04:53] Platform. From there, inside Google
- [04:55] Cloud Platform, we're going to enable
- [04:57] and set up our AI resources. Once we
- [04:59] have the cloud set up to support all the
- [05:01] AI functionality, we're on our local
- [05:03] computer going to installed Google Cloud
- [05:06] CLI. This is going to allow us to log
- [05:08] in, access our cloud resources, and it's
- [05:10] going to enable us to connect to Vertex
- [05:13] AI so that we can actually start to run
- [05:15] our agent locally because it'll have
- [05:17] access to our Gemini keys and everything
- [05:19] else we need to run it. And then
- [05:20] finally, once it's up and working and
- [05:22] everything's installed, we can then go
- [05:24] ahead and deploy our agent to the cloud.
- [05:26] And I have scripts and everything else
- [05:28] that you need to make this as easy as
- [05:29] possible. Like I said, I've tried to
- [05:31] break down everything step by step. So
- [05:32] let's go ahead and hop over to the first
- [05:34] step where we are going to look at the
- [05:36] agent that we are going to deploying to
- [05:38] the cloud today. So let's go ahead and
- [05:39] hit to step number one. So welcome to
- [05:40] step number one where we're going to do
- [05:41] a quick overview of the agent that we're
- [05:44] going to be deploying to the cloud
- [05:45] today. So at a high level what we're
- [05:47] doing is I've built a shortbot agent for
- [05:49] you guys which all it does is this agent
- [05:51] takes in a message and then makes it as
- [05:54] short as possible to get the same
- [05:56] message across. So, as you can see, this
- [05:58] looks just like lang chain and crewi
- [06:01] where you pass a name, model, and
- [06:02] description. You pass in your
- [06:04] instructions here where you basically go
- [06:06] ahead and say like, hey, this is the
- [06:07] task you're trying to perform. And what
- [06:10] you can also see is you can pass in
- [06:12] tools just like you would normally do
- [06:13] with lang chain or crewi. So, inside the
- [06:16] tools, you just go ahead and make a
- [06:18] normal Python function, give it a
- [06:21] parameters, give it the types, give it a
- [06:23] dock string of what it should do, and
- [06:24] then all the code that needs to run.
- [06:26] Like I said, this is more of a
- [06:27] deployment tutorial, so we're not
- [06:28] getting super fancy with the underlying
- [06:30] agent. Okay, so first things first, I
- [06:33] have set up instructions for you guys so
- [06:35] that you can easily install this and run
- [06:37] it locally. So, if you head over to the
- [06:39] readme after you download this source
- [06:41] code for free, what you can see is I
- [06:43] have basically step-by-step instructions
- [06:45] to where you guys can, you know, go
- [06:47] ahead and install the project. And to
- [06:49] install it, you're going to need to use
- [06:51] Poetry. Don't worry if you run into any
- [06:52] issues. drop a comment down below or you
- [06:54] can go ahead and actually talk to Tit
- [06:57] and it'll walk you through installing
- [06:58] Poetry on your local computer. Once you
- [06:59] have installed Poetry, all you need to
- [07:01] do is run poetry install and this is
- [07:04] going to go off and install all the
- [07:05] necessary dependencies that you need to
- [07:07] actually run this project. Everything
- [07:10] from the Google Agent Development Kit,
- [07:12] which is the main one, and all the other
- [07:14] tools you need for deploying and
- [07:15] everything else. So, that's what's going
- [07:16] on at a high level. And then what you
- [07:18] can do next is go ahead and activate the
- [07:21] environment that you just created. And
- [07:23] what this will allow you to do is
- [07:24] actually run commands. Specifically,
- [07:26] what you can do now is down here, what
- [07:28] I've showed you guys is you can actually
- [07:30] go ahead and start to run your agent.
- [07:33] Now, what you can do is just type in ADK
- [07:35] web. And what this will do is it'll go
- [07:37] ahead and spin up the web version of
- [07:40] this agent so that you can begin to chat
- [07:42] with it. Now, I am going a little bit of
- [07:44] ahead and step four will actually go
- [07:46] ahead and install Google Cloud, which
- [07:48] will connect you to Vert.Ex AI, which
- [07:50] will actually allow you to like go ahead
- [07:52] and start running this. So, this won't
- [07:53] work out of the box until we do step
- [07:55] four. I just want to go ahead and give
- [07:56] you a quick overview of the agent. So,
- [07:58] if we head over here, you can see we're
- [08:00] now in the web view of our agent. So, up
- [08:03] here on the top left, you can see all of
- [08:04] our agents that we have running. And
- [08:06] then we can go ahead and start to type
- [08:07] in messages that will get sent to our
- [08:09] shortbot. So, we can say, "Hey, how was
- [08:12] your weekend?" We can say, "Anything
- [08:15] fun? Have fun with the family." And then
- [08:19] what it'll do is it'll go ahead and send
- [08:21] that message off to our agent. And then
- [08:24] our agent will go ahead and type a
- [08:26] response back. Sorry, I actually, this
- [08:28] is on me. I I meant to refresh the page.
- [08:29] So, if we go ahead and send it again,
- [08:31] what it'll do is it'll go ahead and
- [08:32] actually run. And you can see what I've
- [08:35] told the agent to do is give me the
- [08:36] original character count, the new
- [08:38] character count, and the new message. So
- [08:40] you can see basically what it did is
- [08:42] like hey this was kind of redundant and
- [08:44] what it did is it made it shorter. So
- [08:46] you can see the agent's up and running.
- [08:47] You can dive in to you know seeing the
- [08:50] events that happened, the initial
- [08:51] request that was being passed in the
- [08:53] response. Don't worry if any of this is
- [08:55] confusing. I'm actually going to after
- [08:56] this video create a agent development
- [08:58] kit quick start where I dive deeper and
- [09:00] I'm also going to create an agent
- [09:02] development kit masterass. So I'm going
- [09:03] to have a lot more content coming out
- [09:05] around this but today I just wanted to
- [09:07] focus on deployment. So, as you can see,
- [09:08] our agent is actually up and running and
- [09:10] it works. And you can see that there are
- [09:12] instructions that will walk you through
- [09:14] exactly how to install your agent and
- [09:17] get everything running. Okay, cool. So,
- [09:18] we are officially done on the setup. The
- [09:20] only other things that I do want to
- [09:22] mention that are very important for you
- [09:24] to understand how it all works at a high
- [09:25] level for agent development kit is the
- [09:27] fact that the way agent development kit
- [09:30] works is you create agents through
- [09:32] folders. So you can see we have an ADK
- [09:35] shortbot that is going to be the name of
- [09:38] our agent and then within this folder
- [09:40] you can see I create an agent.py file.
- [09:43] Well that's basically how it works. This
- [09:45] is kind of how they want their structure
- [09:46] of agent set up. So you can see name of
- [09:49] agent here. Then we give the
- [09:50] instructions for the agent. This name
- [09:53] needs to match this name. It's very
- [09:55] important that they match folder and
- [09:57] project name. So that was just one thing
- [09:59] that tripped me up whenever I first
- [10:00] created agents in agent development kit.
- [10:02] So yeah. So, that's everything that you
- [10:03] need to know at a high level when it
- [10:05] comes to creating your agents. And we're
- [10:07] going to go ahead and head over to step
- [10:08] number two where we're going to start
- [10:10] walking you through actually getting
- [10:11] everything set up for the cloud. Let's
- [10:12] go ahead head over to step number two.
- [10:14] So, welcome to step number two where
- [10:15] we're going to create your Google Cloud
- [10:18] Platform account and the project that
- [10:20] you're going to be using to manage all
- [10:22] the resources for our deployed agent.
- [10:25] So, first things first, inside of
- [10:26] Google, just type in GCP cloud and you
- [10:29] should see a link to that will point you
- [10:30] over to Google Cloud. So, we're going to
- [10:32] go ahead and click that. Now, what we
- [10:34] need to do next is if you've never
- [10:36] created a Google Cloud account before,
- [10:38] you're going to want to go ahead and
- [10:39] sign up to create an account. It should
- [10:41] be completely free to do. If anything,
- [10:43] you might need to hook up a payment
- [10:45] method. It's not going to charge you
- [10:47] anything, but you might be asked to
- [10:48] connect a payment method just so that
- [10:50] you can access some of the newer
- [10:51] features. You won't be charged until you
- [10:53] run anything, so don't worry about that,
- [10:55] but just wanted to point that out as an
- [10:56] important note. Great. Once you've
- [10:58] signed up, now it's time for us to go
- [10:59] ahead and go over to our console. So,
- [11:02] you're going to click console. And what
- [11:04] this will do is it'll take you to inside
- [11:06] of Google Cloud Platform. Now, if you
- [11:09] see a screen like this, yours might be a
- [11:10] little bit different if you've never
- [11:11] created a project before, but as you can
- [11:13] see on my screen, I can see I'm in the
- [11:14] Brandon Hancock.io workspace and I'm
- [11:17] working on the deploy ADK quickart
- [11:19] project. Together, we're going to go
- [11:21] ahead and create a new project from
- [11:22] scratch so that we're working from the
- [11:24] same area. So, what I'm going to go
- [11:26] ahead and do is click new project. And
- [11:29] I'm going to call this ADK
- [11:32] shortbot YouTube. So, this is the name
- [11:35] of my project. You don't the naming
- [11:37] really doesn't matter. It's just
- [11:38] something that you'll easily memorize
- [11:40] and recognize when you see it. Now, what
- [11:42] you want to do next is click the billing
- [11:44] account. So, in my case, I have two
- [11:46] billing accounts. You probably will now
- [11:47] have one billing account because you
- [11:49] went through the setup process. So,
- [11:51] click that. And then, when it comes to
- [11:52] your organization, I only have one. And
- [11:53] then location. I only have one either.
- [11:55] So, uh, it should be pretty much just
- [11:57] like this except reflect your
- [11:58] information. So, next we're going to go
- [12:00] ahead and click create. And this will
- [12:02] take a few seconds to create your new
- [12:04] project, spin up all the resources, and
- [12:06] get everything ready. Now, once it's
- [12:08] done, you can click this button right
- [12:10] here to select your project. And you can
- [12:12] see in the top left, it now shows we're
- [12:14] working inside the new project. If for
- [12:16] whatever reason that didn't happen, you
- [12:18] can always just click up here in the top
- [12:19] left and research all the projects that
- [12:21] you have and click the proper one. So
- [12:23] great, we now are done with step two. So
- [12:25] let's go ahead and head over to step
- [12:26] number three where we're going to enable
- [12:28] all of our AI resources. So welcome to
- [12:30] step number three where we're going to
- [12:31] start enabling all of the AI services
- [12:33] inside of your Google Cloud project so
- [12:35] that we can start to deploy our agent.
- [12:38] So first things first, what do we need
- [12:39] to do? We need to enable Vertex AI. So,
- [12:42] what we can do is in the top of our
- [12:44] search bar, type in Vertex AI and you
- [12:46] should see a search result just like
- [12:48] this. We're going to click Vertex AI and
- [12:51] then we are going to click enable all
- [12:53] recommended APIs. And this is going to
- [12:56] create Vertex AI Studio and everything
- [12:58] else that you need in order to start
- [13:00] working with, you know, Vert.ex AI. And
- [13:02] a quick reminder, Vertex AI is also
- [13:05] going to enable us to start using agent
- [13:07] engine, which is the most important
- [13:08] thing that we're trying to use here.
- [13:09] Now, this does take quite a few seconds
- [13:11] to create. So, if you click on this
- [13:13] little notification bell in the top
- [13:14] rightand corner, you can see all of the
- [13:17] different resources and services that
- [13:19] it's enabling. Everything from compute,
- [13:21] notebooks, data flows, everything that
- [13:23] you need. And you can see it also went
- [13:24] off and created a bunch of other
- [13:26] services right here. So, we're going to
- [13:28] let that run. And then what we also need
- [13:30] to do is create a new bucket where we
- [13:33] can start to store our deploy agents.
- [13:36] And what is important to note about
- [13:38] this, I'm just going to show you an
- [13:38] existing project so you can see it in
- [13:40] action. This is something that I created
- [13:42] a while ago. And you can see I made a
- [13:44] bucket which is where we're going to
- [13:46] basically store our deployed agents. And
- [13:48] you can see I made previously an ADK
- [13:51] shortbot and it got deployed to this
- [13:53] bucket. And if you dig in, you can
- [13:54] actually start to see some of the like
- [13:56] all the different folders and resources
- [13:58] stored in order to actually run our
- [14:00] agent. So all this is going to get
- [14:01] stored to the cloud. Okay. So that's
- [14:03] what we're ultimately trying to do. So
- [14:05] what we can type in is bucket. And if
- [14:07] you go to cloud storage bucket, this is
- [14:09] what we're trying to do. And we need to
- [14:10] create a new one. So in our case, you're
- [14:12] going to click create. And then from
- [14:14] here, we're just going to give it a
- [14:15] simple name. So I'm going to call it the
- [14:16] same name as my project. So ADK shortbot
- [14:20] YouTube. And then we can pretty much
- [14:22] click continue for everything else. Now,
- [14:24] it is important to note that this will
- [14:27] cost money, you know, but it's like
- [14:29] insanely cheap. So you can see it cost
- [14:31] almost 3 cent per gigabyte per month and
- [14:34] we're going to be using barely anything.
- [14:36] So like we might get charged a penny per
- [14:38] month with what we're doing here. So
- [14:40] don't worry about it. Like we're not
- [14:41] going to be breaking the bank. So click
- [14:43] continue. Pretty much click continue
- [14:45] through everything and the defaults are
- [14:47] usually great enough. And we're going to
- [14:50] click and continue. The next one is what
- [14:53] we want to do is this one is important.
- [14:55] Enforce public access prevention.
- [14:58] Basically what this mean is, hey, can
- [15:00] the outside world access our stuff? And
- [15:02] the answer is no. We do not want the
- [15:04] outside world accessing information in
- [15:06] this bucket. So that is important that
- [15:08] it stays checked. So we're going to
- [15:09] click continue. We're going to use the
- [15:11] normal soft delete policies and click
- [15:14] continue. Basically, go ahead and just
- [15:16] click everything as the default and you
- [15:18] should be good. So great, our bucket is
- [15:20] now set up. Things are great. And if you
- [15:22] go back to our notification bell, you
- [15:24] can also see that everything has been
- [15:26] set up properly. Fantastic. Now, there's
- [15:28] one last piece that we need to work on
- [15:31] together. So, if you just click back to
- [15:34] the root menu, which you can click on
- [15:36] Google Cloud, it'll take you back to the
- [15:37] root. We need to copy over a few pieces
- [15:39] of information over to our bucket. So,
- [15:43] we need to copy two things. One, we need
- [15:45] to copy the project ID. So, you can
- [15:46] click copy. And basically what we're
- [15:48] doing is we are trying to update our
- [15:51] environment to say, "Hey AI agent, where
- [15:54] do you want me to deploy and use all my
- [15:56] project resources?" That's exactly what
- [15:57] we need to set up. So when it comes to
- [15:59] Google Cloud Project, we're going to put
- [16:01] your new project name here. For cloud
- [16:03] location, we're just going to use the
- [16:05] default, which in my case was US Central
- [16:07] 1. I would recommend using this one as
- [16:09] well. Basically, you could use any of
- [16:11] the deployed AI enabled locations.
- [16:14] There's a huge list, I think about 30
- [16:16] different places that enable access to
- [16:18] AI features, but US Central 1 works. So,
- [16:20] I would definitely recommend using this.
- [16:21] The final thing we need to do is say,
- [16:24] hey, where is the bucket that you want
- [16:25] me to deploy resources to? So, what you
- [16:28] can do is go ahead and type in click
- [16:31] cloud storage, which will take you back
- [16:32] to your bucket. You're going to click
- [16:33] buckets. Then, when you click ADK
- [16:35] shortbot or whatever name you gave it,
- [16:37] what you can do is you can find the name
- [16:39] for it right here. So, whatever name
- [16:42] pops up right here, that is the name of
- [16:43] your bucket. So, you can come back over
- [16:45] here, paste it in. Fantastic. You now
- [16:47] have your project set up to where it's
- [16:49] pointing to all of your cloud resources.
- [16:51] And that's everything that you need to
- [16:53] do now that you've enabled all of your
- [16:54] AI resources, set up your bucket, and
- [16:57] you've updated your environment
- [16:58] variables. So, now what we can do is go
- [17:00] ahead and head over to step number four
- [17:02] where we're going to start setting up
- [17:03] Google Cloud CLI to connect your local
- [17:05] computer to all of your cloud resources.
- [17:07] So, let's go ahead and head over to step
- [17:09] number four. So, welcome to step number
- [17:11] four where we're going to set up the
- [17:13] Google Cloud CLI on your local computer.
- [17:16] And this is what's going to allow you to
- [17:17] do two things. One, it's going to allow
- [17:19] you to actually run your local agents
- [17:21] properly because it's going to give you
- [17:23] access to Gemini on your local computer
- [17:26] to where it's going to pull down all the
- [17:27] credentials and give you access to
- [17:28] running it. And two, it's going to give
- [17:30] you the ability to start deploying your
- [17:32] agents to Google Cloud. Now, why are we
- [17:35] doing this? Well, if you actually head
- [17:37] over to the agent development kit quick
- [17:40] start guide, you can see there is a step
- [17:42] to where it's like, all right, cool. In
- [17:44] order to actually start to use these
- [17:46] large language models, which option do
- [17:48] you want to do to access the LLM
- [17:50] service? And in our case, we are using
- [17:52] Vertex AI because that Vertex AI is what
- [17:54] also gives us access to agent engine.
- [17:57] So, this is exactly why we're following
- [17:59] the steps. So, as you can see, it says
- [18:01] to set up Google Cloud CLI. So, what you
- [18:04] can do is click this link or in the
- [18:06] readme docs, I have a link for you to
- [18:08] follow to. So, what you want to do,
- [18:09] click this link and it'll take you to a
- [18:11] website that looks just like this where
- [18:13] it's going to say, okay, here are the
- [18:15] different platforms you can install
- [18:17] Google Cloud CLI on. And in my case, I'm
- [18:20] on a Mac. So, all I needed to do was,
- [18:23] you obviously are going to click
- [18:24] whatever platform you're using, but in
- [18:25] my case, I'm on a Mac and I'm using
- [18:27] Apple Silicon. So, I went ahead and
- [18:29] clicked this and then I downloaded it.
- [18:31] Once I downloaded it, all I needed to do
- [18:34] was run this command that it tells you
- [18:36] to run. And this is going to go ahead
- [18:37] and install it on your local computer.
- [18:40] So, literally just follow these
- [18:41] instructions. And then once it's
- [18:42] installed, all you need to do is run
- [18:44] Google Cloud Unnit. What this is going
- [18:47] to do is allow you to start to run
- [18:50] Google Cloud anywhere on your computer.
- [18:51] So once you run Google Cloud init, it's
- [18:53] going to add it to your path. So you can
- [18:55] at any point anywhere just run Google
- [18:57] Cloud and it'll start to work on your
- [18:59] computer just like this. Great. So I'm
- [19:01] going to run Google Cloud init with you
- [19:03] because we also need to set up and
- [19:04] connect our project to actually point to
- [19:07] the proper project. So when you're first
- [19:09] using it, it's going to ask you to do
- [19:11] two things. It's probably going to ask
- [19:13] you to log in. So let me just show you
- [19:14] that as well. So you're going to run
- [19:16] g-cloud login. And what this will do is
- [19:19] actually ask you to sorry G-Cloud off
- [19:21] login. So what this is going to ask you
- [19:23] to do is go ahead and log in to your
- [19:25] account. So I'm going to log in. And
- [19:26] then once you log in, you're going to
- [19:28] say, "Yes, I want to accept all of these
- [19:30] different permissions." Great. You're
- [19:32] now logged into Google Cloud CLI. And
- [19:34] you can start to run any of the things
- [19:36] that you want to do and actually have
- [19:38] access to Google Cloud. Then what we can
- [19:40] do is run Google Cloud. And this is
- [19:43] where we're going to go ahead and start
- [19:45] setting up our local environment to
- [19:48] start pointing to the proper projects.
- [19:50] So yours is going to not show this
- [19:52] because you're doing this for the first
- [19:53] time. So, you're going to probably just
- [19:55] walk through the like, hey, what project
- [19:57] would you like to set up? In my case,
- [19:59] I'm going to say, hey, I want to
- [20:00] reinitialize this to point to the proper
- [20:02] project. So, I'm gonna say one, I'd like
- [20:04] you to show me all my potential
- [20:06] projects. And I'll point to the right
- [20:07] one. And before I do that, it's going to
- [20:09] ask which account would you like to use
- [20:10] to perform? In my case, you saw me just
- [20:12] log in with my email. So, that's exactly
- [20:14] what I'm going to do. Then, it's going
- [20:15] to show me all of my existing projects.
- [20:18] Now, in my case, we just created this
- [20:20] project. So, number one, so this is the
- [20:22] project I'm going to pick. You obviously
- [20:23] want to pick the project you created in
- [20:25] Google Cloud. Then it's going to say, do
- [20:26] you want to configure a default zone?
- [20:28] We're not going to worry about that for
- [20:29] now. And now you can see, hey, congrats.
- [20:32] You are ready to start using Google
- [20:34] Cloud and it's connected to this
- [20:36] project. So fantastic. You have actually
- [20:38] set up Google Cloud to work locally on
- [20:41] your computer. And what's really cool is
- [20:44] now you also have ability to run that
- [20:46] ADK command I showed originally that ADK
- [20:49] web where it actually spins up the local
- [20:52] agent that we created and runs it. Now
- [20:54] that we have access to Vertex AI and all
- [20:57] of our Gemini keys and everything else
- [20:59] that are just automatically created
- [21:00] under the hood, you can now start to
- [21:01] actually run this as well. So this is
- [21:03] where you can start to come in here,
- [21:05] pick an agent. Let's actually go ahead.
- [21:07] Sorry, I'm running this from the wrong
- [21:08] folder. I was like, why is it showing
- [21:09] all those random files? So sorry. You
- [21:11] can actually run it here. ADK web. And
- [21:13] this is where it'll show all of your
- [21:14] different potential agents that you
- [21:16] have. And this is where you can start to
- [21:18] run it all. So ADK and then hey, how are
- [21:22] you? So just to show that's working. So
- [21:25] it's going to run. It's going to go
- [21:27] trigger it. It's going to original
- [21:28] count, new count. Fantastic. So
- [21:30] everything is looking good. So we now
- [21:32] have our agent up and running. And we
- [21:34] are now at the final step where we're
- [21:36] going to start walking through how we
- [21:37] can start to deploy this agent that
- [21:40] we've created now to Google Cloud now
- [21:42] that we've set up and connected
- [21:43] everything. So let's go ahead and head
- [21:44] to step number five. So welcome to step
- [21:46] number five where we're now going to
- [21:47] dive into deploying your agents over to
- [21:50] agent engine. And before we just start
- [21:51] running through the code where you're
- [21:53] going to see exactly how to deploy these
- [21:54] agents, I want to walk you through a few
- [21:57] core concepts you need to understand
- [21:59] first. So when we're actually looking at
- [22:01] the code in just a second, you
- [22:02] understand, oh yeah, that is what's
- [22:04] happening and I understand why all the
- [22:06] different parts are moving the way they
- [22:07] are. Okay. So let's look at a few of the
- [22:09] most important things first. So what
- [22:12] we've done so far is we have created an
- [22:15] agent and now that agent can run locally
- [22:17] on our computer and what we're trying to
- [22:19] do is two things. One, we want this
- [22:21] agent to get bundled up into a container
- [22:24] and deployed over to Vertex AI engine.
- [22:27] That's exactly what we're trying to do
- [22:29] here. And under the hood, when we dive
- [22:30] in the code, you're going to see that
- [22:31] this is actually super straightforward.
- [22:34] You really will do two things. You are
- [22:36] going to create the engine, and it's
- [22:39] going to be called a reasoning engine
- [22:40] cuz we're basically almost like building
- [22:42] a chat agent is what we've done so far.
- [22:44] And so, we're creating a reasoning
- [22:46] engine. And all we're doing is passing
- [22:48] in our root agent, which is our
- [22:50] shortbot. And what we're doing is
- [22:51] saying, "Hey, enable tracing." And once
- [22:53] you've created your agent and it gets
- [22:56] wrapped and turned into an application,
- [22:58] all we need to do is then deploy it. And
- [23:00] we're going to dive more into the code
- [23:01] in just a second, but what we're going
- [23:03] to do is create a deployment. And how
- [23:05] this works is you say agent engine,
- [23:08] please create a new engine. And all you
- [23:11] do is pass in this application right
- [23:13] here. And it's going to take all of the
- [23:15] different agents, sub agents, tools.
- [23:17] It's going to package it all together
- [23:19] and deploy it over to agent engine. And
- [23:22] you need to specify two other things.
- [23:24] Any requirements. So basically, it's all
- [23:26] getting bundled and packaged together.
- [23:28] So if there's any specific packages your
- [23:30] agents use, like if you're building a
- [23:31] weather application and you needed to
- [23:33] use like a Python weather SDK or
- [23:36] anything like that, you would start
- [23:37] adding all of those additional packages
- [23:39] right here. So weather SDKs, if you were
- [23:42] using some other fancy libraries, you'd
- [23:44] pass them all right here. And then when
- [23:45] it comes to extra packages, what you
- [23:48] want to do is put the name of your
- [23:50] package. So in our case, if you actually
- [23:53] go look at the code that I wrote, you
- [23:55] can see that everything that we're
- [23:57] trying to deploy is in the
- [24:00] ADK_Shortbot package. So that's exactly
- [24:02] what we've done over here where we just
- [24:04] say, "Hey, the only package you need to
- [24:06] deploy is ADK shortbot because this
- [24:08] includes all the agents you need for
- [24:10] deployment." So that's what we're
- [24:12] putting there. So that's the only thing
- [24:13] you need to put in the extra packages.
- [24:15] Okay, check. We've walked through high
- [24:17] level what's happening. Now there's a
- [24:19] few core pieces of terminology you need
- [24:21] to understand before we start deploying
- [24:24] these to the cloud. So so far you've
- [24:26] seen how we can create a deployment and
- [24:29] we run this Python code and it actually
- [24:31] deploys it off to agent engine and what
- [24:33] that's going to do is create a
- [24:34] deployment. A deployment is nothing more
- [24:37] than all the instructions needed to run
- [24:39] the agent. So it's just sitting there
- [24:41] waiting to be used. Then what we can do
- [24:43] is create a session. And a session is
- [24:46] nothing more than saying okay I would
- [24:48] like to use this deployed agent and now
- [24:50] I'm going to start having a conversation
- [24:51] with it. So a session is nothing more
- [24:53] than a conversation with an agent. So
- [24:55] hopefully that makes sense. So let me
- [24:57] show you some examples of this in
- [24:59] action. When we were using our ADK web
- [25:02] earlier in the browser, you saw how we
- [25:05] could chat with our agent. So you can
- [25:07] say we're chatting with this agent. And
- [25:09] every time we create a new conversation,
- [25:10] it's going to add a new session. And if
- [25:12] you remember, a session is nothing more
- [25:13] than messages. So if you actually click
- [25:15] into a session, what you'll notice is it
- [25:18] just shows this. It just shows a summary
- [25:20] of all the messages we pass back and
- [25:22] forth between us and the agent. If we
- [25:24] had more tool calls, it would show the
- [25:25] tool calls in here. And that's pretty
- [25:28] much everything you need to know when it
- [25:29] comes to deploying agents. There's
- [25:31] deployments and there's sessions.
- [25:33] Deployments contain all the instructions
- [25:34] and packages and everything needed to
- [25:36] run the agent and sessions are actual
- [25:38] conversations with messages with that
- [25:40] specific deployed agent. Okay, so
- [25:43] hopefully that makes sense and you kind
- [25:44] of see how the dots connect. And don't
- [25:46] worry, we're going to actually now that
- [25:47] you've seen these highle concepts, we're
- [25:49] going to hop over to the code, deploy
- [25:51] our agent, go ahead and start creating
- [25:52] new sessions. And once we've created a
- [25:54] session, you're going to see us actually
- [25:56] start chatting with the agent back and
- [25:57] forth. So let's go ahead and hop over to
- [25:59] the code where we're going to start
- [26:00] taking action on everything you just
- [26:02] learned. All right, guys. So, welcome to
- [26:03] the code portion of deploying your
- [26:05] agents to agent engine. And before we
- [26:07] dive in to look at the code, I just want
- [26:09] to mention that I've created a script
- [26:10] for you guys to make deployment as easy
- [26:13] as possible. And I've tried to set it up
- [26:15] in a way to where you can just type in
- [26:17] the command line and perform all the
- [26:19] actions that you would like to do.
- [26:21] Specifically, I have set up the code in
- [26:24] a fashion so that you can create and
- [26:27] delete and list all of your deployments
- [26:29] that you've made to agent engine. And
- [26:31] then outside of that, I've also set it
- [26:33] up so that you can look and start to
- [26:37] chat with all the sessions that you
- [26:39] create because you remember sessions are
- [26:41] where we chat to. And then finally, I've
- [26:43] set it up so that you can easily send
- [26:45] messages and start to chat with your
- [26:47] deployed agents in one of these
- [26:49] sessions. So this will make more sense
- [26:50] and we're going to actually walk through
- [26:51] it part by part. So don't worry if any
- [26:53] of this is confusing. We're going to go
- [26:55] step by step and hit each one of these.
- [26:57] Okay, so first things first, what we
- [26:59] need to do is create our own agent and
- [27:02] deploy it to agent engine. This is the
- [27:05] exact same code that you guys saw
- [27:06] earlier where we're going off and first
- [27:09] creating the application and then
- [27:11] deploying the agent application to
- [27:14] Google Cloud App Engine. So here's what
- [27:16] we need to do. If you come down to your
- [27:18] terminal, you can type in poetry run and
- [27:22] then you can type in deploy remote. Now,
- [27:24] let me break down each part of this so
- [27:26] it actually makes sense on why we're
- [27:27] doing each thing. So, poetry, this is
- [27:30] what we're using for our package
- [27:31] management. And what we're doing is
- [27:33] saying, "Hey, I would like you to run
- [27:36] this script." So, where the heck is this
- [27:38] script defined? Great question. If you
- [27:40] head back over to pipro.tl, you can see
- [27:43] that I've created a script for you guys,
- [27:45] which is deploy remote. And deploy
- [27:47] remote calls the deployment python file.
- [27:51] and it calls remote sorry it goes to the
- [27:54] deployment folder calls the remote
- [27:56] Python file and runs the main function.
- [27:58] So that's exactly what we have. So here
- [28:00] is our deployment folder with our remote
- [28:03] Python file and then inside of that we
- [28:06] are trying to run this main function. So
- [28:09] that's exactly what we have here folder
- [28:11] file function. Okay, cool. Hopefully
- [28:13] that makes sense. So now what we're
- [28:14] going to do is we would like to go ahead
- [28:17] and create our deployment of our agent.
- [28:21] So I'm going to run it first just so you
- [28:23] can see how it works. We're not actually
- [28:25] deploying and creating it yet. I just
- [28:27] want to show you that it's going to give
- [28:28] you all the possible options that you
- [28:30] can run to basically use this deploy
- [28:32] script. In our case, we're trying to
- [28:35] create our deployment which is going to
- [28:36] push our local agent to the cloud. So
- [28:39] we're going to run at the very end of
- [28:40] this command d-create. And I'll make it
- [28:43] a little bit bigger for you guys so you
- [28:44] can see too. So now when I run create,
- [28:46] what it's going to do is go, thank you
- [28:48] for giving me everything that I need.
- [28:51] I'm going to install all the proper
- [28:53] dependencies that I need. And then from
- [28:55] there, once I know everything I need to
- [28:57] install, I'm going to use that bucket
- [28:59] that you created earlier and we set up
- [29:02] in our environment variable files. And
- [29:03] I'm going to start saving everything
- [29:06] over to our Google storage bucket. So,
- [29:08] I'm going to save all the instructions
- [29:10] dependencies and I'm going to go ahead
- [29:12] and build this agent and save it in a
- [29:14] zip file over to our bucket. And then
- [29:17] once it's saved everything to the cloud,
- [29:19] things are happy. Then it's going to
- [29:22] kick off agent engine and saying, "Hey,
- [29:24] you here's all the raw ingredients you
- [29:26] need. Now, please go forth and deploy
- [29:29] this agent." And you can actually look
- [29:31] at the progress of this agent in real
- [29:33] time to see where it's at in the
- [29:34] deployment process. Quick heads up, this
- [29:36] can take like up to 10 minutes to deploy
- [29:38] an agent. So, you know, get a cup of
- [29:39] coffee and wait. But let me show you
- [29:41] what's going to happen in real time. So,
- [29:42] if we click on that link, we can look at
- [29:44] the logs, the deployment logs in real
- [29:46] time. So, let me go ahead and make this
- [29:48] full screen for you guys. So, what we
- [29:50] can see is we are in our correct
- [29:52] project. And then you can see in real
- [29:54] time it is going through the entire
- [29:57] deployment process. So, you can see, let
- [29:59] me zoom out. Oops. Sorry. It doesn't
- [30:01] like being in this like half state. So
- [30:03] you can see in real time what it's doing
- [30:05] is it is going okay cool all those
- [30:08] packages you put in listed in our Google
- [30:10] storage bucket. I'm going to go ahead
- [30:12] and download everything in the bucket
- [30:14] that you told me to download. And I can
- [30:16] actually show this to you in real time.
- [30:18] So if we hop back over over here and we
- [30:20] go to our cloud storage bucket, you can
- [30:22] see that our new everything that we
- [30:25] talked about is actually deployed. So
- [30:26] you can see in our agent engine folder,
- [30:28] you can now see it has all of our
- [30:30] requirements. So you can see if I was to
- [30:33] actually look at this. So we'll go ahead
- [30:34] and look at it just so you can see it.
- [30:35] So you can see it has all of the proper
- [30:37] dependencies needed to actually run this
- [30:39] agent. And then what it's doing is it's
- [30:41] downloading everything and those
- [30:43] requirements file. And from there what
- [30:44] it's doing is it's installing all the
- [30:46] dependencies in real time. And what it's
- [30:48] trying to do is fully download create
- [30:51] the container and get it ready to be
- [30:53] fully deployed on agent engine. So, what
- [30:55] I'm going to do is do a quick pause and
- [30:56] we're going to come back once the agent
- [30:58] is fully deployed because like I said,
- [30:59] it can take up to 10 minutes. And I'll
- [31:01] show you that it's running once it's
- [31:02] done deploying. All right, guys. So, it
- [31:04] just deployed our agent to agent engine,
- [31:07] and we can confirm that it properly
- [31:08] deployed it by running the list
- [31:10] deployments command. So, you can see we
- [31:13] have an extra function in here that's
- [31:15] going to say, "All right, agent engine,
- [31:16] please list out all the deployments so I
- [31:18] can see what's actually been deployed to
- [31:20] the cloud." So to run this, all we need
- [31:22] to do is go back and see what available
- [31:25] commands we have to us. And in our case,
- [31:27] we want to run the list command. So come
- [31:30] back up here, type in list. And now we
- [31:32] should see that we have a deployed agent
- [31:34] on agent engine. Fantastic. This is the
- [31:37] exact agent we wanted to deploy. Now we
- [31:39] can move forth with creating a new
- [31:42] session. And a session is nothing more
- [31:44] than a conversation between us and our
- [31:47] deployed agent. And the important
- [31:49] variables that you need to pass in when
- [31:51] creating a session are the resource ID.
- [31:54] So this is like hey what deployed agent
- [31:56] should I talk to. Also which user is
- [31:59] talking with the agent. This doesn't
- [32:01] need to exist anywhere else. Like this
- [32:03] you know usually would just come from
- [32:04] your application. And the reason agent
- [32:06] engine put this in here is so that at
- [32:08] any point you could go up and look to
- [32:10] figure out all the different
- [32:12] conversations a specific user has had
- [32:14] with a specific agent. So that's why
- [32:16] they put it here. It's really just to
- [32:17] help you list out sessions later on. So,
- [32:20] let us go ahead and try it out. So,
- [32:23] we're going to copy the resource ID
- [32:25] because that's what we needed. And in
- [32:26] this time, what we're going to do is run
- [32:28] the create session command. This is what
- [32:30] we're running this time. So, we're going
- [32:32] to type in create session. Create
- [32:35] session. And then pass in the resource
- [32:38] ID. And if you don't pass in a user ID
- [32:42] specifically, it just uses test user by
- [32:44] default. So, that's totally fine with
- [32:45] me. So, we're going to go ahead and
- [32:47] create our session. And this will take a
- [32:49] few seconds and showcase the new session
- [32:51] results. So, tada. You can now see I
- [32:54] just created your session for you.
- [32:56] Here's the new session ID. Here's the
- [32:58] user ID, in our case, test user, and
- [33:00] everything else you need to know about
- [33:01] the new session with our agent. Great.
- [33:04] So, now that we have that set up, what
- [33:06] we can do is fetch that specific session
- [33:08] just to show that it was created
- [33:10] properly. So, what we can do, you can
- [33:12] see we have a get session flag. We'll
- [33:14] actually skip it and we're just going to
- [33:15] go ahead and chat with the session. But
- [33:16] just know you could list out all your
- [33:18] sessions for our specific user and you
- [33:20] could grab a specific session to see all
- [33:22] the message history. But in our case,
- [33:24] let's go ahead and have fun and send the
- [33:26] specific message. So going back to
- [33:28] earlier, we need to call the send flag.
- [33:31] So in our case, send is the new command
- [33:34] we're trying to run. So we're going to
- [33:36] type in send. And now we can look up
- [33:38] what information do we need to provide.
- [33:40] Well, resource ID, we have that. What
- [33:42] else do we need to provide? We need to
- [33:44] provide the user ID. In our case, this
- [33:47] was just test user. And then finally, we
- [33:50] need to pass in the session ID. So
- [33:52] session ID, you can grab that right
- [33:55] here. And then what we need to do is
- [33:57] pass in the actual message itself. So
- [34:00] you can see message right here. So d-
- [34:02] message. And now we can just say like,
- [34:05] hey, how did your weekend go? Anything
- [34:10] fun? And then we can send this off to
- [34:13] our agent. And what we should see back
- [34:15] in just a few seconds is our agent
- [34:18] responding back to us. So you can say,
- [34:20] "We sent this message. How'd your
- [34:21] weekend go?" And then we got back this
- [34:23] response. So the original character
- [34:25] count was 38. I shortened it to 23 just
- [34:28] by saying, "Hey, how was your weekend?"
- [34:29] So all around it did a good job of
- [34:31] shortening the entire thing. So all
- [34:33] around super impressed. And that is us
- [34:35] actually communicating with our deployed
- [34:37] agent. This isn't local. This is a
- [34:39] deployed agent running in the cloud to
- [34:41] where it's running, doing its thing. So
- [34:43] all around, I thought this is amazing.
- [34:45] Now, let me go ahead and we're going to
- [34:46] hop over next just as a bonus session. I
- [34:48] want to show you how you can start to
- [34:50] look at traces and logs of these
- [34:52] deployed agents. Let's go ahead and look
- [34:53] at that real quick. Okay, so as a bonus,
- [34:55] I wanted to show you guys how you could
- [34:57] look at traces for your deployed agents.
- [34:59] And a trace is nothing more than a
- [35:01] specific set of messages that have been
- [35:02] passed back and forth. It's how you can
- [35:04] actually see what's going on between
- [35:06] your agent and your users. So, all you
- [35:08] need to do back inside Google Cloud,
- [35:10] what you can do is type in traces, and
- [35:13] you'll should see something called trace
- [35:14] explore. That's exactly what we want to
- [35:16] click. Once you click trace explore, you
- [35:18] can start to see all the different
- [35:20] messages that have been sent between you
- [35:22] and your customers. So, you can see we
- [35:24] have an invocation which goes ahead and
- [35:27] if you click on it, you can see how it
- [35:29] says, "All right, this trace shows that
- [35:31] agent, specifically the ADK shortbot was
- [35:34] called." Then you can see, well, what
- [35:36] did that agent do? Well, it called an
- [35:38] LLM. Then you can dive in here to see
- [35:40] everything that happened. So, you can
- [35:42] see we called Gemini Flash 2.0. You can
- [35:45] see that we gave an instruction saying
- [35:47] like, "Hey, your message is shortening
- [35:49] assistant. Here's what you should do."
- [35:50] You can see the response from the LLM.
- [35:52] So, you can actually see everything that
- [35:54] happens inside of your agents going
- [35:56] through traces. So, this is a really
- [35:57] cool way to like look back and see like,
- [35:59] hey, what has been happening inside of
- [36:01] my agent? Is it been performing
- [36:03] properly? You can, you know, if you
- [36:04] wanted to, you could do some filters
- [36:06] here to say like, hey, I only want to
- [36:08] look at LLM calls that have happened and
- [36:11] see, well, what are the LLM calls that
- [36:13] happen? So, you can actually dig in and
- [36:14] see everything here. I thought traces
- [36:16] was a super cool functionality and
- [36:17] definitely wanted to show it to you guys
- [36:19] cuz now you're an expert at deploying
- [36:20] agents to agent engine and this is a
- [36:23] next step that you could look in to see
- [36:25] how your agents are performing. And just
