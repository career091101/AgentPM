- [00:00] So, we've gotten pretty comfortable at
- [00:01] delegating tasks to our AI coding agents
- [00:04] like Cloud Code and our terminal or an
- [00:07] IDE like Cursor. But what about when
- [00:09] you're away from your desk or if you
- [00:12] want to kick off a big complex build
- [00:14] before you leave for the day and you
- [00:16] just want to come back in the morning
- [00:17] and find it done? That's where
- [00:19] cloud-based background agents come in.
- [00:21] And right now, we've got three major
- [00:23] players who are offering pretty good
- [00:25] options for running coding agents in the
- [00:27] cloud. We've got Claude Code on the web.
- [00:30] We've got Cursor's background agents.
- [00:33] And we have OpenAI's codecs on the web.
- [00:35] Now, on the surface, all three of these
- [00:37] tools are pretty similar. They all spin
- [00:39] up a cloud environment. They connect to
- [00:41] your GitHub repository and then they
- [00:43] create their own branch and eventually
- [00:45] they'll submit a pull request. So, the
- [00:47] basic mechanics are the same. But where
- [00:49] they differ, and this is what actually
- [00:51] matters, is the workflow. So, how do you
- [00:53] actually initiate a new task with a
- [00:55] cloud agent? How do you monitor its
- [00:58] progress? How do you check it out on
- [00:59] your mobile device? Or how do you wrap
- [01:01] things up when it's done? The interface
- [01:03] and the workflow varies quite a bit
- [01:06] between cloud code on the web, cursor
- [01:08] background agents, and codecs on the
- [01:10] web. So, in this video, I'm not just
- [01:12] comparing whether they can complete a
- [01:14] feature in the background. That's table
- [01:16] stakes. I want to show you what it
- [01:18] actually feels like to use each one of
- [01:21] these tools day-to-day because that
- [01:23] workflow experience, that's what
- [01:24] determines whether you'll actually reach
- [01:26] for one of these cloud background agent
- [01:29] tools or just stick with your local
- [01:31] setup. Now, if you're serious about
- [01:33] staying ahead of the curve when it comes
- [01:34] to building with AI, and I mean actually
- [01:37] building, not just following the hype,
- [01:39] then I want you to read my builder
- [01:40] briefing. That's a 5-minute read that I
- [01:42] send every Friday. No fluff, just
- [01:44] practical notes on what's working right
- [01:46] now in AI first development. You can get
- [01:49] yours by going to buildermethods.com and
- [01:51] subscribers are always the first to know
- [01:53] about my next live workshop where we
- [01:55] talk about what's working right now when
- [01:57] building with AI. All right, so to give
- [01:59] these three different uh cloud agent
- [02:02] systems uh a really good go at it, I
- [02:04] want to make an update to my builder
- [02:06] methods uh application and my website uh
- [02:09] specifically on the workshops area. So,
- [02:11] I run these live workshops on building
- [02:13] with AI. I do these about once a month.
- [02:15] And currently, it's just a really simple
- [02:17] index view which just has a list of the
- [02:21] workshops. Sometimes they're upcoming in
- [02:23] the future, sometimes they're in the
- [02:24] past. Uh, and then it links to the uh
- [02:27] the page where, you know, you can either
- [02:28] purchase a ticket or if you're a Builder
- [02:30] Methods Pro member, then uh you get
- [02:32] complimentary access to all past and
- [02:35] future workshops. Uh, but I want to
- [02:37] improve this layout. I want to give them
- [02:39] nice thumbnails here. I want to be able
- [02:40] to filter by which workshops are
- [02:43] upcoming in the future and which ones
- [02:45] are in the past and just have recordings
- [02:47] available. Um, and I've also designed
- [02:49] some new thumbnails that I want to, you
- [02:52] know, display on each of these
- [02:53] workshops, you know, kind of like that
- [02:55] one. Um, and the nice thing is that I've
- [02:57] already designed a section of the site
- [02:58] that has this layout that I'm going for.
- [03:01] So this is our video library uh which
- [03:04] has you know a bunch of videos and um
- [03:06] it's a grid layout or you can toggle to
- [03:09] a list layout like that and the system
- [03:12] will remember your layout and then you
- [03:14] can also filter by topics and here in
- [03:17] this case uh the person viewing is not a
- [03:21] logged in builder methods pro member so
- [03:23] we show this call out that points to
- [03:25] that um but if I do log in and then I go
- [03:28] to library you know we have the same
- [03:30] grid layout here with the list view. Uh,
- [03:33] but instead of the call out, now we have
- [03:34] some filters. So, I can see like which
- [03:37] videos I have recently viewed and I can
- [03:39] see which videos I'm adding to my list
- [03:42] and so on. So, I want to actually reuse
- [03:44] this same layout, the grid and the list
- [03:47] view toggle. And I also want to
- [03:49] establish a topics filter for workshops.
- [03:52] And then I also want to have a filter so
- [03:54] that users can easily see which
- [03:56] workshops are coming in the future and
- [03:58] which ones are uh in the past. So to do
- [04:00] this uh we're going to run this in cloud
- [04:02] code on the web. We're also going to run
- [04:05] a background agent in cursor and I'm
- [04:08] going to use codeex uh on the web. And
- [04:10] I'm going to sort of compare all three
- [04:12] of these and I'll give you my
- [04:13] impressions uh all the way through this
- [04:15] process. Um so before I start to kick it
- [04:18] off, I want to show you the prompt that
- [04:20] I'm going to be using. And as you can
- [04:21] see, it's a pretty long one. Um and it
- [04:23] includes most of what I just described.
- [04:25] And this is what I typically do. I will
- [04:27] draft a prompt in detail. I'm giving it
- [04:30] very specific instruction on which files
- [04:33] and patterns and interfaces and
- [04:35] components that I I've already
- [04:37] established in this interface for
- [04:39] browsing the library. So hopefully the
- [04:41] agents will reuse a lot of that code and
- [04:45] and that interface. Okay, so let's kick
- [04:47] this off. I'm going to start with cloud
- [04:49] code on the web. And what I like about
- [04:50] it off the bat is that this this seems
- [04:52] to be like the closest to the cloud code
- [04:57] CLI experience. It's it it really feels
- [04:59] like uh just a web version of the same
- [05:02] experience. It's very consistent. Okay,
- [05:04] so now first thing you will need to
- [05:06] connect your GitHub repository for your
- [05:08] project and I've already done that for
- [05:09] my builder methods project. Also in
- [05:11] cloud code you can select which model.
- [05:13] Uh, for smaller things, I would probably
- [05:15] go with Haiku, but uh, for this is a
- [05:17] somewhat larger piece, so I'm going to,
- [05:19] um, use the Sonnet 4.5 model. That's
- [05:21] sort of my go-to these days uh, on most
- [05:24] things. I use that and cursors composer
- [05:26] model, which we'll I'll show you in just
- [05:28] a minute. So, I'm going to take my long
- [05:29] prompt and I'm just going to drop it
- [05:31] right in here. And we're going to kick
- [05:32] this off.
- [05:35] Okay, so Claude is getting to work and I
- [05:37] can already see it's updating live on my
- [05:40] iPhone through the uh, Claude mobile
- [05:42] app. Um, so that's nice and and it all
- [05:44] looks really consistent between the two.
- [05:46] It actually seems to be happening in
- [05:48] sync. So I could I could see like if I
- [05:50] ever out or traveling or something and I
- [05:52] want to kick off a new task, like it's
- [05:53] it's all right here. So that's really
- [05:55] cool. Um, so that's working. Now, let's
- [05:57] go ahead and get a cursor agent up and
- [05:59] running. So this one I'm really
- [06:01] interested in using because I use cursor
- [06:03] every day as my IDE. So uh, here I am in
- [06:07] the web interface. Now, Cursor, as far
- [06:09] as I know, I don't believe they have an
- [06:10] actual mobile app the way that Claude
- [06:13] does and ChatgBT does uh with with
- [06:16] Codeex. Um, but cursor.com, I find
- [06:19] actually is totally usable on the mobile
- [06:22] web. It's totally responsive. It's
- [06:24] actually a really good interface. Um, so
- [06:26] I've been pretty happy with it in both
- [06:28] cases. So, I'm going to go ahead and So,
- [06:30] I'm here in the web interface. I'm going
- [06:32] to, you know, I've already started up a
- [06:34] new agent here. Once again, I you know,
- [06:36] you also need to connect your GitHub
- [06:38] repository, which I've already done here
- [06:40] for builder methods. It's the same repo
- [06:42] that I'm working in. This indicates that
- [06:44] we're going to be branching off of the
- [06:46] main branch. Uh I think there was a
- [06:48] similar
- [06:50] You know what? I'm not sure if cloud
- [06:52] code even had that selection. There
- [06:54] might be a setting for it somewhere, but
- [06:56] yeah. So, this is specifying that I am
- [06:58] branching off of main. And then we can
- [07:00] select the model. So, I am going to use
- [07:02] Cursor's Composer 1 model, which is
- [07:04] their new model. I did an entire video
- [07:06] here on the channel last week covering
- [07:09] uh Cursor 2.0 and the new Composer
- [07:12] model, which I'm super impressed with.
- [07:14] It's incredibly fast, and it's also
- [07:16] really accurate, and I find it's almost
- [07:19] as good as set 4.5 in most cases. The
- [07:22] other cool thing about Cursor 2.0, you
- [07:24] know, and you can do this through their
- [07:25] their web background agents is you can
- [07:27] actually run multiple uh different
- [07:30] agents and even run multiple instances
- [07:32] of them, you know, multiply them. We're
- [07:34] not going to do that here. Uh I've used
- [07:37] enough token usage uh in my cursor
- [07:39] account this month, but um I'm going to
- [07:41] stick with curs uh composer one and I'm
- [07:43] going to give it that prompt. And I bet
- [07:44] that even though I'm starting this way
- [07:47] later than the cloud code agent, I bet
- [07:49] this is going to finish even faster
- [07:50] because composer is just lightning fast.
- [07:53] Okay, so composer model using cursor is
- [07:57] off and running. And I can see that here
- [07:59] in the web interface and I'm going to
- [08:02] check it out on mobile by going to
- [08:05] cursor.com.
- [08:08] And there it is. It's already there. Uh
- [08:10] I'll show this on screen. You know, it's
- [08:11] got a it's got a pretty nice mobile
- [08:13] interface that I can easily use using,
- [08:15] you know, like mobile Safari or mobile
- [08:17] Chrome or something like that. Now, what
- [08:19] I'm also interested to see is how does
- [08:21] this work? If I click open in cursor
- [08:24] because I am a cursor user. Cursor is my
- [08:26] IDE. So if I am sitting here in the
- [08:28] office, I'm going to click open in
- [08:30] cursor. And here it is. It's actually
- [08:32] showing me the cloud agent here in the
- [08:35] uh in cursor agent. And I can see down
- [08:38] here it indicates uh this little icon
- [08:40] means that I'm looking at the cloud
- [08:41] agent, not a local agent. And if I go
- [08:44] into my agents list in in agents view
- [08:47] again, I'm seeing that agent here in the
- [08:48] middle and I'm also seeing that agent in
- [08:52] this uh in progress section here in in
- [08:55] cursor. So I really do like that that
- [08:57] integration. I can jump, you know,
- [08:59] straight from the web interface right
- [09:01] into cursor which is right here on my
- [09:03] computer and I can see it all happening
- [09:05] right there. So that's really nice.
- [09:06] Okay, let's go over to codecs. You know,
- [09:08] this is linked right off of my chat GPT
- [09:10] account. Um, once again, you do need to
- [09:13] connect your GitHub repository, but I
- [09:16] found that Codeex sort of tripped me up
- [09:18] a little bit because in addition to
- [09:19] connecting your repo, you also need to
- [09:21] connect what they call an environment.
- [09:23] And all three of these are technically
- [09:25] creating a cloud environment where it's
- [09:28] running your application in the cloud on
- [09:30] their servers, not on your local
- [09:32] machine. Right? Codeex is a little bit
- [09:34] more more explicit about that. And this
- [09:36] is this is what tripped me up because
- [09:37] you can connect I think multiple
- [09:40] repositories into a single environment
- [09:42] and I had accidentally connected my
- [09:44] builder methods repo to a different
- [09:46] environment that I had been working on a
- [09:48] few months ago and that sort of tripped
- [09:50] it up. So I had to both create a repo
- [09:53] like connect my repo and create the
- [09:56] environment in codec. So I did that.
- [09:58] Something to be aware of if if it might
- [10:00] trip you up. So in codeex I can also run
- [10:04] they call them versions. This is like
- [10:06] running multiple agents. So, that's kind
- [10:08] of cool. You can try out different takes
- [10:10] on the same build, similar to what you
- [10:11] can do with cursor. Right now, it is
- [10:13] giving me the option on which branch I
- [10:15] want to branch off of cuz all three of
- [10:17] these are going to create a new branch.
- [10:19] The question is where are we branching
- [10:20] off of? I'm going to branch off of the
- [10:22] main branch. That's fine. One thing that
- [10:23] I'm not seeing, maybe I'm missing it
- [10:26] somewhere, but I can't actually select
- [10:28] the model. I'm assuming that this is
- [10:31] going to be GPT5 and it might be or it
- [10:34] probably is their GPT5 codeex flavored
- [10:37] model. Um, and that's, you know, what is
- [10:40] typically used with, uh, codeex CLI. And
- [10:43] I have a separate video doing a deep
- [10:45] dive on that as well. So, I don't see
- [10:47] the model selector. That's a little bit
- [10:48] strange to me. But anyway, I'm going to
- [10:50] go ahead and uh, copy my prompt into
- [10:53] here. And let's kick this off as well.
- [10:59] So I see my task here at the top of my
- [11:01] list and I can click into it and I can
- [11:03] see uh it is spinning up uh the
- [11:06] environment. This is sort of like you
- [11:07] know a look at at the terminal there.
- [11:10] Let's see if I click view log now. We're
- [11:12] going to sort of like zero in. I think
- [11:14] it's just spinning it up right now. So
- [11:15] it's just getting started. We're going
- [11:16] to check in on the progress as it goes
- [11:18] along. But I'm also going to open up my
- [11:20] chat GPT mobile app and I'm going to go
- [11:23] to codeex. And I do see it right here.
- [11:26] So here here it is at the top and I can
- [11:28] I can see the progress. So all three of
- [11:30] these are working although composer is
- [11:33] already done as and I'm not surprised by
- [11:35] that and we're going to review all of
- [11:37] its work here in just a minute but let's
- [11:38] wait for all three of them to be
- [11:39] finished. It looks like sonnet 4.5 with
- [11:42] cloud code on the web. It's about
- [11:44] halfway through its uh its to-dos. So uh
- [11:48] so yeah I'm going to I'm going to pause
- [11:50] here and I'm going to come right back
- [11:51] when all three agents are done and then
- [11:53] we'll take it from there. Okay. So, it
- [11:55] looks like all three agents are now
- [11:57] complete. Let's take a look at cloud
- [11:59] code first. And so, we can see that all
- [12:01] of the to-dos are finished, and it gave
- [12:03] me the the typical summary for a cloud
- [12:06] code task. And it's all set here in
- [12:08] cursor with uh with composer. So, here's
- [12:11] the finished work there. And then over
- [12:13] in codeex, uh here is the summary here.
- [12:16] I can see that it worked for 11 minutes.
- [12:18] Um so, cloud code probably took about 12
- [12:21] 13 minutes. Uh I guess codeex took about
- [12:24] 11 minutes and composer I don't have a
- [12:26] time on this but it was done in like 2
- [12:28] minutes something like that. Now let me
- [12:30] just compare what the experience is
- [12:33] after the agent has finished their works
- [12:35] and kind of reviewing the work there.
- [12:37] There are a few slight differences
- [12:39] between the three tools here. So with
- [12:41] cloud code I see here that this is the
- [12:44] branch and I just copied that to the
- [12:46] clipboard and that's really nice because
- [12:48] I can just you know pull that down and
- [12:50] and check it out. And I'm going to do
- [12:52] that here in just a second. Um, it does
- [12:54] have a link here to create a PR, but
- [12:57] Claude Code doesn't automatically create
- [12:59] a PR, which is a little bit weird. I I
- [13:01] kind of wish it would just create it. I
- [13:03] don't know why it doesn't. But one of
- [13:04] the really cool things of Cloud Code on
- [13:06] the web is this button. I can click open
- [13:09] in CLI, and I'm going to click that and
- [13:11] then it's going to copy a command to my
- [13:13] clipboard. So then I can go into I'm
- [13:17] going to go into editor mode in cursor.
- [13:19] And instead of just running claude, I'm
- [13:22] going to paste that in. So here I am
- [13:24] going to run claude, but it's going to
- [13:26] add this flag for teleport and then this
- [13:29] session ID. So I'm going to run that.
- [13:31] And so that is going to start up cloud
- [13:34] code and it's going to pull in the
- [13:37] entire session. All of the agents work.
- [13:40] All the history here is automatically
- [13:43] pulled in, which is really pretty cool.
- [13:46] And then the other thing that I noticed
- [13:47] is that in addition to that, it also
- [13:50] automatically opened or pulled this
- [13:54] branch and checked it out. So the thing
- [13:56] with background agents or really any
- [13:58] agents for that matter is of course we
- [14:00] can review their code. Of course we can
- [14:01] do a pull request and and do a code
- [14:03] review there. But what's always most
- [14:05] important to me is to actually run the
- [14:07] server and check it out in the browser
- [14:08] and check out the user experience of the
- [14:11] product that I'm building. Right? So
- [14:13] here I have it checked out. We're going
- [14:14] to check the work that Cloud Code did uh
- [14:16] in the browser. I'm going to run the
- [14:18] server and I bet there's going to be
- [14:21] some uh migrations that are pending.
- [14:23] Yeah. So, we're going to need to run
- [14:25] those. Okay. So, uh I'm here on my local
- [14:29] machine now and I'm going to go down to
- [14:30] resources. I'm going to go to workshops
- [14:33] and all right. So, here is the uh the
- [14:35] workshops index view. Now, I have not
- [14:38] uploaded my thumbnail images yet. So it
- [14:40] looks like these are like temporary
- [14:41] placeholders when there's not a
- [14:43] thumbnail for the workshop. So that's
- [14:44] pretty good. This is exactly according
- [14:46] to my prompt that I gave it. So this is
- [14:48] really looking good so far. Um I can
- [14:52] toggle between the list view and the and
- [14:54] the grid view and it should remember my
- [14:57] preference there when I refresh the page
- [14:59] and it does. So that's pretty cool. And
- [15:01] then I have this toggle switch. Now, I
- [15:03] actually already have a toggle switch
- [15:06] component, and this looks a little bit
- [15:08] off from that. Functionally, it works,
- [15:10] but it didn't actually use the right
- [15:12] toggle switch. All right, so topics.
- [15:14] Now, I don't I haven't actually created
- [15:15] any workshop topics yet. So, let's go
- [15:18] ahead and check out the admin interface.
- [15:20] This is the workshops area. Okay, so
- [15:22] I've created some uh workshop topics or
- [15:25] workshop tags. And then I can go into
- [15:29] each workshop now. And nice, I can I
- [15:32] have my topic and tag interface here.
- [15:35] So, this interface is a little bit
- [15:37] buggy, but again, it's just for me to
- [15:39] use. Um, and it functionally works. So,
- [15:41] that's that's good enough for me. Okay.
- [15:43] So, now I have some topics in the
- [15:44] system, and I can filter them like that.
- [15:47] Okay, we've got a little error here that
- [15:50] I'll need to get worked out and I can
- [15:52] fix that later. I I just want to move on
- [15:54] with the video here and compare uh the
- [15:56] other two agents work here. So overall,
- [15:58] I'm actually pretty happy with the work
- [16:00] that Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5 did
- [16:02] here. I do have some cleanup, some
- [16:04] errors to fix. Oh, one more thing I
- [16:06] wanted to check actually, and that is
- [16:08] the workshops view when I'm logged out.
- [16:11] And good, it shows this call to action
- [16:13] for builder methods pro. Uh because you
- [16:16] know, if you're a pro member, you get
- [16:19] complimentary access to all the
- [16:20] workshops, whereas if you're not, then
- [16:22] you can, you know, like purchase a
- [16:24] ticket to any individual workshop. So
- [16:26] that's why I wanted to have this uh call
- [16:28] out here. Okay. So let me uh sort of
- [16:30] backtrack and we're going to shift over
- [16:32] to the work that cursor did the cursor
- [16:35] background agent with the composer one
- [16:37] model. So in order to do this since
- [16:40] there was a a database migration uh and
- [16:43] I need to get the database back to its
- [16:45] previous state. Rails DB roll back. This
- [16:49] is just a Ruby on Rails thing here of
- [16:51] course. And now I'm going to go back to
- [16:52] main and we should be back to our
- [16:56] original state. And yeah, we are. So
- [16:59] this is how we started off before the
- [17:01] the agents did any of their work. This
- [17:03] is sort of like the boring [laughter] uh
- [17:05] index view for workshops. So now let's
- [17:08] go to cursor. I'm looking at the cursor
- [17:10] web interface here. Now cursor unlike
- [17:15] cloud code and unlike codeex it does
- [17:18] automatically immediately create a PR
- [17:21] and I can just click this button and
- [17:23] that's going to open up the pull request
- [17:25] in GitHub and I can view it here. This
- [17:27] comment it looks like it's from me but
- [17:29] it was actually written by the agent
- [17:31] before I merge it in. Um even if I
- [17:33] review the code I always want to check
- [17:35] it in the browser. And by the way, also
- [17:37] in cursor itself, I can open this agent
- [17:40] and it shows me all the history here.
- [17:42] Looks like it's a little bit different
- [17:43] if I go between editor mode and agents
- [17:46] agents mode. So when I'm in agents mode,
- [17:49] I can actually see
- [17:52] um the I don't know what this review
- [17:55] button does. Let's see. Okay, so that
- [17:57] that basically just opens up all of the
- [17:59] um all the files that were changed. Uh,
- [18:02] but this one is also a link to the PR
- [18:05] and I can check out the branch. You
- [18:07] know, you can use cursors interface for
- [18:09] checking out the branch, but actually
- [18:11] I'm going to use my own alias for doing
- [18:14] this. So, I'm just going to grab this
- [18:16] branch name. And I have an alias that
- [18:18] fetches a branch off of GitHub and then
- [18:21] checks it out and switches to that
- [18:23] branch automatically. I guess that
- [18:24] cursor, you know, their interface here
- [18:26] would would probably do the same, but
- [18:28] it's just part of my muscle memory and
- [18:31] my and it's like a workflow that I that
- [18:33] I trust that always works uh the way
- [18:35] that I want it to work. And I think
- [18:36] that's just really important in general
- [18:38] when we're when we're tweaking and we're
- [18:40] trying out new tools in our workflow.
- [18:41] So, I'm going to go ahead and do my
- [18:44] alias for this and I'm going to paste
- [18:45] that branch name in here. And so, okay.
- [18:48] So, now I've just checked it out. We're
- [18:50] good to go. I'm going to run this
- [18:51] server. And again, we're probably going
- [18:53] to run into those uh migrations. But
- [18:56] just to make sure, let's see how
- [18:59] composer one did from cursor. Here we
- [19:02] are. All right. It looks looks pretty
- [19:04] good. So, here are our four um workshops
- [19:08] and it has my toggle UI all all set up.
- [19:12] Uh you know, the nice thing is that I've
- [19:13] already designed this same UI before, so
- [19:15] it just reused a lot of the same logic.
- [19:17] So, it it did that really well. Here is
- [19:19] the toggle switch. And that one actually
- [19:21] works a lot better than the one that
- [19:23] Claude Code created. So that's that's
- [19:25] interesting. I'll go back to workshops
- [19:26] and I will apply some tags.
- [19:29] Interestingly, uh this interface works
- [19:32] much better than the one that Claude
- [19:33] Code did. So that's another it's another
- [19:35] data point that makes me think I I might
- [19:38] keep the composer work instead of the
- [19:40] claude code work on this one. Um so
- [19:42] that's looking good. Uh but overall I'm
- [19:44] actually very happy with the work that
- [19:46] the composer model from cursor did. And
- [19:49] it did it so much faster than than the
- [19:51] other two did. Okay. But for now, let's
- [19:54] let's backtrack again and let's check
- [19:55] out the work from Codeex and GPT5 from
- [19:59] OpenAI. So we're going to do the same
- [20:01] thing again. We're going to Okay, so
- [20:02] let's go over to Codeex. Again, Codeex
- [20:06] does not automatically create a pull
- [20:08] request in GitHub. Uh, in order to do
- [20:10] that, you'll need to click this button,
- [20:12] create PR, and then we can click view
- [20:15] PR. All right, so now I'm just going to
- [20:16] do the same thing. I'm going to grab the
- [20:18] branch name that Codeex had created in
- [20:20] my system, and I'm going to fetch that
- [20:22] and switch to it. I'm going to run my
- [20:24] server. I'm guessing once again, we're
- [20:27] going to have some pending migrations.
- [20:29] We're going to run those, and let's
- [20:31] check out the workshops index view. And,
- [20:34] uh, yeah, this one has a little issue
- [20:36] here. So let's go ahead and have let's
- [20:39] at least get this working, right? Let's
- [20:41] see if composer can uh can fix this
- [20:43] issue. So now we have the composer model
- [20:46] fixing the work of GPT5 with with
- [20:48] codecs. Okay, all fixed up. Okay, so uh
- [20:51] this one looks pretty good as well.
- [20:53] We've got our uh list mode and the grid
- [20:57] mode. This one has the thumbnail. This
- [20:59] one is coming up in the future and the
- [21:01] rest of these are in the past. I would
- [21:03] want to actually look into this time
- [21:05] zone issue here. And then we've got the
- [21:07] upcoming toggle switch, which seems to
- [21:10] be working just fine. So, that's good.
- [21:12] Let's go ahead and check this out. And
- [21:14] this one works just fine. Cool. All
- [21:17] right. Let's uh look at this in another
- [21:20] browser. And it got the uh the call to
- [21:22] action to join Builder Methods Pro.
- [21:24] That's all looking good. And uh here is
- [21:27] the link that points to the the page to
- [21:30] get a ticket. Good. All right. So I
- [21:31] would say like overall I was most
- [21:33] impressed with the cursor uh both the
- [21:36] cursor experience with with running uh
- [21:38] background agents but also uh the work
- [21:40] that the composer model did. They were
- [21:42] all very similar. They all mostly
- [21:44] finished the the feature pretty well.
- [21:46] I'm a bit surprised that Claude Code and
- [21:49] Sonnet 4.5 uh didn't quite hit the mark
- [21:52] on this one even though that's typically
- [21:54] the the best performer of the three. Um
- [21:56] but you know it really is different from
- [21:58] from one feature to the next. It's kind
- [22:00] of an interesting time. So, I hope you
- [22:02] found this comparison helpful as you
- [22:03] look at different tools for running
- [22:05] cloud coding agents. Uh, as you saw in
- [22:08] the video, I kind of like cloud code
- [22:10] since I use that quite a bit. Cloud code
- [22:12] on the web is pretty impressive. But in
- [22:14] my experience right now, I'm sort of
- [22:16] leaning toward the cursor background
- [22:18] agent workflow, especially since I use
- [22:20] cursor every day as my daily driver, as
- [22:24] my IDE. Now, if you haven't seen it yet,
- [22:26] cursor 2.0 0 recently dropped along with
- [22:29] the composer model which I demoed in
- [22:32] this video. I did a deep dive into
- [22:33] cursor 2.0 and the composer model
- [22:36] specifically the two features that have
- [22:38] actually completely changed how I work
- [22:40] day-to-day. So right after you hit
- [22:43] subscribe on this channel I'll see you
- [22:45] over there next. Let's keep building.
