- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] I am super excited to announce a new
- [00:07] Udemy course that is complete AI
- [00:11] automation and agentic AI boot camp with
- [00:14] no code tool that is NEN. Now this was
- [00:17] one of the most requested course by many
- [00:20] many people from freshers to experienced
- [00:23] professionals to from people from coding
- [00:25] background non-coding background geni
- [00:28] leaders many people were actually
- [00:30] requesting this specific course and we
- [00:32] took somewhere around one and a half
- [00:34] months to probably do the entire
- [00:36] research uh record the entire videos and
- [00:39] build some amazing end to-end projects
- [00:41] and this projects till the deployment
- [00:44] part is actually covered all the things
- [00:46] is basically covered over here. Right?
- [00:48] So, we will be be focusing on how you
- [00:50] can build AIdriven automation, agent AI
- [00:53] workflows with NATN, right? NATN is also
- [00:56] becoming a one of the most popular no
- [00:58] coding platforms to build this kind of
- [01:00] workflows. Okay, this course is recorded
- [01:02] by M. Uh let me talk about M. He's a
- [01:05] very experienced professional who gives
- [01:08] corporate trainings, who helps
- [01:10] industries, companies to you know build
- [01:12] this kind of workflows with the help of
- [01:14] Neten itself. He has given many many
- [01:17] corporate trainings amazing feedback
- [01:19] from everyone out there right and then
- [01:21] here you'll be learning all these things
- [01:23] that is building AI automation workflow
- [01:25] using NIN integrate LLM from intelligent
- [01:27] actions creating agentic AI systems that
- [01:30] autonomously analyze design uh and
- [01:32] execute task connect N with APIs
- [01:35] databases apps to build end-to-end AI
- [01:37] pipelines and here you can also see that
- [01:39] deploying monitoring scaling AIdriven
- [01:41] workflows for production ready
- [01:43] automation so this way you will be
- [01:46] quickly able to develop any kind of
- [01:48] workflows with respect to any ideation
- [01:49] that you have. You know this is one of
- [01:52] the most important skill set that is
- [01:54] required right now because as soon as
- [01:56] you get a specific idea it is always
- [01:58] good to start with a P project and there
- [02:00] you can use no code tools like nin and
- [02:02] nin has been used by many many companies
- [02:05] out there because now with the help of
- [02:06] this you are able to build some amazing
- [02:09] end to-end projects directly you are
- [02:11] able to you know deploy your workflows
- [02:13] directly into the cloud right this
- [02:16] entire course is somewhere around 18
- [02:18] hours and we'll keep on getting updated
- [02:21] as we put up more projects in this
- [02:22] particular course. Right? So here you
- [02:24] can see introduction introduction to AI
- [02:26] automation and N10 foundation. We go
- [02:29] ahead and do the installation setup and
- [02:30] interfaces concepts nodes you know uh
- [02:33] automation with NAN join JSON with N.
- [02:37] You can see API with N AI in automation
- [02:39] agents in automation. Here you can see
- [02:42] pro social media automation GitHub PR
- [02:44] automation agent. So many different
- [02:46] different amazing topics you know from
- [02:48] chain of thoughts to agents parallel
- [02:51] workflow controller router agent react
- [02:54] agent where you don't have to do coding
- [02:56] with the help of the no coding tool that
- [02:58] is an inin we'll be implementing all
- [03:00] these things yes we can also use uh
- [03:03] other coding uh frameworks like lang
- [03:05] chain lang graph and do this that for
- [03:07] that I've created a separate course in
- [03:08] Udemy right and here you can see model
- [03:11] context protocol mcp uh in nitain cloud
- [03:14] uh running N on local and self-hosted
- [03:17] cloud rag everything is basically
- [03:19] covered you know we have also used
- [03:21] different kind of vector databases like
- [03:23] pine cone then you also have something
- [03:25] called as nitn self-hosting kit you know
- [03:29] uh then we have also built some projects
- [03:31] amazing projects end toend projects this
- [03:33] projects you can see like how like a
