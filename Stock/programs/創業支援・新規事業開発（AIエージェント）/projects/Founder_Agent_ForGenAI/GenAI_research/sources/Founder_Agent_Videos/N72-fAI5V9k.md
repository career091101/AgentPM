- [00:00] I'm delighted to introduce this course
- [00:02] on Nvidia's Nemo agent tokit in which
- [00:04] you learn to harden your agent that is
- [00:07] take it from a demo that maybe works
- [00:09] only half the time to reliable system
- [00:11] that delivers. This is taugh by Nvidia's
- [00:14] Brian McBrer.
- [00:16] Nvidia's open-source Nemo agent toolkit
- [00:19] or NAT provides a set of building blocks
- [00:22] for building reliable agents. If you've
- [00:24] already built an agent, say in raw
- [00:27] Python or using a framework like
- [00:29] Langraph or True AI, you can use NAT to
- [00:32] quickly build evals and add
- [00:34] observability.
- [00:36] Specifically, this toolkit gives you
- [00:37] tools to see the agent execution traces
- [00:41] so that if say it calls a wrong two, you
- [00:43] were to see what happened. It also
- [00:46] provides convenient tools to run evals
- [00:48] and makes CI/CD easy to implement. These
- [00:51] are sort of steps that help you turn
- [00:53] that proof of concept into something
- [00:55] reliable.
- [00:56] >> That's right, Andrew. There are a lot of
- [00:58] critical steps that need to [music] be
- [00:59] taken to make our agents ready to scale.
- [01:02] In this course, we're going to look at
- [01:03] how Nemo agent toolkit [music] makes it
- [01:05] far easier for you to manage these day 2
- [01:07] problems so your agentic applications
- [01:09] can be maintained and scaled reliably.
- [01:12] We'll illustrate these concepts with a
- [01:13] climate chatbot that uses tools and show
- [01:16] what the process of making it reliable
- [01:17] is like using NAT. You'll add
- [01:20] observability and evaluation. You'll
- [01:22] also see how NAT can serve the agent as
- [01:24] an API. [music]
- [01:25] And you'll be using a neat feature of
- [01:27] NAT, its configurationdriven workflows.
- [01:30] You can just write and edit YAML to
- [01:32] reconfigure your agents quickly. Beyond
- [01:34] single agent applications, NAT also
- [01:37] supports multi- aent workflows across a
- [01:39] variety of agent frameworks. So you
- [01:42] would plug NAT's observability and eval
- [01:45] capabilities to optimize and make
- [01:47] reliable even complex multi- aent
- [01:49] multi-framework workflows. I hope you
- [01:52] enjoy exploring what's possible in this
- [01:54] course.
