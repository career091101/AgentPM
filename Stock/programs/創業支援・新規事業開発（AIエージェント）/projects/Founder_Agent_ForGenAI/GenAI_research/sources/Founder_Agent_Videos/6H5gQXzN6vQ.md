- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Prash Nayak and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys
- [00:04] uh recently Google has announced its own
- [00:07] ID which is called as Google
- [00:08] anti-gravity
- [00:10] and this specific ID is like a next
- [00:12] generation ID which supports agentic AI
- [00:14] development and all uh you will be able
- [00:17] to it's it's kind of a competitor for
- [00:19] cursor also uh VS code also and I have I
- [00:22] hope you have seen me making
- [00:24] applications in VS code in cursor. So in
- [00:27] this specific video, this is the first
- [00:29] time that I'm using this. Uh I have just
- [00:32] downloaded the .exe file. Uh we'll make
- [00:34] this video a little bit interesting. Uh
- [00:36] so that you'll also understand that how
- [00:38] I specifically do my research, how uh I
- [00:42] like any new thing comes, you know, uh
- [00:44] how do I probably go ahead with it? You
- [00:46] know, what are the important things that
- [00:47] I usually check, right? So please make
- [00:50] sure that you watch this video till the
- [00:51] end. we will go ahead step by step in
- [00:53] understanding what all uh amazing things
- [00:56] this ID can actually do. Okay. So first
- [00:58] of all uh the Google anti-gravity here
- [01:00] you can see that it is the next
- [01:02] generation ID. Here you have lot of use
- [01:05] cases like here you have three main use
- [01:08] cases. Uh if I probably talk about one
- [01:10] is professional, front end and full
- [01:12] stack. When we talk about professional,
- [01:14] at its core, anti-gravity is still a
- [01:16] fully featured AI ID, but the agent
- [01:19] manager provides a new mission control
- [01:21] surface for background agents to tackle
- [01:23] backlog task, perform codebased
- [01:25] research, and reduce context switching.
- [01:27] Okay. And recently, if you know, Google
- [01:30] has also come up with its Giny 3 uh and
- [01:33] five. By far, it is probably the best
- [01:36] model, I guess, uh because uh we were
- [01:38] seeing the metrics, it was very very
- [01:40] good when compared to the other models,
- [01:41] right? And if you can see over here if I
- [01:44] just go ahead and click on explore use
- [01:45] cases uh with respect to professionals
- [01:48] uh you can do a lot of task here you can
- [01:50] see Google anti-gravity streamlined
- [01:52] workflows by offering tools for
- [01:53] parallelization customization and
- [01:55] efficient knowledge management
- [01:57] um and there are like you know
- [02:00] background agents codebased
- [02:01] understanding uh you can actually do
- [02:04] reduce context switching build for trust
- [02:06] and there are a lot of videos also which
- [02:08] we which you can also see for this right
- [02:11] and then You have another features like
- [02:13] for front end you can use browser in the
- [02:16] loop iteration that basically means if
- [02:18] you're doing the coding probably on the
- [02:20] left hand side on the right hand side
- [02:21] you can directly see how the UI may
- [02:24] actually look right so that will
- [02:26] actually give you the visual feedback
- [02:27] which is really really good uh you know
- [02:30] because you have a kind of a browser
- [02:31] integration kind of stuff over there
- [02:33] right and there is also one more which
- [02:35] is called as full stack uh it places an
- [02:38] emphasis on verification communication
- [02:39] to user via artifacts and all Right. And
- [02:42] here uh there is also kind of pricing uh
- [02:44] individual plan. This is the best thing
- [02:47] about Google. It launches everything for
- [02:48] free. So here you have $0 per month. And
- [02:52] uh you will be having access to Gemini 3
- [02:54] Pro which is good. Cloud set 4.5 which
- [02:57] uh you know cloud code also has this
- [02:59] specific model GPT OSS which is an open
- [03:02] source model also right? Unlimited tab
- [03:05] completion unlimited command request
- [03:06] generous rate limit. So this is the best
- [03:08] thing about Google. It provides you for
- [03:10] free. It has huge amount of money. So
- [03:12] you can go ahead and try it out. Okay.
- [03:14] Now let's go ahead and download it. So
- [03:16] for downloading all you have to do is
- [03:17] just click over here. I have already
- [03:18] downloaded it over here. Right. And uh
- [03:21] as soon I started the execution. Here
- [03:23] you can see that the first option that I
- [03:25] got was to choose the editor theme type.
- [03:28] Uh I have selected dark. And here you
- [03:31] can see there are a lot of options.
- [03:32] Agentdriven development, agent assisted
- [03:35] development, reviewdriven development,
- [03:36] custom configuration. So let's say that
- [03:38] you are a kind of a VIP coding guy. You
- [03:41] can go ahead with agent-driven
- [03:42] development. But I would like to have
- [03:44] agent assisted development because I
- [03:46] still believe I'm a good developer and
- [03:48] uh review policies. Agent decides here
- [03:51] you can also select always proceed
- [03:52] request review. Uh all these things are
- [03:55] so right now we'll keep this use the
- [03:57] default alloy list for the browser. I'll
- [03:59] go ahead and select next. Configure your
- [04:01] keyboard binding. There is options
- [04:03] normal. uh there are some seven
- [04:06] extensions popular extension it is going
- [04:08] to install and it is also going to have
- [04:10] a command line tool to open anti-gravity
- [04:12] with agy okay now I can go ahead and
- [04:15] sign it with Google I will go ahead and
- [04:17] use one of my email id for doing that
- [04:19] and once I do that I think we should be
- [04:22] able to open the anti-gravity perfect so
- [04:26] now it is setting up as our account okay
- [04:28] we'll go step by step I'm also using it
- [04:31] for the first time okay so this looks
- [04:33] code here you can see uh the UI is is
- [04:38] almost like VS code but VS code has more
- [04:41] information right uh here I've also
- [04:43] opened cursor so you can see cursor is
- [04:46] over here okay and in the cursor also
- [04:49] you'll be able to find uh on the right
- [04:51] hand side there will be a chat for the
- [04:53] agent and all right so this is how my
- [04:56] anti-gravity this looks like I can open
- [04:58] my folder so let's say that I go ahead
- [05:01] and open any of the project So many
- [05:03] different projects that I have actually
- [05:05] created you know. So let's open some
- [05:08] cloudy projects stock rack. Okay I I'll
- [05:10] just open this particular project. Okay
- [05:12] just type trust author. So this is my
- [05:14] entire project structure. Again it looks
- [05:16] good over here. Let me hide my face so
- [05:19] that you'll be able to see this. Uh this
- [05:21] is the agent here. You can actually do
- [05:24] planning each and everything. I'll
- [05:25] dismiss this. Okay. See planning fast
- [05:28] agent can plan before executing task.
- [05:30] Use for deep research and all. agent
- [05:32] will execute the task directly used for
- [05:35] simple task that can be compiled faster
- [05:37] and here you have lot of options with
- [05:39] respect to the model again as said it is
- [05:42] free for a specific user you can go
- [05:43] ahead and try it out right so here I'll
- [05:45] just go ahead and ask a question uh
- [05:47] explain me about the code base okay so
- [05:54] now probably we'll go ahead and hit this
- [05:55] particular request and see uh it is
- [05:58] examining the code structure it is fast
- [06:00] it is fast this is really good I think
- [06:02] I'm going to probably switch to the
- [06:04] anti-gravity. Um, but still I have that
- [06:08] very good feeling about VS Code because
- [06:09] I've been using it for a long time. But,
- [06:13] uh, this looks good, you know, and uh,
- [06:15] let me just zoom in so that you will
- [06:17] also be able to see this. So, here it is
- [06:19] analyzing all the projects uh, run
- [06:21] injection, run API. So, I've created a
- [06:24] lot many things over here, right? So,
- [06:26] here is my source folder. I have this
- [06:28] embedding. I I was basically creating a
- [06:30] rag application. So here you'll be able
- [06:32] to see everything and it is doing really
- [06:35] fast is using this Germany 3 pro and it
- [06:38] is probably making that specific
- [06:39] decisions quickly right this is good and
- [06:43] this free version can definitely be very
- [06:45] very important for all the people out
- [06:47] there who do not like to pay any kind of
- [06:49] money for the pro version. So getting
- [06:51] started to run the system you typically
- [06:53] set up your environment with open AI API
- [06:55] key python run this one python run API
- [06:58] to start the server each and every
- [06:59] information you are basically given uh
- [07:02] let's say that I go ahead and ask can
- [07:04] you provide some
- [07:07] improvements on the code
- [07:10] on the code
- [07:12] just
- [07:14] suggest okay so let's say that I've
- [07:17] again asked some of the questions uh
- [07:19] we'll see some more uh options with this
- [07:22] coding agent edit code in line all the
- [07:25] things uh one by one okay so here you
- [07:27] can see I'm diving into this this this
- [07:29] all the information is there reading
- [07:31] vector stroke crawl and implementation
- [07:33] everything is there okay um then we will
- [07:36] see this three important functionalities
- [07:38] that it has right and I feel this is the
- [07:40] future guys uh you have to probably do
- [07:43] the development with the help of agents
- [07:45] uh that is what we can actually see okay
- [07:48] uh one thing that I could not see over
- [07:50] Here just a second if I go ahead and
- [07:51] write okay images option is also there
- [07:53] workflow option is also there mention
- [07:55] you can add context based on this but I
- [07:58] did not see any MCP options uh which
- [08:00] usually cursor usually uh cloud code
- [08:04] usually has but this does not have that
- [08:06] basically means it is just focusing on
- [08:08] itself I've analyzed the core and list
- [08:10] recommended uh this one uh recommended
- [08:12] improvements so here you can see all the
- [08:14] information is basically there now let's
- [08:16] uh do one thing let's uh open the agent
- [08:19] agent manager once I'll just go ahead
- [08:21] and press Ctrl E. So here you can see
- [08:24] that uh it is an agent manager. You can
- [08:27] start the conversation. Uh here is the
- [08:29] agent manager. When you do ctrl E agent
- [08:33] manager basically uh uh it it starts
- [08:36] agents on task like deep research
- [08:38] longunning projects or background task
- [08:40] you can monitor the progress of multiple
- [08:42] agents and all are there right? So I'll
- [08:44] go ahead and say okay you can probably
- [08:46] open any number of agents in short.
- [08:48] Right? So that is what this is all
- [08:50] about. Uh if you want to try coding with
- [08:52] code with agents uh I will just press
- [08:55] Ctrl L which is this one. Okay. And edit
- [08:58] code inline Ctrl I. Let's open my fun
- [09:01] file. Ctrl I. So here you can see do you
- [09:04] want to install the uh recommended
- [09:06] Python extension for MS Python? Yes,
- [09:08] I'll go ahead and install it. So here
- [09:09] you can go ahead and install any kind of
- [09:13] uh um you know extensions that you
- [09:16] specifically require. And if you really
- [09:18] want to start with any kind of ID, you
- [09:20] need to have installation of Python and
- [09:22] all, right? If you want to go ahead and
- [09:24] start it, right? So if you want to go
- [09:26] ahead and execute it. So that that
- [09:28] option is there. So you you can go ahead
- [09:30] and install it. I will close this. Okay.
- [09:33] So mostly these are the functions. Along
- [09:35] with this, you have this one. You have
- [09:38] options of committing the code. All the
- [09:41] ID functionality is almost same. Nothing
- [09:43] so different. But I think this three are
- [09:46] there. The best thing for the user is
- [09:48] that you have you use it completely for
- [09:50] free. You can actually work with uh any
- [09:53] kind of agents over here. You can do
- [09:55] wipe coding. Uh the look and feel um I
- [09:59] would not say exactly it is like VS
- [10:00] code. It is a little bit different but
- [10:03] you know at the end of the day you don't
- [10:05] have to do anything you need you if you
- [10:07] believe in Google Germany models uh
- [10:10] which they actually providing you to for
- [10:12] completely for free can go ahead and
- [10:14] start planning and executing your code
- [10:15] with respect to this. Okay that was uh
- [10:19] most of it but all the other tasks that
- [10:21] you actually do in most of the projects
- [10:24] this can be really really handy. Okay.
- [10:26] Now let me do one thing. Let me go ahead
- [10:28] and create one project from scratch so
- [10:30] that you can also see that how fast it
- [10:33] can actually do it. Okay. So I'll go to
- [10:36] aentic AI. I will make a new folder
- [10:38] saying that okay this is my anti-gravity
- [10:41] demo. I will start completely from
- [10:43] scratch. I will open this.
- [10:47] Okay let's open this particular folder.
- [10:50] open folder
- [10:52] cloudy agentic AI
- [10:56] and let me see anti-gravity demo okay so
- [11:00] here it is uh yes I trust the authors
- [11:03] let's open the terminal the terminal
- [11:05] also looks almost same like how it is
- [11:08] for GitHub copilot okay command prompt
- [11:11] let's see I will go ahead and write uv
- [11:13] in it so it is initialized this
- [11:16] particular project repository I will go
- [11:18] ahead and write uvv and
- [11:20] So this is my environment.
- [11:23] Okay. I will go ahead and activate
- [11:26] things. Okay. And uh quickly I will go
- [11:29] ahead and write UV add let's say fast
- [11:33] API. I want to go ahead and add this
- [11:35] particular packages. Okay. Clear the
- [11:38] screen. Okay. Now I can go ahead and say
- [11:40] hey uh create a simple calculator.
- [11:47] calculator
- [11:51] app with fast API. Okay, the reason why
- [11:56] I'm using fast API is basically that I
- [11:58] can actually run this also. Okay, now it
- [12:00] is probably planning and it does not
- [12:02] have anything as such. Here you can see
- [12:04] that uh uh UV also it is able to detect
- [12:07] because you have this pi project to ml
- [12:10] file. So here you have installed pi fast
- [12:13] uh API. Okay. And now here you can see
- [12:16] right all the information is basically
- [12:18] coming up. See
- [12:21] now let's see uh open implementation
- [12:23] plan. So I will go ahead and open it. I
- [12:25] will proceed it. Okay something is
- [12:27] coming over here. I'll dismiss this.
- [12:29] Okay implementation plan. So this is the
- [12:31] plan. It probably creates this create a
- [12:34] simple plan calculator. Uh
- [12:37] here you can see I'll go ahead and
- [12:39] accept this. It'll run the command.
- [12:41] Everything is happening. You can see
- [12:43] modify main.py py all the information is
- [12:45] basically here and then you can execute
- [12:48] it by using this command uicon right so
- [12:52] I will go ahead and accept it
- [12:55] uicon is also been executed see the
- [12:57] command is also getting executed and I
- [12:59] hope so it is basically getting executed
- [13:01] within the same environment right and
- [13:04] here you can see all the information see
- [13:06] terminal things everything is basically
- [13:08] happening the UI uh still the UI needs
- [13:11] to be better but I feel Yeah, if if a
- [13:15] normal developer is there, I think he
- [13:17] should be able to understand it. Okay,
- [13:19] implemented backend logic. So in the
- [13:21] main.py, you can see all the information
- [13:23] is there. I will accept this. Okay.
- [13:28] Accept it.
- [13:30] And then you can see that we can run
- [13:32] this particular command in order to go
- [13:35] ahead and execute this. Okay.
- [13:43] So now you can just open this particular
- [13:45] link and your calculator has started.
- [13:49] Yeah. So everything is working
- [13:51] absolutely fine. So see how quickly
- [13:53] within just a couple of minute. Okay.
- [13:57] And I can just say stop the app. Okay.
- [14:00] When we say stop the app, you will be
- [14:02] able to see that it'll just go ahead and
- [14:04] close the app. From here also you can go
- [14:06] ahead and execute it. Uh uh from this
- [14:09] side also you can go ahead and execute
- [14:11] it. Right? So overall I liked the
- [14:15] anti-gravity. You should also definitely
- [14:17] go ahead and try it out. This was it
- [14:18] from my side. I hope you like this
- [14:20] particular video. Please do make sure to
- [14:22] hit like share with all your friends.
- [14:23] I'll see you all in the next video.
- [14:24] Bye-bye. Ticker.
