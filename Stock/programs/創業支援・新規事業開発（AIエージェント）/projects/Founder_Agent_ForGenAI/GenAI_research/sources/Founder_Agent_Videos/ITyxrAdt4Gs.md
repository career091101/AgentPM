- [00:10] faster, more automated way to extract
- [00:12] meaning and act on it. Ivia is using
- [00:16] Agentic AI to do exactly that. Training
- [00:19] AI agents to navigate more than a
- [00:22] million data streams for clinical,
- [00:24] medical, and commercial professionals.

- [00:29] combines a growing set of AI agents,
- [00:31] each designed to streamline how insights

- [01:03] prescription patterns,
- [01:06] then recommends a personalized next step
- [01:08] for the salesperson,
- [01:10] making every interaction more targeted
- [01:12] and effective.
- [01:14] By connecting data with expertise, IQ
