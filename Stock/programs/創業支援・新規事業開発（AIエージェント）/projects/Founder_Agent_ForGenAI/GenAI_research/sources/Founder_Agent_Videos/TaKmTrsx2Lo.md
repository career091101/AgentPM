- [00:00] I figured out a workflow for claude code
- [00:02] that will absolutely blow your mind. It
- [00:04] will have you building apps faster than
- [00:06] you ever have before. Even if you've
- [00:08] never in a line of code in your life,
- [00:09] doesn't matter if this is your first
- [00:10] time using Claude Code or you're a
- [00:12] Claude Code master. The skills you're
- [00:14] about to learn in this video will change
- [00:16] how you use AI forever. If you stick
- [00:18] with me, 20 minutes from right now,
- [00:21] you'll be coming up with endless ideas
- [00:23] for apps you can build. You'll be
- [00:24] spinning up armies of AI agents to build
- [00:26] it. and you'll be able to ship an app
- [00:28] that you can start making money on
- [00:30] today. Let's get into it. Let's go
- [00:32] through the setup first. What you see
- [00:34] here is on the right, Visual Studio Code
- [00:37] with the Claude Code extension. I'll
- [00:39] have the link to Visual Studio Code down
- [00:41] below. It is completely free. No monthly
- [00:44] subscription, nothing like that. I use
- [00:46] the Claude Code extension. To download
- [00:48] that, all you have to do is go into the
- [00:51] extension section of Visual Studio Code.
- [00:54] You type in claude code, you hit
- [00:55] install, and boom, you have the claude
- [00:58] code extension installed. There's many
- [01:00] ways you can use cloud code. The CLI,
- [01:02] the extension inside cursor inside
- [01:04] Visual Studio. For me, my preferred
- [01:07] workflow is the extension inside Visual
- [01:09] Studio because Visual Studio Code is
- [01:11] free and very, very dependable. I've
- [01:13] never had an issue with extensions.
- [01:14] Sometimes I have issues installing
- [01:16] extensions inside Cursor. And I like the
- [01:19] extension for claude code rather than
- [01:21] through the CLI because I like the UI
- [01:23] just so much more. It's so much easier
- [01:25] to use, cleaner, and you have some extra
- [01:26] features that are very nice for quality
- [01:28] of life. Over on the left hand side,
- [01:31] what you see here is Claude Code for
- [01:33] web. The newest feature for Claude Code,
- [01:36] which will be going through here, you're
- [01:37] not going to see this feature in any
- [01:38] other video on YouTube. This is their
- [01:41] basically cloud platform where you can
- [01:44] spin up as many agents as you want that
- [01:46] will work on your app for you that will
- [01:48] develop ideas that will do anything you
- [01:50] want. It's really really amazing and
- [01:52] I'll be going through that as well and
- [01:53] show you how these two things work
- [01:55] together to superpower your workflow.
- [01:58] When I get these two working together in
- [02:00] this video, it's it's going to be
- [02:01] harmony. It's going to be beautiful.
- [02:02] It's like directing an orchestra of AI
- [02:04] agents. You got to stick with me here. I
- [02:06] highly recommend working with me as we
- [02:08] do the video. So, feel free to pause
- [02:09] right now, download Visual Studio Code.
- [02:12] You only really need the $20 version of
- [02:14] Claude to use Claude Code. So, feel free
- [02:17] to sign up for that. If you like it, if
- [02:19] you build this app out with me, then you
- [02:21] can sign up for one of the more
- [02:22] expensive versions so you get a lot more
- [02:23] usage. But for the sake of this video,
- [02:24] feel free to do the $20 version. We can
- [02:26] get this app running. But let's do this.
- [02:29] Let's start building our app. Today, we
- [02:31] are going to be building a project
- [02:33] management tool. I like to build apps
- [02:36] that I can use every single day that
- [02:38] make my life easier. That's the best
- [02:40] type of app to build, ones that you use
- [02:42] yourself because even if no one buys and
- [02:43] you make zero dollars, your life's
- [02:44] getting easier. So, we're going to build
- [02:46] a project management tool today that
- [02:48] allows us to organize our ideas,
- [02:50] organize our tasks, and be way more
- [02:52] productive. I want to basically build a
- [02:53] canban board similar to this that we can
- [02:55] use on our own every single day to
- [02:57] manage our projects. So, let's do this.
- [03:00] Let's start with the design of our app.
- [03:02] What our app is going to look like. I
- [03:04] promise this is something you haven't
- [03:05] seen in any other video. We're going to
- [03:07] make sure this app looks good rather
- [03:09] than like AI slop which you'll typically
- [03:10] get if you start building an app with no
- [03:12] design inspiration. And where we're
- [03:14] going to start for this, this is one of
- [03:15] the new parts of my workflow I just
- [03:17] figured out is actually with Vzero. So
- [03:19] if you log into Vzero, which has a free
- [03:21] tier, you can go to this section right
- [03:24] here on the left, which is design
- [03:25] systems. You don't have to pay for this.
- [03:27] This is not me trying to get you sign up
- [03:28] for another service. They just have a
- [03:30] free section in here that I really,
- [03:31] really like, which is this design
- [03:33] systems. And what we're going to do is
- [03:35] choose a design for our app and
- [03:38] basically export it from V 0 to claude
- [03:41] code really, really easily. So, I like
- [03:43] this soft pop here. This soft pop looks
- [03:45] nice. Let's open this up in the editor.
- [03:46] I like the way these colors look, the
- [03:48] way they pop. So, we're going to do this
- [03:50] to get the design in the clawed code.
- [03:53] Literally, all we're going to do is I'm
- [03:54] just going to screenshot this. So, I
- [03:56] chose the design I like. I'm going to on
- [03:59] Mac screenshot it like this. If you're
- [04:02] on Mac you can do shift controlcommand
- [04:04] 4. That actually just copies the screen
- [04:06] and then you can paste it in. I'm going
- [04:08] to take this design and then I'm going
- [04:10] to go in here and I'm going to go back
- [04:11] into claw code. I'm going to paste in
- [04:13] that screenshot and we're going to do
- [04:15] this. This is going to be the prompt for
- [04:17] our app. I'm going to put this down
- [04:18] below too if you just want to copy and
- [04:20] paste it and put it in. Right before we
- [04:22] do that though, real quick and this is a
- [04:23] very important step. We're going to do
- [04:25] slashmodel and we're going to say select
- [04:28] model and we're going to choose haiku
- [04:30] 4.5. The reason we're doing this is very
- [04:32] very simple. What's going to happen is
- [04:35] haiku 4.5 is the cheapest quickest model
- [04:38] from anthropic. And the way it's going
- [04:40] to work is it's going to use sonnet 45
- [04:42] which is their best model for planning.
- [04:45] So it's going to use their best model
- [04:46] build out the really nice in-depth
- [04:48] plans. Then it's going to use haiku for
- [04:50] the execution. And as long as you got a
- [04:53] really good plan, which is what Sonnet
- [04:54] is going to do, Haiku is going to be
- [04:56] able to build that out really, really
- [04:58] well and you're going to save a ton of
- [04:59] money. So, you'll be able to get way
- [05:01] more usage out of a $20 tier if that's
- [05:02] what you're doing. I highly recommend
- [05:04] everyone use this. You select Haiku and
- [05:06] it'll use Sonnet for planning and the
- [05:08] cheap model Haiku for the execution,
- [05:10] which you'll get just as good results
- [05:12] with. Now that we did that, let's paste
- [05:14] in the prompt. You can copy and paste it
- [05:16] from down below in the description and
- [05:18] build this alongside with me. I want to
- [05:20] build a project management app for vibe
- [05:21] coding apps. Basically, the way I want
- [05:23] it to work is it's a cananband board
- [05:24] with todo, in progress, and completed
- [05:27] sections. Plus, I can add more if I
- [05:29] want. I can add cards to the canban
- [05:31] board for tasks and add notes to the
- [05:33] cards. The app should look like the
- [05:35] design in the screenshot I attached and
- [05:37] be beautiful and nice to use animations,
- [05:39] especially when I drag the cards. Use
- [05:41] Nex.js and Tailwind V3 for this. Just
- [05:44] use local storage for now. No off. Next.
- [05:46] JS and Tailwind 1V3 are the web
- [05:48] technologies we're going to use to build
- [05:49] the app. It's like the most popular
- [05:50] technologies out there right now. So,
- [05:52] it'll be very easy to build your apps
- [05:54] out. Before we send this prompt, we're
- [05:56] just going to hit shift tab twice, which
- [05:59] will put us in plan mode, which you see
- [06:00] right there. And if you're brand new to
- [06:02] Claude Code, this is just the mode where
- [06:03] it's not going to write any code. It's
- [06:05] just going to build us out a very
- [06:06] detailed plan with Sonnet 45, which is
- [06:08] going to make the code generation so
- [06:10] much more powerful. You want to use plan
- [06:13] mode before you do any major step. The
- [06:16] only times I'm not using plan mode is if
- [06:17] I'm doing really really simple tasks
- [06:19] like changing just a UI element. But
- [06:22] anything more than just changing a UI
- [06:23] element. You want to use plan. It might
- [06:25] add just an extra step here and there.
- [06:28] But I promise adding this extra step
- [06:30] will have you moving so much faster
- [06:31] because the AI is going to write only
- [06:33] reliable code. So we're in plan mode.
- [06:35] Let's hit send. The AI is going to start
- [06:37] working. It's going to use signet 45 to
- [06:39] build out this plan for us. Then we're
- [06:41] going to approve it right after. I can't
- [06:43] wait to get into the next steps of this
- [06:45] workflow with you, especially when we
- [06:47] start looping in claw code for web and I
- [06:49] show you how you can spin up an army of
- [06:51] AI agents that's going to do work for
- [06:53] you while we work on the app, even while
- [06:56] we're sleeping. So, here we go. It set
- [06:58] up the plan for us. This is awesome. So,
- [07:00] it's going to initialize the project.
- [07:02] It's going to configure the CSS. It's
- [07:04] going to install a bunch of libraries
- [07:06] that will make the animations nice for
- [07:07] us. And listen, if you're brand new to
- [07:09] coding or you're not very technical,
- [07:11] that's fine. You don't have to worry
- [07:12] about the technical part. Just make sure
- [07:14] you go through the plan to make sure it
- [07:16] sounds generally right. So, it's going
- [07:18] to create the cananband board and data
- [07:19] structure. It's going to build the board
- [07:21] out. It's going to implement the
- [07:22] columns. It's going to create the card
- [07:24] components and it's going to add all the
- [07:25] nice polish and animations, which is
- [07:27] great. Again, I like Nex.js because
- [07:29] there's tons of documentation for it
- [07:31] online. These AIs heavily rely on
- [07:34] documentation, so it's very easy to find
- [07:36] that and build out your app for you. So,
- [07:38] I like this plan, right? If you didn't
- [07:39] like the plan, you can say no, keep
- [07:41] planning and ask it to do other things
- [07:42] or change the plan. Let's hit yes on
- [07:44] this. It is going to start building out
- [07:47] that app. By the way, I say yes and
- [07:49] don't ask again. I fully trust Claude
- [07:51] Code. I've used this a 100,000 times. It
- [07:54] very rarely messes up. So, I just say
- [07:56] yes and don't ask again. And it builds
- [07:57] it out. While that works and builds out
- [08:00] the app, I'm going to go into one of the
- [08:02] most important stages of our workflow,
- [08:05] which is kind of the brainstorming,
- [08:07] coming up with idea stage. And for the
- [08:10] ideation stage, I really like this tool,
- [08:12] tick tick. It is completely free. You
- [08:14] can download that, but you can also do
- [08:15] this in Apple notes or Google notes or
- [08:17] whatever you use. You don't need
- [08:19] anything fancy for this, but I think
- [08:20] it's really important you do this stage
- [08:22] of the workflow. Not many people are
- [08:24] doing this, and I think it's critical.
- [08:25] This is your project management stage.
- [08:28] This is how you're going to manage your
- [08:29] ideas, organi organize your ideas, and
- [08:31] come up with new things to build out and
- [08:34] it's going to make communicating with
- [08:35] Claude Code so much easier. So, as
- [08:38] Claude Code builds out, I like to go
- [08:39] into my project management tool. So,
- [08:42] whether it's Apple Notes, I use Tick
- [08:43] Tick. And what you do is just brain dump
- [08:46] ideas for your app, for features, for
- [08:48] whatever you're building in here, right?
- [08:50] So, we're building our own project
- [08:51] management tool, which is kind of meta.
- [08:53] and we're going to go let's go into in
- [08:54] progress and this is what we're building
- [08:55] now and say build the base application.
- [09:00] So that's what we're working on now in
- [09:02] progress. But let's come up with some
- [09:03] more ideas for to-do here and I'm going
- [09:05] to show you some ways to use AI to
- [09:07] actually come up with way more ideas in
- [09:08] a second once we go into cloud code for
- [09:10] web. So we can come up with some new
- [09:11] ideas for tasks here. Let's do generate
- [09:15] AI prompts in each card. So I want to be
- [09:18] able to when I'm inside our project
- [09:20] management tool in each card say
- [09:21] generate prompt so that we can take the
- [09:24] prompts and put in the cloud code if
- [09:26] we're like managing our vibe coding apps
- [09:27] in our new project management tool. So
- [09:29] I'm going to hit enter on that. We can
- [09:31] say login/off
- [09:34] database customize the look and feel AI
- [09:39] functionality. Right? We're just coming
- [09:41] up and brainstorming and and dumping our
- [09:43] ideas for our app into here. And then as
- [09:46] we build this out, as I go later into
- [09:48] this workflow and we're using clawed web
- [09:50] and we're spinning up AI agents, we can
- [09:52] just start taking all these ideas we're
- [09:54] brain dumping and give them to the AI
- [09:56] agents to build on their own. A lot of
- [09:59] people, they just go in here and they
- [10:00] just go in cloud code and they just kind
- [10:02] of type their ideas as they come. You
- [10:03] want to stay organized and this is the
- [10:06] best way to stay organized. Again, this
- [10:08] is adding an extra step, but with this
- [10:10] extra step, it will speed up your
- [10:12] workflow so much more at the end of the
- [10:14] day. So, as we do this, pull open an
- [10:15] Apple notes if you want. Download Tick
- [10:17] Tick if you want. Whatever you want. A
- [10:18] lot of people use Linear. That's kind of
- [10:20] the hot trending new project management
- [10:21] tool. Whatever you want to use. It
- [10:24] doesn't have to get complicated. I'm not
- [10:25] trying to sell you on these tools here.
- [10:27] Just pull one open. Brain dump your
- [10:29] idea. So, when we get later into this
- [10:31] workflow, when we start doing a lot
- [10:32] cooler things with Claude for Web, you
- [10:34] can just start pulling these out and
- [10:35] build them out with me. As this is
- [10:37] going, just as a side note, I get this
- [10:39] question a thousand times a day. Why
- [10:40] Claude Code? Why not Codeex? Why not
- [10:42] Cursor 2.0? Noise Encursor 2.0,
- [10:44] Incredible, all that. I'm just going to
- [10:46] be honest with you as this builds out.
- [10:48] I'm not getting paid by any of these
- [10:50] companies. I'm not sponsored. I have no
- [10:52] loyalty here. Enthropic isn't paying me
- [10:54] here. Although, Enthropic, listen, if
- [10:56] you want a sponsor video, more than
- [10:57] happy to do it. Uh, but the reason why I
- [11:00] talk about Claude Code so much and this
- [11:02] video is all about Claude Code workflows
- [11:04] and I developed this workflow so much is
- [11:05] just in my opinion, at the end of the
- [11:07] day, Cloud Code is the best AI coding
- [11:08] tool out there right now. Just period,
- [11:10] end of story. I've used them all. For
- [11:12] me, Claude Code is just the most
- [11:13] reliable and writes the best code and
- [11:15] and doesn't put me in error loops and is
- [11:17] just the most beginner friendly. It just
- [11:20] gives me the best results and that's why
- [11:21] all my videos are about them. All right.
- [11:23] Boom. It's all done working here.
- [11:24] Perfect. Your Vive Canban project
- [11:26] management app is now complete and ready
- [11:28] to use. It shows me all the features it
- [11:30] built out. And this is another thing I
- [11:31] love about Claude Code 2 is just its
- [11:34] descriptions of what it builds and how
- [11:36] it talks to you. Like I know this is
- [11:38] kind of a crazy thing to say. It might
- [11:40] be all hippie- dippy, but at the end of
- [11:41] the day, like vibes are a thing. I think
- [11:44] when it comes to talking to AI, like
- [11:45] that's a critical thing for me is the
- [11:47] vibes. And I'm going to be honest with
- [11:48] you, out of all the AI tools out there,
- [11:50] Claude Code, just the way it
- [11:52] communicates to me is so warm. It's so
- [11:54] friendly. It feels like a partner
- [11:56] developer. It doesn't feel like it's
- [11:58] talking down to me. It's not super
- [12:00] technical. It feels like it talks at my
- [12:02] level. And it's just super pleasant and
- [12:04] easy to read all the descriptions. And
- [12:07] that's another reason why I just really
- [12:08] enjoy using this tool. But like this is
- [12:10] just great. Like I can see the core
- [12:11] features really easily, the design and
- [12:14] UX. I'm not a fan of overuse of emojis,
- [12:16] but I think it's tasteful the way they
- [12:18] use emojis in this the structuring where
- [12:20] I can see the project structure really
- [12:22] well. It's just super easy to read all
- [12:23] this and understand what they did. I
- [12:25] think for you, even if you're not very
- [12:26] technical, make sure you take the time
- [12:28] and just read the summary of what it
- [12:30] built so you can just be super intimate
- [12:31] with your app. Again, I don't need I
- [12:33] don't think you need to know how to read
- [12:34] code to do any of this, but just be in
- [12:36] just be familiar with how your app works
- [12:38] and go through this and see what it
- [12:39] built out. So, let's do this. I hit
- [12:41] control till day on Mac to bring up the
- [12:44] terminal right here. And then we do npm
- [12:46] rundev and we hit enter. And that is
- [12:48] going to run our app. And as you can see
- [12:50] here, localhost 3000. I'm going to hold
- [12:53] command and then click there. All right,
- [12:55] here we go. Let me make this bigger
- [12:56] here. Wow, that's nice. That looks good.
- [12:58] So, this is the V1 of our cananband
- [13:00] board. I'm going to show you how to do a
- [13:01] lot more things right now after this,
- [13:03] including adding features, using clawed
- [13:05] web, and a whole bunch of other little
- [13:06] tips and tricks. But that is really
- [13:08] sick. That's a good V1. It is better
- [13:10] than your standard uh UI I think you get
- [13:13] with AI because we included that
- [13:15] screenshot. Usually get the purple and
- [13:17] the blue gradients. There's not a single
- [13:19] purple or blue gradient to be seen here.
- [13:21] And when I click and drag, oh, that's
- [13:23] nice. You get that nice animation for
- [13:25] clicking and dragging. That's really
- [13:26] good. So, congrats if this is your first
- [13:28] time ever building with AI. You just
- [13:30] built your first app. But we're not even
- [13:32] 10% done here. Let's start adding a lot
- [13:34] more cool things to this and I'll show
- [13:35] you the rest of my workflow. So to get
- [13:37] Claude for web working, which is a
- [13:39] critical part of this workflow, we need
- [13:42] to put this app on GitHub. GitHub is an
- [13:44] online repository for code that Claude
- [13:47] code will hook into so that their AI
- [13:49] agents can do work for us while we sleep
- [13:51] if we want. So do this. Go to
- [13:52] github.com.
- [13:54] Make an account here if you haven't
- [13:55] already. Completely free. We're going to
- [13:58] create a new repository for this. We're
- [14:00] going to call it project management app.
- [14:03] Going to go down here. You can make it
- [14:05] private if you want. And then we're
- [14:06] going to click create repository. Once
- [14:09] that is set up, we are going to copy
- [14:12] this address for the repository and
- [14:14] we're going to go back into cloud code.
- [14:16] Now we're going to say please commit
- [14:19] this code to and then we're going to put
- [14:22] the address right there and we're going
- [14:24] to hit enter. And now what Claude Code
- [14:26] will do is take all our code and put it
- [14:29] into that GitHub repository. Now, if
- [14:31] this is your first time ever using
- [14:33] GitHub, ever using it in Claude Code,
- [14:35] there's going to be a couple extra login
- [14:37] steps where it'll say, "Hey, please log
- [14:38] into your GitHub and do a couple things
- [14:40] there." If you get confused as it goes
- [14:42] to say, "Hey, I don't know why this
- [14:44] isn't working." You screenshot it, give
- [14:45] it to Claude Code. Cloud Code will fix
- [14:47] it for you. It'll understand what you
- [14:48] need to do. That should just take a
- [14:50] couple minutes. But if you used GitHub
- [14:51] before, you can just say yes and don't
- [14:53] ask again and it will initiate all this
- [14:55] for us. That will commit our code. I hit
- [14:58] yes here. And again, don't worry, you
- [14:59] don't need to be a GitHub master for
- [15:00] this. Claude will handle it all for you.
- [15:02] Perfect. It has been committed and
- [15:03] pushed. Let's refresh and see if we have
- [15:05] our code here. Boom. Our code's on
- [15:07] GitHub. That is awesome. You're now
- [15:09] basically a full-time software
- [15:11] developer. Congratulations. This also
- [15:13] backs up your code. So if you ever mess
- [15:15] up and you write code or something you
- [15:16] don't like, you can just pull it back
- [15:18] down from GitHub and you are good to go.
- [15:20] This keeps your code safe. If your
- [15:23] computer ever blows up or burns out, you
- [15:25] have your code on the web now as a
- [15:26] backup, which is awesome. Now we can do
- [15:28] this. If we switch over to Claude for
- [15:31] web and basically all you need to do is
- [15:32] go to claude.ai, then hit code in the
- [15:35] lefth hand bar. This will open up claude
- [15:37] code for web which you see here. We can
- [15:39] select our repositories by typing
- [15:41] project management app. There it is.
- [15:44] Boom. We are connected. We are now
- [15:47] connected to our app from the cloud. And
- [15:50] now we can spin up agents from cloud
- [15:52] code web to start working on our app for
- [15:55] us. But here's where the workflow gets
- [15:57] interesting. I'm not only going to spin
- [15:59] up coding agents. You think cloud code,
- [16:01] you think, oh, you're going to use the
- [16:02] agents for coding. No, no, no, no, no.
- [16:04] This is a this is just a general web
- [16:07] agent. So we can have this AI agent do
- [16:09] anything we want on the web. So let's do
- [16:11] this. We're not even going to have it
- [16:12] start coding yet. We're going to go in
- [16:13] here and we're going to do this. So I'm
- [16:14] going to say this. Please build me out a
- [16:16] road map for this app. Look at all the
- [16:18] code in our project management app. Then
- [16:20] build us a road map of features that
- [16:22] will make our app better, make customers
- [16:24] stickier, and overall improve the value
- [16:27] of the app. I'm going to hit enter on
- [16:29] that. And what that is going to do is
- [16:32] now spin us up an AI agent in the cloud.
- [16:34] I can hit enable. So, it's going to
- [16:36] alert us when it is done working. And
- [16:39] now Claude on the web. This is an AI
- [16:41] agent on the web. This isn't even on my
- [16:42] computer. Is now building out a
- [16:44] comprehensive roadmap. But let's go
- [16:46] back. It's going to go to work. Let's
- [16:47] spin up some more AI. We're going to
- [16:48] have a work. We're going to have an army
- [16:50] of AI agents working for us here. I also
- [16:52] want a marketing AI agent. So, I'm going
- [16:54] to say this. You are a marketing agent.
- [16:57] Please look at our app and come up with
- [16:59] a marketing plan, including tweets and
- [17:00] emails. Also, build us out a landing
- [17:02] page copy and design. I'm going to hit
- [17:04] enter on that. Now we have two AI agents
- [17:07] on the web workers. While we have one AI
- [17:08] agent inside claude code here to the
- [17:10] right building our app, we now have two
- [17:12] agents on the web building for us. But
- [17:14] that we're not done here. Let's keep
- [17:15] going. So I'm looking at our project
- [17:17] management here. We have build the base
- [17:19] application. That's done. We'll move
- [17:20] that to finish. Let's have an AI agent
- [17:23] customize the look and feel. So we'll
- [17:25] put that in progress. Let's go back here
- [17:27] and let's say build a light mode and
- [17:29] dark mode for our app. And we're going
- [17:32] to hit enter on that. And so now we have
- [17:34] an actual AI agent coding for us. And
- [17:36] now it's building out the light mode and
- [17:38] the dark mode for us on the web. And
- [17:40] I'll show you in a little bit how to
- [17:41] pull down this code and put it in our
- [17:43] app. So we have three AI agents chugging
- [17:45] along for us on the web. If we were
- [17:47] about to go to bed, you can go on your
- [17:50] app on your phone and actually have your
- [17:52] agents build. I don't think you can see
- [17:54] it here, but I actually have the agents
- [17:56] on my phone right here in the Claw Code
- [17:58] app. There you can see it. You just go
- [18:00] into the claude app and then you click
- [18:01] code on the lefth hand side and you can
- [18:03] see your agents. So this is
- [18:04] crossplatform. This is on my phone, on
- [18:05] my computer, everything. So this is
- [18:07] really sick. But let's do this while
- [18:08] this is in progress with our AI agents.
- [18:11] Let's add some AI function. So let's
- [18:13] generate AI prompts in each card. So I
- [18:15] want to make it so that each card in our
- [18:17] app, you can look at a task and when you
- [18:19] click it, you can actually have it
- [18:21] generate an AI prompt for you that you
- [18:23] can put into Claude Code and have it
- [18:25] build out. I think that would be really
- [18:27] sick. So let's build that out inside
- [18:28] cloud code. So this is part of the
- [18:31] general workflow which superpowers you,
- [18:33] right? You're spinning up agents to work
- [18:35] on the cloud for you that are building
- [18:36] out a whole bunch of functionality, your
- [18:38] marketing, your road map, your product
- [18:41] manager. You're basically have a
- [18:42] oneperson company going on here, right?
- [18:45] And then at the same time, we're going
- [18:46] to go in and we're going to start
- [18:48] building out features ourself. This is
- [18:51] how a oneperson business turns into a
- [18:54] billiondoll business. This was not
- [18:56] possible before AI. Right? Before AI, if
- [18:58] I wanted to build this app, I'd have to
- [19:00] hire a product person, a marketing
- [19:01] person. I'd have to hire developers. I'd
- [19:04] be spending millions of dollars a year
- [19:06] to build this out. Now, because of AI, I
- [19:09] have my three employees working for me
- [19:11] in the cloud. My product manager, my
- [19:12] marketer, my junior developer, and then
- [19:15] I have my senior developer over here
- [19:17] inside Cloud Code building out the other
- [19:19] features for me. This is why I said this
- [19:21] workflow is so powerful is because this
- [19:23] is how you build leverage. This is how
- [19:25] you build an entire company that works
- [19:28] for you even though you're just one
- [19:30] person. Many people would spend millions
- [19:32] of dollars a year to have all these
- [19:34] people working for them in a company.
- [19:35] For me, I'm spending $20 a month for
- [19:38] claw code. Pretty incredible. So, let's
- [19:40] go in and start building out the AI
- [19:42] functionality here. I'm going to show
- [19:43] you how to implement an AI API into your
- [19:46] app as well. So, you can have AI
- [19:47] functionality in your app. This is your
- [19:49] first time doing this, you're going to
- [19:50] be so ahead of your competitors. It's
- [19:52] crazy. So, I'm going to hit shift tab to
- [19:54] go into plan mode. And this is the
- [19:55] prompt. I'll put this down below as
- [19:56] well. I want to make it so there is AI
- [19:58] functionality in this app. I'd like to
- [20:00] make it so that in each card on the
- [20:02] Cananband board, there is an AI button.
- [20:05] Then, when I hit that button, it uses
- [20:07] the Open AI API to generate a prompt for
- [20:10] that card. It will take the title of the
- [20:12] card and turn it into a prompt I can
- [20:14] give to Claude Code to build out that
- [20:15] feature. So, basically, you have your
- [20:17] board. There's now going to be an AI
- [20:19] button. I click it and it will take
- [20:21] whatever the task is in that card and
- [20:23] turn it into an AI prompt that I then
- [20:26] can give to Claude code to build out
- [20:27] whatever that feature is. That's really
- [20:29] awesome AI functionality that we're
- [20:31] about to build out here. So, I'm going
- [20:32] to do this in plan mode. I'm going to
- [20:34] hit send. And this is going to plan out
- [20:36] again using Sonnet how to build out this
- [20:38] feature. So, we're saving money because
- [20:40] Haiku is doing all the building. Sonnet
- [20:42] is doing all the planning. A really cool
- [20:44] workflow tip that's going to save you a
- [20:46] ton of money as this is building. By the
- [20:47] way, if you learned anything at all, all
- [20:49] my videos are jam-packed with as just
- [20:51] much value as this. So, make sure you
- [20:53] leave a like if you learned anything.
- [20:55] Subscribe for way more content like
- [20:57] this. Turn on notifications so you get
- [20:59] alert the moment I live stream or build
- [21:01] things out. I promise it will be worth
- [21:03] it. So, this is the plan. It's built
- [21:05] out. I'll help you build out the AI
- [21:07] functionality. This is awesome. I love
- [21:08] when Claude does this. It is asking me
- [21:10] for my preferences. So, instead of just
- [21:12] building out the plan, it's like, "Okay,
- [21:13] so what do you want to use? Which models
- [21:15] do you want to use? What do you want it
- [21:16] to look like? I like the does. So, we'll
- [21:18] go in. We're going to answer these
- [21:19] questions. I'm going to say use GBT5.
- [21:22] It's asking how in-depth I want the
- [21:25] prompts to be. Keep the prompting
- [21:27] simple, not super technical. Then, it's
- [21:31] asking me where should the prompt be
- [21:33] displayed. I'm going to say append the
- [21:35] description field. Card context. Uh, do
- [21:38] we want to include everything in the
- [21:39] card for context? Include everything in
- [21:42] the card for context. an API
- [21:45] implementation. This is a client side
- [21:46] app with no backend. Are you okay with
- [21:48] creating a Nex.js API route? Yes,
- [21:50] whatever you think is appropriate and
- [21:54] simple. If you notice, there is a ton of
- [21:57] spelling mistakes in everything I'm
- [21:58] typing, but that's okay. Claude
- [22:00] understands what I'm saying. So, it is
- [22:01] what it is. That's show business, baby.
- [22:03] All right. We're going to hit enter
- [22:04] there, and it is going to start getting
- [22:06] to work. At the same time, we're going
- [22:08] to check in on our AI agents over here.
- [22:11] It looks like one of them is done.
- [22:12] Create app road map from existing code.
- [22:14] Let's let's see the road map it came up
- [22:16] for us. All right. So, we're going to go
- [22:17] up here. Let's see here. Oh, it did a
- [22:19] lot of work for us. Excellent. We now
- [22:21] have a complete understanding. And here
- [22:22] is the road map. I've analyzed your
- [22:24] entire codebase and created a detailed
- [22:26] road map for you. So, it tells us the
- [22:28] current state and now it gives us phases
- [22:30] for all of 2025. So, the backend
- [22:33] structure, it's going to give us
- [22:34] database road map. That's pretty sick.
- [22:36] It's going to tell us off and user
- [22:37] management. It has a roadmap for us for
- [22:39] team management and workspaces, being
- [22:41] able to add comments, a notification
- [22:42] system, being able to attach files.
- [22:44] These are really good ideas. What I like
- [22:46] to do as we do this here, and I'm going
- [22:48] to accept the plan over on the right.
- [22:50] See, I'm multitasking out the wazoo
- [22:52] here. I'm going to pull open tick tick
- [22:54] again over here. Again, just use Apple
- [22:56] Notes if you want. And I'm just going to
- [22:58] add some of the ideas I see from the AI
- [23:00] over here. Um, so I like the ability to
- [23:02] add notes.
- [23:05] Team management. Let's add team
- [23:06] management here. Uh notification system.
- [23:09] I like that. Sync to your calendar. So,
- [23:12] let's sync with calendar. And basically
- [23:14] what we're doing is we're generating
- [23:16] ideas with the AI. We're putting it in
- [23:18] our project management tool. And we're
- [23:20] just humming here. The app's improving.
- [23:22] Your competition, I promise you, is not
- [23:25] using this workflow. Your competition
- [23:27] isn't generating ideas. I mean, what are
- [23:29] we what like 10 minutes in here? We're
- [23:30] generating ideas. We already have the
- [23:32] app done. We're moving on to the road
- [23:34] map. We have a hundred different ideas
- [23:36] good to go and we're all just one
- [23:38] person. That's why this workflow is so
- [23:41] powerful because you have the leverage
- [23:43] of 20 different people at once even
- [23:45] though you're just one person and you're
- [23:47] organized. So if we come back to this
- [23:48] later, we have our system good to go.
- [23:51] What your competition is doing is
- [23:53] they're using cloud code. They're giving
- [23:55] it prompts of things to build out and
- [23:56] then as it's building they're going on
- [23:58] their phone and they're doom scrolling
- [23:59] Tik Tok and their brain is melting out
- [24:01] of their ears. You you're different.
- [24:03] Instead of your brain melting out of
- [24:05] your ears on Tik Tok, you're coming in
- [24:07] here and you're hiring hundreds of AI
- [24:09] employees to work for you to come up
- [24:12] with road maps, marketing, building your
- [24:14] landing page, build out your app, all
- [24:16] the above. While your competition
- [24:19] snoozes and rots away, you are using
- [24:22] leverage and building faster than you
- [24:24] ever have in your entire life. So,
- [24:26] that's still building. I'll layer on one
- [24:28] more feature for you here while this
- [24:29] goes. So this is only if you want to
- [24:32] take this workflow to the next level.
- [24:34] This is only if you want to be maximum
- [24:38] efficient. I also have the clawed
- [24:41] desktop app open at all times. If you
- [24:44] want to use the chat GBT desktop app,
- [24:46] you can do that. If you want to use the
- [24:47] Google Gemini desktop app, if you even
- [24:49] have one, you can do that. This is for
- [24:51] general back and forth brainstorming and
- [24:54] talking to the AI. And so what I'll do
- [24:56] here is I will describe to Claude what
- [24:58] I'm building. I like to use this prompt
- [25:00] whenever I'm starting to build out a new
- [25:01] project. I'm building out a project
- [25:03] management canband board app right now.
- [25:05] I want to use this chat to be generally
- [25:07] productive and talk about what I'm
- [25:09] building. Come up with new ideas and
- [25:10] just get general advice for my business
- [25:12] and life. Let's chat. And I'm going to
- [25:14] hit enter on that. And now while we have
- [25:17] agents working for us on Claude for
- [25:19] Webb, while we have our agent building
- [25:21] out functionality inside Claude Code, I
- [25:24] now have like a general business and
- [25:27] life consultant. I'll be talking to in
- [25:30] the claw desktop app. And so you don't
- [25:32] even need to just talk about the app
- [25:34] you're working on, the cananban board. A
- [25:36] lot of the times I'll use this to talk
- [25:38] about things in my life. Hey, I want to
- [25:39] be more productive. I want to read more
- [25:41] books. How do I do that? How do I find
- [25:43] more time to read more books? And this
- [25:45] will go through that with me. And this
- [25:47] is how you stay maximally productive.
- [25:50] Right? Most people when using AI,
- [25:52] there's tons of downtime. They're doom
- [25:54] scrolling. They're getting distracted by
- [25:55] Twitter, by YouTube, by Tik Tok,
- [25:57] whatever. while it's working. The key to
- [25:59] getting maximum productivity in your
- [26:02] workflow is maximizing your leverage
- [26:05] with AI and avoiding downtime. As long
- [26:08] as you use AI whenever you have
- [26:10] downtime, you will constantly constantly
- [26:13] be productive and be getting better. And
- [26:16] so I have my AI and Claude code building
- [26:18] out the big tasks. I have my AI agents
- [26:22] inside Claude for web doing the little
- [26:24] tasks and the little planning. And then
- [26:27] I have the clawed desktop app I use for
- [26:29] business consulting, general back and
- [26:31] forth, and making sure I get the most
- [26:33] out of every second I'm working with the
- [26:36] AI. Your competition at best is just
- [26:39] building with Claude and then getting
- [26:41] distracted and running off whenever it's
- [26:42] building. You on the other hand, an
- [26:44] absolute savage, an absolute master who
- [26:47] is maximizing every second to squeeze
- [26:50] the juice out of AI, is again using
- [26:53] Claude to build out the main features.
- [26:55] Yes. Yes and don't ask again using
- [26:57] Claude for web their brand new feature
- [27:00] to have agents go build their road map
- [27:02] build out little tasks like for instance
- [27:05] the light and dark mode which is already
- [27:07] done and then they have their business
- [27:09] consultant to do higher level planning
- [27:12] on the app higher level administration
- [27:14] higher level life management to get the
- [27:17] most out of AI and now your workflow is
- [27:20] humming there's two things we're doing
- [27:22] here we're eliminating distractions
- [27:24] which is critical we live live in an add
- [27:26] society where everyone is constantly
- [27:28] distracted. We are eliminating
- [27:30] distractions and we are maximizing the
- [27:32] output from the AI agents. So let's do
- [27:35] this. Let's see how this workflow went.
- [27:37] Let's add our AI key, test out this new
- [27:40] functionality we just built out and see
- [27:42] how it did. So it looks like it used the
- [27:43] anthropic API for this. I guess it sees
- [27:45] we're in an anthropic mood. So we use
- [27:47] the anthropic API key. I'll show you how
- [27:49] to grab that right now. If you sign in
- [27:50] at console.anthropic.com,
- [27:52] you can get your API key from here. I'm
- [27:54] going to click get get API key. I'm
- [27:56] going to click create a key. I'm going
- [27:58] to say project management and I'm going
- [28:01] to hit add. Copy your API key
- [28:03] into.env.local.
- [28:05] Right there you hit save and your AI
- [28:08] functionality should be good to go. All
- [28:09] right. So, let's test this out. It looks
- [28:11] like we have this nice new AI button on
- [28:14] every single card here. If we click it,
- [28:17] I imagine it's going to generate an AI
- [28:18] prompt for us. Let's we click. I like
- [28:20] that little nice animation there. That
- [28:21] was smarter claw dad. Boom. AI generated
- [28:24] prompts add local storage function to
- [28:26] automatically save and persist. So now
- [28:27] we don't need to think of AI prompts
- [28:29] anymore for each one of the features. We
- [28:31] can just copy and paste the prompt that
- [28:34] the AI gives us and give it to Cloud
- [28:35] Code and it will build the functionality
- [28:37] out for us. We built that out. The app
- [28:40] is looking pretty good. I mean you have
- [28:42] all the functionality we need to manage
- [28:44] your apps. Now instead of using tick
- [28:45] tick to plan out our apps that we vibe
- [28:47] code, we can use our own app that we
- [28:50] built ourselves. And there's nothing
- [28:51] cooler than that. There's nothing cooler
- [28:53] than than using the apps you built
- [28:56] yourself. It is the best feeling in the
- [28:58] world. So, let's recap what we did so
- [29:00] far. For this workflow, we used the
- [29:02] Claude Code extension inside of VS Code,
- [29:06] which I think is the best way to
- [29:08] interface with Claude Code in the world.
- [29:10] Clean, simple, easy to use. We use
- [29:12] Claude for Web, their brand new
- [29:14] functionality at claude.ai AI that
- [29:17] allowed us to spin up as many AI agents
- [29:19] in the cloud that we want in order to
- [29:21] get things done like building little
- [29:23] tiny features like doing research for
- [29:26] our app like doing marketing basically
- [29:28] we keep spinning up employees for
- [29:30] ourselves to do work for us. Then we use
- [29:33] the clawed desktop app to be like our
- [29:36] business consultant. So as things are
- [29:38] working, as code is generating for us,
- [29:40] we talk to the clawed desktop app to
- [29:43] bounce ideas, talk about our life, talk
- [29:45] about the business, just get advice so
- [29:47] that we don't waste time. While everyone
- [29:49] else, while our competition goes and
- [29:51] doom scrolls Tik Tok while the AI is
- [29:54] building and it takes them 12 hours to
- [29:55] get anything done, we are chugging
- [29:57] along. We are spinning up AI agents. We
- [30:00] are talking to business consultants.
- [30:02] We're having 20 AIs work for us at the
- [30:04] same time. This is the best workflow you
- [30:07] possibly can have for vibe coding right
- [30:10] now. This will get apps out faster than
- [30:12] you possibly can imagine. Everything
- [30:13] else is just noises. People, oh, you
- [30:15] have to do MCPS and NAN and this and
- [30:17] that. And no, no, no, no. You keep it
- [30:19] simple like we did today and you will
- [30:21] get way more work done than you possibly
- [30:24] can imagine. If you learned anything at
- [30:26] all, leave a like. Let me know in the
