## Text

- [00:00] - I think there's also a
lot of interesting things
- [00:01] to explore of multi-agent as
a form of test time compute.
- [00:05] - Basically letting Claude,
- [00:08] many Claudes work on a
problem can be, you know,
- [00:11] get you a better final
answer than just one.
- [00:18] - Hey, I'm Alex, I lead Claude
Relations here at Anthropic.
- [00:21] Today we're gonna be talking about
- [00:22] building more effective agents
- [00:24] and I'm joined by my colleague.
- [00:25] - I'm Erik, I work on multi-agent research
- [00:27] here at Anthropic.
- [00:28] - Erik, to kick us off here,
- [00:30] can you just explain why Claude
is so good at agent tasks?
- [00:33] - Yeah, sure.
- [00:34] So during our training,
- [00:35] we let Claude practice being an agent.
- [00:38] We give it open-ended
problems for it to work on
- [00:41] where it can take many steps
- [00:43] and use tools, explore where
it is and what it's working on
- [00:47] before giving a final answer.
- [00:49] And by getting lots of
practice at being an agent,
- [00:51] Claude becomes really good at this.
- [00:53] - Okay, so it's these long running tasks
- [00:54] and a variety of domains basically.
- [00:57] And through the process of RL
- [01:00] and other training mechanisms,
- [01:01] Claude is learning an objective
of how to do these things
- [01:04] with basically limited
guidance or feedback.
- [01:07] - Exactly, we do lots
of RL on coding tasks,
- [01:10] on search tasks, lots of things for Claude
- [01:12] to practice being an agent
in different environments.
- [01:15] - There's kind of this conception,
I think of Claude models
- [01:17] that they're really,
really strong in code,
- [01:20] but that doesn't always maybe
transfer into other domains
- [01:22] or that coding is its own separate thing.
- [01:24] What are your kind of
views on that generally?
- [01:26] - So coding has been the first task
- [01:28] that we've really focused on,
- [01:30] but once you have an amazing coding agent,
- [01:32] a coding agent can do
any other kind of work.
- [01:34] - If you need to do search,
you can do web search,
- [01:38] you know, via APIs, you
can plan a weekend by,
- [01:42] you know, creating a schedule.
- [01:44] So we really see coding as
a very fundamental skill
- [01:48] for an agent that's gonna have
a lot of spillover effect,
- [01:50] to be able to make Claude
great at all sorts of things
- [01:53] and sort of like train on
the hardest thing first
- [01:56] and then everything else will become easy.
- [01:57] - One interesting thing
I've seen here recently
- [02:00] with a feature that we released
in Claude AI on the web
- [02:04] was the ability for Claude
to create actual files
- [02:08] through writing code.
- [02:09] So it was like writing a Python script
- [02:11] and then the Python script got ran
- [02:13] and all of a sudden you
have like a Excel sheet
- [02:15] that popped out of that.
- [02:17] Is that kind of the future
direction that we're headed
- [02:18] is like Claude's writing scripts
- [02:20] and taking actions on
computers to create files
- [02:23] or do things that are
traditionally not code related?
- [02:26] - I think that's one of
the really effective ways
- [02:28] Claude will be able to do these things.
- [02:30] Actually, just a few days
ago Claude was helping me
- [02:32] make some diagrams for a presentation
- [02:34] and it was able to create files
- [02:36] just by writing out the SVGs,
- [02:38] but then I wanted it to make
a much more detailed diagram
- [02:41] that would need a lot of repetition
- [02:43] and so Claude was actually able to do this
- [02:45] by writing some code to generate the SVG,
- [02:48] which ran much, much
faster than Claude itself
- [02:50] needing to write you know,
- [02:51] it was a very, very repetitive image file
- [02:54] with lots and lots of sort
of detailed patterns in it.
- [02:56] - Yeah.
- So, yeah,
- [02:57] I think that for a lot
of cases writing code
- [03:00] to produce some artifact
will be much better
- [03:03] than just trying to create
that artifact directly.
- [03:05] So it's one way to do it for harder cases.
- [03:07] - Okay, right, yeah.
- [03:08] Code allows for kind of this speed up
- [03:11] that's not even possible with
like a human like clicking
- [03:13] and dragging and using
their mouse on a computer.
- [03:16] Like repeated actions.
- [03:17] - Exactly, Claude gets a for loop.
- [03:18] - Yeah, if you're a developer
- [03:21] and you're building an agent with Claude,
- [03:23] one thing that we've started
to see become really popular
- [03:25] is this Claude Code SDK.
- [03:26] Can you walk me through what that is
- [03:28] and how you're seeing
developers starting to use that?
- [03:30] - Yeah, so we're really
excited about developers
- [03:32] using the Claude Code SDK.
- [03:34] This is something where
previously if you wanted
- [03:37] to build a coding agent
or sort of any agent,
- [03:40] you had to really go from
- [03:42] nothing but hitting an API endpoint,
- [03:45] build the loops yourself,
build all the tools,
- [03:48] build executing these tools,
- [03:50] interacting with files,
interacting with MCP.
- [03:53] We basically have already built
all of that into Claude Code
- [03:56] and even though its name is Claude Code,
- [03:58] really Claude Code is just
a general purpose agent
- [04:01] that is most often used for code.
- [04:03] Yeah, we are encouraging a lot
of developers to use this SDK
- [04:06] as the core of their agent loop
- [04:08] and that way they don't
have to spend a lot of time
- [04:11] reinventing the wheel that
we've already put a lot of time
- [04:14] into polishing and perfecting
that core agent loop
- [04:17] and instead they can use that
- [04:19] and then just add their tools
- [04:21] for their own custom business logic
- [04:23] or affordances into that via MCP.
- [04:25] - Right, so it offers that
sort of customizability
- [04:28] to where you can remove
the coding-specific bits.
- [04:30] - Exactly.
- And put in
- [04:31] whatever sort of prompt
or tools that you need,
- [04:34] just like slots nicely into the scaffold.
- [04:36] - Yeah, I think also the people
- [04:37] have been using Claude Code
for all sorts of things.
- [04:39] I think the, my strangest
use of Claude Code
- [04:42] is I once had it plan a date for me
- [04:44] where I did a bunch of web searches,
- [04:46] found interesting activities
and restaurants in the area
- [04:48] and so not code related at
all, but it has all the tools.
- [04:51] - How was the date?
- [04:52] - It was pretty good.
- [04:53] It was great, yeah.
- Claude did a good job?
- [04:55] - Yeah, Filoli Gardens
- [04:56] and then a Chinese restaurant nearby.
- [04:57] - Wow, okay.
- Claude did a good job.
- [04:59] - I'm impressed.
- Yeah.
- [05:00] One other thing on Claude Code
- [05:01] that has been another popular feature
- [05:05] I've seen a lot of software
engineers use lately
- [05:07] is Claude MD files.
- [05:08] So these are files that you, you know,
- [05:11] define within a project
- [05:12] and gives Claude relevant
information about
- [05:14] what your programming style is
- [05:16] or like what the layout
of the directories are,
- [05:18] things like that.
- [05:19] We've now launched a similar concept
- [05:21] that maybe takes a step
further called Skills.
- [05:23] Can you explain what Skills are
- [05:25] and how we're starting to
see developers use them
- [05:27] and what they mean for Agents?
- [05:29] - Yeah, so Claude Skills are
a very exciting extension
- [05:32] of Claude MD files where
instead of just giving it
- [05:36] notes files, you can
give it any sort of file.
- [05:39] That can be PowerPoint
template files, it can be code
- [05:43] and like helper scripts
that you want it to use.
- [05:46] It can be images or assets.
- [05:49] And I think this extension
of not just instructions
- [05:51] but resources for the agent to use
- [05:54] is a really, really powerful
tool where you might say,
- [05:57] not just these in are my instructions
- [05:59] for making PowerPoint
presentations, but here's, you know,
- [06:02] the head shots of all of
our company leadership
- [06:04] that you might need to
reuse in many presentations
- [06:06] and just giving it all to
Claude in a reusable way.
- [06:08] So it has everything it needs right there.
- [06:10] - One analogy I've heard used internally
- [06:13] that I really, really like is,
- [06:14] it's kind of like in "The Matrix"
- [06:16] when Neo is learning kung
fu for the first time
- [06:19] and they like inject him
with the Kung Fu information
- [06:22] and all of a sudden he
is like a Kung Fu master.
- [06:24] That feels like very similar
to when I give Claude a skill
- [06:27] of some type of like, here's
how you create spreadsheets.
- [06:29] And it's like, oh, all of a sudden
- [06:30] Claude's like a banker now
- [06:32] and it can create a
financial model for me.
- [06:34] - That and where they load in
all of the racks of equipment
- [06:37] and tools and stuff for them to grab.
- [06:38] - Yes.
- It's like, you know,
- [06:39] you can start with these
things, not just instructions.
- [06:41] - Yeah, I love that.
- [06:42] Switching gears a little bit,
- [06:43] so last time we chatted on
camera here a few months back
- [06:48] and we were talking about Agents
- [06:49] and at the time we were in this transition
- [06:51] from maybe workflows which
are like very defined ways
- [06:55] of how you chain together prompts
- [06:57] to what was just like
a single agent system
- [07:00] where you're running a model in a loop.
- [07:02] Since then, what's been
the evolution in the space?
- [07:05] - Yeah, so we've really seen
Agents take over from workflows
- [07:08] where Claude has gotten so
good at responding to feedback
- [07:12] and correcting its own work
- [07:14] that now Agent loops really
dramatically outperform
- [07:18] workflows for most things
where you care most about
- [07:22] absolute quality.
- [07:23] Workflows are still great,
- [07:24] where you need very low latency
- [07:25] and you want Claude to just
give a best answer, single shot.
- [07:28] Agents are really, really
high performance now.
- [07:32] I think one of the things that
I've seen develop since then
- [07:35] is what I call workflows of Agents.
- [07:38] Whereas previously an
application might have had
- [07:40] a workflow that had Claude in single shot
- [07:43] write a SQL command in order to load data
- [07:45] and then that would go to
another step in the workflow
- [07:48] where it would then write a
chart to display that data.
- [07:52] And if the SQL command
failed, you know this,
- [07:56] it doesn't know that it's
not returning any data
- [07:58] and then the second step of the workflow--
- [07:59] - Right.
- Is kind of screwed.
- [08:01] - Completely falls apart.
- [08:02] - But now I've seen people
where each one of those steps
- [08:04] in the workflow is actually a closed loop
- [08:06] where instead of just
writing a single attempt
- [08:09] at a SQL query, it then
runs, Claude sees the output
- [08:13] and then it can keep iterating and repeat
- [08:14] until it knows that it got the right value
- [08:16] and then it transitions to
the next step in the workflow.
- [08:19] - Okay, interesting.
- [08:20] So yes, this evolution I guess
- [08:24] of like chaining together prompts
- [08:26] to now chaining together
agents in these loops themself,
- [08:29] we'll see where that goes from there.
- [08:31] One other big topic of discussion,
- [08:33] I feel like that has taken a
lot more chatter as of late
- [08:37] is this question around
observability and verification.
- [08:42] Can you explain what that challenge is
- [08:44] and how people are
starting to think about it?
- [08:46] - Yeah, so observability
is very hard for Agents,
- [08:49] especially as the systems get more complex
- [08:51] and I think that's one of the reasons
- [08:53] where I still really believe
- [08:54] that even though the models
are much more capable today
- [08:58] than they were a year ago
and they can work better
- [09:01] in an agent or even more complex setups,
- [09:03] I think that simplicity is
still a really important thing
- [09:06] and that even though you can
build a big workflow of agents,
- [09:10] you should still start sort of by
- [09:12] from the simplest possible thing
- [09:13] and then work up to a
more complex solution.
- [09:17] And you know, that's first
trying single shotting things
- [09:19] or trying, you know, single
shot prompt to Claude Code SDK,
- [09:23] which is now just sort of such
a simple, easy thing to use.
- [09:27] And then I think only
as needed adding layers
- [09:30] and layers of complexity
- [09:31] because that's gonna make
the absorbability harder.
- [09:33] - Another term here maybe
in parallel to workflows
- [09:36] of agents is multi-agent,
is that the same thing
- [09:39] or is that something different?
- [09:40] - Yeah, so multi-agent is my
main area of research now.
- [09:44] I'd say it's pretty different
from a workflow of agent.
- [09:46] - Okay.
- Workflows of agents,
- [09:48] where sort of an one agent goes,
- [09:50] finishes and then it transitions
- [09:52] or its output gets sent to
the next agent to work on.
- [09:56] Multi-agent is where fundamentally
you have multiple agents
- [09:59] or multiple Claudes
working at the same time
- [10:02] where maybe one parent
agent delegates tasks
- [10:07] to five sub-agents that can
each then work in parallel.
- [10:10] And this is how our deep research
- [10:12] search product works is
the main orchestrator agent
- [10:16] will decide and create several sub-agents.
- [10:18] They can do lots of searches in parallel
- [10:20] and that's way better for the user
- [10:22] because you know, all
this happens in parallel
- [10:24] and you get the answer back much sooner.
- [10:27] We also see things like in Claude Code
- [10:30] the model will use a subagent.
- [10:31] So if something, if some
sub-task is gonna take
- [10:34] tens of thousands of tokens,
- [10:36] like maybe finding a certain
implementation of a class,
- [10:39] but the answer really boils
down to something very small,
- [10:42] it can do that work in a sub-agent
- [10:44] to protect the main
context from all of that,
- [10:48] those tokens that aren't
necessary for the main work.
- [10:50] So yeah, basically can
offload this piece of work
- [10:53] and just get back the
final answer that it needs.
- [10:56] - So are we exposing then
this subagent in this case
- [10:59] is like a tool that Claude can call upon?
- [11:02] - Exactly.
- Pass in,
- [11:03] it'll pass in the prompt
- [11:04] as like a parameter or something?
- [11:05] - Exactly, yeah.
- [11:06] So to the, to Claude
sub-agents look like a tool
- [11:09] where it can pass
prompts to the sub-agents
- [11:12] that will then go and do work.
- [11:13] And part of my research is training Claude
- [11:15] to be a better manager and know how to--
- [11:17] - Oh interesting.
- Give clear instructions
- [11:19] to its sub-agents and make sure
- [11:20] that they gets the right things
- [11:21] and needs out of them.
- [11:22] - How is this different than,
- [11:23] or is this maybe like a specialized part
- [11:25] of tool calling overall or
is it different in some ways?
- [11:28] - I would say that this uses
the framework of tool calling
- [11:31] for that communication protocol
- [11:35] and it just happens to
be a tool that itself
- [11:37] is backed by Claude, by another Claude.
- [11:39] - Does Claude have like
an intuitive understanding
- [11:40] of what a subagent is or do
we have to like teach it?
- [11:43] Like you're actually
talking to another version
- [11:45] of yourself, Claude,
- [11:47] like don't get freaked out sort of thing?
- [11:49] - I would say that Claude makes
a lot of the same mistakes
- [11:53] that first time managers make
- [11:55] of where it will give incomplete
- [11:57] or sort of unclear instructions.
- [11:58] - Right, right.
- To a sub-agent.
- [12:00] - Right.
- And you know,
- [12:01] kind of expect the subagent
- [12:03] to have the right context
when actually it doesn't.
- [12:05] And I think something we've seen
- [12:07] during training on
sub-agents is that Claude
- [12:10] starts to get much more
verbose and much more detailed
- [12:12] and give its subagent the overall context
- [12:15] of what's going on.
- Interesting.
- [12:16] - So that they can do better work
- [12:17] that adds them to the whole, so.
- [12:19] I'd say that, you know,
it definitely Claude,
- [12:23] Claude has a lot to learn
- [12:24] and is learning to get better at this.
- [12:25] - Okay, cool.
- Yeah.
- [12:27] - What are, what are some
of the use cases here?
- [12:29] So their search is one in
like preserving context,
- [12:32] is there other things
- [12:33] that people are using
multi-agent for right now?
- [12:35] - Yeah, I think coding is,
- [12:37] there's a lot of subagent use in coding.
- [12:40] Anything that can be
parallelized or MapReduced.
- [12:43] If you have something
where you need to produce
- [12:45] a lot of output or there's maybe 10 parts
- [12:48] of some output you're creating,
- [12:50] if you can split that
up among 10 sub-agents,
- [12:53] that can be really, really
effective for saving context
- [12:56] and getting faster results.
- [12:58] I think there's also a lot of
interesting things to explore
- [13:00] of multi-agent as a form
of test time compute.
- [13:04] - Basically letting Claude,
- [13:06] many Claudes work on a
problem can be, you know,
- [13:09] get you a better final
answer than just one.
- [13:11] Just like with people, you know,
- [13:12] a bunch of people putting
their heads together
- [13:14] can get better results.
- [13:15] - In that case, are we specializing
these agents in any way?
- [13:19] Do we gear them towards like
one type of persona or another,
- [13:22] or is it just kind of let
them take whatever form?
- [13:25] - I think you can do either.
- [13:27] You know, sometimes it's helpful
to give a bunch of people
- [13:29] the same exact task and see
- [13:31] what the different answers
they come up with are.
- [13:33] Sometimes it's good to have many people
- [13:34] or many agents work from
different approaches
- [13:36] to the same problem or split it up.
- [13:39] One thing I've seen a lot is customers
- [13:42] that have a lot of tools,
maybe 100 or 200 tools
- [13:45] that they want an agent to use,
- [13:47] they found that it's
really good to split up
- [13:49] those tools among sub-agents.
- [13:51] So the main agent, all
it has to know is hey,
- [13:53] I want to use this bucket of tools
- [13:56] and then there's a subagent that goes
- [13:57] and does the actual work there.
- [13:59] So that each subagent
just has maybe 20 tools
- [14:02] that it needs to understand
and know how to use.
- [14:04] - Have we tried like scaling
agents like all the way up?
- [14:07] Like what happens if you
have like a thousand versions
- [14:09] of Claude all working on one problem?
- [14:11] Does it just turn into chaos?
- [14:13] - I've not tried that yet.
- Okay.
- [14:14] - But I'll get back to you.
- [14:15] - Good research idea right there.
- [14:17] What are some of other like failure modes
- [14:19] that we're seeing right now
with agents or multi-agents?
- [14:22] - Yeah, I think just like
any sort of complex system,
- [14:26] I think it's easy to overbuild something
- [14:28] and lose a lot of efficiency
- [14:29] and just create sort of a
lot of like dead weight.
- [14:32] And so I've seen overbuilt
multi-agent systems
- [14:35] spend too much time just
talking back and forth
- [14:38] with each other and not
actually making progress
- [14:40] on the main task, and you know,
- [14:42] human agents or human
organizations suffer from the stew.
- [14:45] As companies get bigger,
- [14:47] you have more communication
overhead and you know,
- [14:49] less and less work is actually, you know,
- [14:51] the people on the ground
making progress on things.
- [14:54] - And so I think that's another
interesting thing to study
- [14:56] is like how can we make
organizations of Claudes
- [15:00] very effective while
keeping the overhead small?
- [15:03] - If I'm a developer and I want
to get started with agents,
- [15:06] whether I'm building
on the Claude Code SDK
- [15:08] or just trying to on my
own, do you have any tips
- [15:10] or best practices that you'd give them?
- [15:12] - Yeah, I think the best
practices really remain
- [15:15] start simple and make sure, you know,
- [15:17] you only add complexities you need.
- [15:19] I think another really important thing
- [15:21] is think from the point
of view of your agents.
- [15:24] If you are giving Claude tools or prompts
- [15:27] or sort of any affordances,
put yourself in Claude's shoes
- [15:31] and read what it actually
gets, what it sees as the model
- [15:35] and make sure there's actually
enough information there
- [15:37] for you to solve the problem.
- [15:39] It's very easy to sort
of forget, you know,
- [15:42] that we're seeing everything
- [15:43] and the model only sees what we showed.
- [15:46] - Right.
- And it's.
- [15:47] - Yeah.
- Yeah, I feel like
- [15:48] it's always important to go back
- [15:49] into like the raw transcript
of like your tool calls
- [15:53] and your logs and everything
and just view that.
- [15:56] - Exactly, and I think another thing
- [15:57] is that as people are
building more things like MCPS
- [16:00] and trying to connect
Claude to more things,
- [16:03] I think a very natural first
instinct that people have
- [16:07] that's very wrong is that an MCP
- [16:10] or tools should be
one-to-one with your API
- [16:13] and I think actually tools
for the model or MCPs
- [16:17] should be one-to-one with
your UI, not your API.
- [16:21] Because ultimately the model
is a user of these things.
- [16:24] It's not, it doesn't work
like a traditional program.
- [16:27] So if your API might have
three separate endpoints
- [16:30] for say loading a Slack conversation
- [16:34] and turning a user ID into a username
- [16:37] and turning a channel
ID into a channel name.
- [16:40] If those are the tools you give the model
- [16:41] to understand Slack, for
it to understand anything,
- [16:45] it's gonna have to make three tool calls.
- [16:47] Versus as a user, you know,
- [16:48] we just see everything
all nicely rendered.
- [16:50] - Oh, that's interesting.
- So you wanna create a tool
- [16:53] or an MCP for the model
- [16:54] that it presents everything all at once
- [16:57] with as little interaction as possible.
- [16:59] Just like for a user it'll be terrible
- [17:01] if every time you had Slack
- [17:02] you had to like click on a user ID
- [17:04] to see what the name was, et cetera.
- [17:06] - Right, right, I like that.
- [17:07] So kind of working back from
like the end state almost
- [17:10] instead of like just trying to map
- [17:11] the technical specs one to one.
- [17:12] - Exactly, and sort of surround
- [17:14] whatever context you need with it.
- [17:15] - What do you think the future of Agents
- [17:18] has in store for us?
- [17:19] Any predictions on these
next six to 12 months?
- [17:22] - I think Agents are gonna
become a lot more pervasive
- [17:25] sort of starting in
areas that are verifiable
- [17:27] like software engineering.
- [17:29] You know, coding agents have
already changed how I work
- [17:32] and how tons of people at Anthropic work
- [17:35] and I think there's still a huge amount
- [17:36] to be be gained there.
- [17:38] I think one of the really
exciting things is if agents
- [17:40] can start getting better
at verifying their own work
- [17:44] with things like computer use
of, they can write a web app,
- [17:47] but can they go actually
open it up and test it
- [17:49] and then find their own bug
- [17:51] instead of you needing to do that.
- [17:52] I think that's one of
the most exciting things.
- [17:53] - Yeah.
- Is like closing
- [17:54] that loop of testing
- [17:56] so that I don't have to
be Claude's QA engineer.
- [17:58] - Right, so kind of
combining all these things
- [18:00] from the software engineering abilities
- [18:02] to the computer use abilities
- [18:04] once we put all these pieces together.
- [18:06] - Yep, and I think the computer use
- [18:08] is also gonna really open
up a lot of other avenues
- [18:12] and domains where agents
- [18:13] have been sort of locked out of so far.
- [18:15] - What would be an example of that?
- [18:17] - I think that if you want to have Claude
- [18:18] sort of do work for you in a Google Doc.
- [18:21] - Yeah.
- Right now it's,
- [18:22] you know, Claude can write for you
- [18:23] but you're copy and
pasting back and forth.
- [18:25] - Right.
- But if you have computer use
- [18:26] and you say, Hey Claude, can
you clean up this Google doc?
- [18:29] It can just do it right there for you.
- [18:30] Scrolling around,
clicking, editing the text
- [18:32] and that's just such a nicer experience
- [18:34] than needing to copy and
paste back and forth.
- [18:37] - Yeah.
- It's like wherever you are,
- [18:38] Claude can be there with you
if it has with computer use.
- [18:41] - Well I'm very excited to have
Claude write my Google Docs
- [18:43] and respond to all of my comments for me.
- [18:45] - Exactly.
- That'd be
- [18:46] a very nice future.
- [18:48] Erik, this has been great.
- [18:49] Thank you so much for the conversation.
- [18:50] - Absolutely, thank you.
