- [00:01] [Music]
- [00:02] AI assistants excel at supporting
- [00:05] complex analytical tasks such as Supply
- [00:07] Chain management that require multimodal
- [00:10] perception and iterative interaction
- [00:12] between the agent and the user these
- [00:15] agents are powered by large language
- [00:17] models with Advanced capabilities in
- [00:19] planning reasoning memory and Tool
- [00:23] integration today we'll build AI agents
- [00:25] for Content creation and digital
- [00:28] illustration let's get started started
- [00:31] imagine you're a social media manager
- [00:32] for a company launching a new
- [00:35] product to create a social campaign
- [00:38] you'll need two AI agents one for
- [00:40] Content creation and another for digital
- [00:43] Graphics the content creator agent can
- [00:45] help with promotional messages and
- [00:47] generating hashtags while the digital
- [00:49] artist agent designs visuals for your
- [00:51] social posts you'll need a Nim for the
- [00:54] content creator agent a stable diffusion
- [00:57] model for the digital artist agent Lang
- [00:59] chain to orchestrate the workflow and
- [01:01] gradio for user interaction you can find
- [01:04] the Llama
- [01:05] 31405 B Nim in the Nvidia API
- [01:09] catalog this Nim can power a Content
- [01:12] agent to generate marketing materials
- [01:14] the Run Anywhere label means it can be
- [01:17] hosted anywhere in the cloud on Prem or
- [01:20] in a hybrid environment don't forget to
- [01:22] get your API Key by clicking on the get
- [01:24] API key
- [01:26] button next we'll install the Lang chain
- [01:28] Nvidia AI package to integrate the
- [01:30] agents into the workflow and enable Lang
- [01:33] chain to orchestrate the entire process
- [01:36] to create a tool in Lang chain we need
- [01:38] one a decorator to Define it in the
- [01:40] framework two a name with enforced input
- [01:44] and output types and three a description
- [01:47] of the tool and an overview of the input
- [01:50] variable to create a digital artist
- [01:53] we'll bind the stable diffusion model
- [01:54] into a large language model as a tool
- [01:57] for generating images on demand next
- [01:59] will create a function to trigger the AI
- [02:01] agent to produce the desired output
- [02:04] using Lane chain expression language or
- [02:07] LC will refine our digital artist AI
- [02:10] agent to produce outputs from the
- [02:12] received
- [02:13] inputs using with structured output
- [02:16] ensures that the content creator AI
- [02:18] agent generates organized and structured
- [02:20] outputs like promotional text and
- [02:23] hashtags next we'll set up a simple
- [02:25] gradio UI to interact with both agents
- [02:27] adjust prompts and preview results
- [02:31] now comes the exciting part interacting
- [02:33] with our two AI agents first let's call
- [02:36] the content creator agent to craft the
- [02:38] promotional
- [02:40] message and then run the digital artist
- [02:42] to design the visuals you can easily
- [02:45] iterate to polish the
- [02:47] campaign you can experience the AI agent
- [02:49] in your browser and visit the GitHub
- [02:51] repo for source code Enterprise
- [02:54] developers can use Nvidia AI blueprints
- [02:56] to orchestrate complex workflows you're
- [02:59] ready to to supercharge your
- [03:00] productivity with AI agents
