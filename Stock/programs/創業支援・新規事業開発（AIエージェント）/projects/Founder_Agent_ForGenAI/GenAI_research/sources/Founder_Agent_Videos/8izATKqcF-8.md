- [00:00] Before we dive in, I just want to wish
- [00:02] everyone happy holidays and hope you're
- [00:04] having a great time wherever you're
- [00:06] watching from. But today, we're
- [00:07] uncovering some major new updates to
- [00:09] Cloud Code. For those who do not know
- [00:11] what Cloud Code is, it's enthropic
- [00:13] aentic coding tool that lives directly
- [00:15] inside your terminal. And it's already
- [00:17] been really solid for executing routine
- [00:19] coding tasks as well as handling complex
- [00:22] code bases. Now, things just leveled up
- [00:25] cuz ever since Gemini 3.0 launch. The
- [00:28] Google team has rapidly evolved their
- [00:30] own CLI tool with many features like
- [00:32] multi- aent support and LSPs. And that
- [00:36] pressure pushed Enthropic to actually
- [00:38] move faster with their development. And
- [00:40] as a result, Claude Code now supports a
- [00:43] ton of new powerful features, including
- [00:45] LSP, which stands for language server
- [00:47] protocol. You have asynchronous
- [00:49] background agents so that you can run
- [00:51] multiple agents at once, higher limits,
- [00:54] and so much more. So with that said,
- [00:56] let's dive straight in. To start off,
- [00:58] Cloud Code now has introduced a huge new
- [01:01] update, native LSP support, which stands
- [01:04] for language server protocol. In the
- [01:06] most recent change log, Cloud Code had
- [01:08] added an LSP tool that unlocks real code
- [01:11] intelligent features like go to
- [01:13] definition, finding references, hovering
- [01:16] through documentation, and having
- [01:17] real-time diagnostic. This is honestly a
- [01:20] massive leap forward for Cloud Code cuz
- [01:23] this extension where you can access
- [01:25] through the plugins is where it supports
- [01:27] LSP and it means that Claude can tap
- [01:30] into the same signals your editor uses
- [01:33] to understand a codebase. What happened
- [01:35] before was that Claude would had to read
- [01:37] through multiple files, run type
- [01:39] checkers, and stick everything together
- [01:41] with the error messages to figure out
- [01:43] what was actually broken. But now with
- [01:46] LSP, pod gets instant diagnostics and it
- [01:49] knows exactly where errors are and it
- [01:52] can jump directly to definitions and see
- [01:54] type information in real time. This is
- [01:57] also something that works better for
- [01:59] teams cuz you can package your LSP
- [02:01] configurations into a plug-in and
- [02:03] publish it into your internal
- [02:05] marketplace. So instead of having each
- [02:07] developer configure things individually,
- [02:10] you can set it up for the whole team
- [02:12] basically through this configuration.
- [02:14] You need to make sure that you are on
- [02:16] the latest Cloud Code version, which is
- [02:18] version 2.0.55.
- [02:20] And to access it, once you have
- [02:22] configured your plugin, you can then
- [02:24] access it using the /plugin command. And
- [02:27] then you're going to be able to access
- [02:28] all of the LSPs that you had configured
- [02:31] and created. Before we dive in, allow me
- [02:34] to introduce today's video sponsor,
- [02:36] Verda. If you're tired of US
- [02:38] hyperscalers and want a true European
- [02:41] alternative, Verda, formerly known as
- [02:43] Data Crunch, is the cloud you need. New
- [02:46] name, new logo, but the same mission.
- [02:48] It's a privacy first Europe based cloud
- [02:51] that's built specifically for AI
- [02:53] workloads. Your data stays secure,
- [02:56] compliant, and fully in Europe. There's
- [02:58] no crossber uncertainty, no vague
- [03:01] promises. Verda keeps it transparent
- [03:04] where pricing is up to 90% cheaper than
- [03:07] traditional hyperscalers. And this is
- [03:10] with no hidden fees and complete
- [03:12] visibility. What's nice is that Verda
- [03:14] gives you an easy selfservice access to
- [03:16] the latest Nvidia GPUs, including their
- [03:19] B200 as well as the B300 with setups
- [03:24] with high-speed GPU VMs, the Infinib
- [03:27] band clusters, and bare metal systems or
- [03:30] fully managed AI services. All of this
- [03:33] is optimized for AI at scale. And you're
- [03:36] never on your own. You have direct
- [03:38] support from AI infrastructure engineers
- [03:40] that help you optimize and scale your
- [03:43] workloads quickly. Plus, Verta runs on
- [03:46] 100% renewable energy, combining high
- [03:48] performance AI compute with
- [03:50] sustainability. Also, here is an
- [03:53] exclusive offer for World of AI viewers.
- [03:55] You can use the code World of AI25 to
- [03:58] get $25 in free compute credits, which
- [04:01] I'll leave a link to in the description
- [04:02] below. No upfront payments, no credit
- [04:04] cards required. Use the link in the
- [04:06] description below to claim that. That's
- [04:08] Verda, the European transparent,
- [04:10] sustainable AI infrastructure that's
- [04:13] built for builders like you. Next is
- [04:16] where Santa Claus is here cuz the
- [04:18] Enthropic team is gifting all Pro and
- [04:21] Max plans two times their usual usage
- [04:24] limit through New Year's Eve. This is
- [04:26] where you have more usage than your
- [04:28] usual amount, and you're going to be
- [04:30] able to do a lot more within Cloud Code.
- [04:33] Another nice quality of life update is
- [04:35] where you can now add context window
- [04:37] information directly to your status
- [04:39] line. You can use the status line
- [04:41] command and you can customize what shows
- [04:43] up. For example, you can ask cloud to
- [04:45] add a progress bar that shows how much
- [04:47] of the context window you're currently
- [04:49] using in real time. This will be super
- [04:51] useful because you can immediately see
- [04:53] when you're getting close to your
- [04:55] context limit instead of finding out
- [04:56] after responses start getting cut off or
- [04:59] degraded. It's a small feature, but it
- [05:01] gives you more visibility and control
- [05:03] when you're working with longer coding
- [05:05] sessions. Also, if you are to use the
- [05:07] /stats command within this session of my
- [05:10] account, you're going to be able to get
- [05:12] a good overview of how much usage you
- [05:15] had in different sections of the year,
- [05:18] and it will also showcase the amount of
- [05:20] sessions you had, current uh streak, as
- [05:22] well as active days. This is just a good
- [05:24] way to get a good idea of your usage
- [05:27] with cloud code. Next is probably one of
- [05:29] the biggest features a part of this
- [05:30] video and this is where cloud code now
- [05:32] has the ability to run agents
- [05:34] asynchronously where once you have a
- [05:37] agent working on a main task you can
- [05:40] deploy a sub agent to tackle another
- [05:42] task asynchronously. How it functions is
- [05:45] really easy. You first initiate a task
- [05:48] with cloud code and you can just request
- [05:50] it to to do any task and if you want to
- [05:53] have another sub agent working in the
- [05:55] background then you can press Ctrl +B
- [05:58] and this will move to a sub agent
- [06:00] executing a task and it's going to be
- [06:02] allowed to communicate and share
- [06:04] information simultaneously to the main
- [06:07] agent.
- [06:09] Now, as I was reading through the latest
- [06:11] change lock, I had noticed that they had
- [06:14] reintroduced Ultrathink. Now, for those
- [06:16] who do not know, Ultraink is a special
- [06:19] trigger word that you can actually
- [06:22] access while you're using Cloud Code.
- [06:25] This is essentially to tell Cloud Code
- [06:27] to use its maximum available reasoning
- [06:29] budget, meaning the system spends a bit
- [06:31] more compute and tokens thinking deeply
- [06:34] about your problem before responding.
- [06:36] And this is something that I really love
- [06:38] to use because it is especially useful
- [06:40] for hard problems when you want better
- [06:42] quality as well and when you want it to
- [06:45] create architectures working with
- [06:47] unfamiliar code bases or intricate
- [06:49] logical issues. So if I have to tell it
- [06:52] to build a calendar app, it is going to
- [06:54] spend more time and it is going to be
- [06:56] able to exceed the reasoning budget to
- [06:59] get the best generation out of cloud
- [07:02] code. And just take a look at the
- [07:04] calendar app that it generated. Now,
- [07:06] this is something that is really
- [07:07] qualitative and you can see that thanks
- [07:09] to the ultra think mode, it was able to
- [07:12] reason and exceed the reasoning budget
- [07:14] to generate a better looking app
- [07:16] obviously, but with more features and
- [07:18] more creativity that is going to allow
- [07:21] you to use this app in a better fashion.
- [07:24] Obviously, it spends more, but still
- [07:26] you're going to get the best generation
- [07:27] out of it. Looks like cloud code is now
- [07:29] on Chrome. So you can now test code
- [07:32] directly in the browser. So you can
- [07:34] validate your work directly from the
- [07:36] terminal to your Chrome browser. Clot
- [07:38] can even see client side errors through
- [07:41] console logs making debugging much
- [07:43] faster. So you can try this out using
- [07:45] the / Chrome command. This probably
- [07:47] doesn't even affect you, but I want to
- [07:49] cover it cuz my channel is a newest
- [07:51] channel. And you can actually now run
- [07:53] claude code tasks directly from your
- [07:55] cloud Android app. You can run research
- [07:57] previews. You can start a task from your
- [07:59] phone and then let them run in the
- [08:01] cloud. You can review merge the results
- [08:04] afterwards. This is a pretty helpful
- [08:06] feature if you use these tools off of
- [08:08] your phone. So, it's now supported for
- [08:10] Android. And if you want to get started,
- [08:11] you can download it now. Today a really
- [08:14] really subtle new feature is if you are
- [08:16] to use altp you're going to be able to
- [08:19] select models directly and you can now
- [08:22] use this paper cut so that it is going
- [08:24] to allow you to easily switch to
- [08:26] different models mid prompt. Now, if you
- [08:28] remember two months ago, Claude had
- [08:30] introduced code skills or claude code
- [08:33] skills and essentially it acts like a
- [08:35] smarter coding assistant by loading
- [08:37] reusable task specific modules and that
- [08:40] could include instructions, scripts,
- [08:42] resources. Instead of guessing how to do
- [08:44] something from a prompt, Claude can pull
- [08:47] through different skills that it already
- [08:49] has to consistently handle specialized
- [08:51] tasks like analyzing data, generating
- [08:54] images with certain models, or following
- [08:56] team workflows. And essentially, it is
- [08:59] so that you work a bit smarter, faster,
- [09:02] and more reliably with pre-custom
- [09:04] plugins or skills you can say. But
- [09:07] what's new is that Claude recently
- [09:09] expanded agent skills into an open
- [09:11] standard and it is something that kind
- [09:14] of reminds me of MCPs. This ecosystem is
- [09:17] going to let skills be shared and used
- [09:19] across cloud apps, cloud code and
- [09:21] through the API and it enables a partner
- [09:24] build skill from marketplaces or other
- [09:26] tools. Skills is now supported with
- [09:29] different source of bite management and
- [09:31] partner directories. So, it makes it
- [09:33] super easy to deploy them with various
- [09:36] sorts of workflows and teams. There's
- [09:39] also a new cloud code integration with
- [09:41] Slack. And this is where you can now
- [09:43] delegate tasks from Slack directly to
- [09:46] Claude, moving context from
- [09:47] conversations straight to coding
- [09:49] sessions seamlessly, which is a really
- [09:52] helpful feature for teams who work off
- [09:54] of Slack. And this way, you can easily
- [09:57] have a better workflow running. Also, a
- [10:00] new guey dropped. It's called AutoCloud.
- [10:02] I'm not sponsored by them or anything.
- [10:04] It's just something that I saw could be
- [10:06] beneficial. It reminds me of Vancanban
- [10:08] board and you can essentially have
- [10:11] multiple tasks running asynchronously
- [10:13] with this new feature that they launched
- [10:15] and it is going to showcase a UI of it
- [10:17] running in different areas. It is a
- [10:20] standalone app. I'm not affiliated with
- [10:22] them. It just looks like a really
- [10:24] helpful app that you can use
- [10:25] autonomously with Cloud Code. Now,
- [10:27] there's a lot more features to this new
- [10:29] Cloud Code update. You can see that they
- [10:31] have been meticulously updating a lot of
- [10:34] features in the background. Like the
- [10:36] asynchronous update was something that
- [10:38] not everyone actually knows about. This
- [10:40] was something that you would only know
- [10:42] about it if you were to read the change
- [10:44] log. So I highly recommend that you read
- [10:46] through all of these new small features.
- [10:48] I also recommend that you follow this
- [10:50] user here. He is one of the uh community
- [10:53] members at Cloud Code and he has been
- [10:56] showcasing a lot of new features on a
- [10:59] daily basis. may not be big, but these
- [11:01] are small updates that showcase what you
- [11:04] can do with cloud code and with these
- [11:05] new features. If you like this video and
- [11:08] would love to support the channel, you
