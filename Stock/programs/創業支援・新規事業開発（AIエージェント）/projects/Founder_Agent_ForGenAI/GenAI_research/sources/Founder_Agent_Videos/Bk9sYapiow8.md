- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] I am super excited to start a new series
- [00:07] and this series will be specifically on
- [00:09] agentic rag and its various types. Now
- [00:13] as you all know rag is one of the most
- [00:15] important technology right now in every
- [00:18] companies there is a huge amount of
- [00:20] demand because now companies are
- [00:22] focusing more on automating their
- [00:23] workflows and rag using rag is one of
- [00:26] the most fundamental use cases that many
- [00:29] people are implementing. This
- [00:30] information I usually get from all the
- [00:32] interviews from all the students who
- [00:34] have actually attended. I keep on asking
- [00:36] them for various feedbacks and reviews
- [00:38] like how should I probably go ahead with
- [00:40] the next series and this was the next
- [00:42] series that I had actually planned
- [00:44] already. I have covered traditional rag
- [00:46] system. I've also uploaded a crash
- [00:47] course on 2 hours crash course on it
- [00:50] which you can actually go ahead and
- [00:51] watch. Now quickly let me go ahead and
- [00:54] share my screen and let me talk about
- [00:56] like what all things we will be
- [00:58] discussing in agentic rag. how we will
- [01:00] be covering them which all different
- [01:01] types of agentic rag we will be covering
- [01:04] by which frameworks we'll be using each
- [01:06] and everything I'll be discussing about
- [01:07] and I'll also show you some of the code
- [01:09] samples like how I have actually
- [01:11] prepared because this series uh will be
- [01:14] definitely an amazing series so let me
- [01:16] quickly go ahead and share my screen
- [01:18] over here so here uh if you go ahead and
- [01:20] search for complete rack cash course
- [01:23] with languin in 2 hours here uh we have
- [01:27] focused more on traditional rack systems
- [01:29] but now we are moving one step ahead
- [01:31] where we are going to just focus on
- [01:33] agentic rag and its type. So uh how we
- [01:36] are going to cover what all things we
- [01:38] are basically going to cover over here.
- [01:40] Now agentic rag types complete road map
- [01:43] from basic to advanced. Okay before I go
- [01:45] ahead there is one quick announcement
- [01:47] since currently uh you have an amazing
- [01:51] festive season. So on all our live
- [01:54] courses we are providing 20% off. Use
- [01:57] code AI20 and you should be able to
- [02:00] probably take up any course by and we
- [02:03] are trying to provide 20% off over here
- [02:05] because many people were requesting for
- [02:07] it. Okay. So any of the courses that you
- [02:09] really want to go ahead and explore from
- [02:11] AI leaders to professional and this is
- [02:13] the recent course that we are coming up
- [02:15] with that is ultimate rag boot camp.
- [02:17] Okay. And this particular boot camp will
- [02:19] be quite amazing. We are going to go
- [02:20] ahead and take this live classes for
- [02:22] four to five months and this is probably
- [02:24] the last boot camp for 2025. Now let me
- [02:27] go ahead and show you the entire road
- [02:28] map how we are going to cover up this
- [02:30] specific series. So our learning journey
- [02:33] will start with very simple projects
- [02:36] like wherein we will be using routing
- [02:38] based track for understanding core
- [02:40] concepts. Then we'll try to add
- [02:42] intelligence okay wherein we are going
- [02:44] to use multi-step reasoning for complex
- [02:46] queries. Then we are going to optimize
- [02:48] it with adaptive rag. Then we are going
- [02:50] to ensure quality by using self
- [02:53] self-reflective and corrective rags.
- [02:55] Okay. Then finally we are also going to
- [02:57] go ahead and scale it up by using
- [02:59] hierarchal systems for enterprise needs.
- [03:01] Right. So we also say it as hieral rag.
- [03:04] So here uh is the recommended path you
- [03:06] know. Um here we have just written week
- [03:09] 1 2 one one right? But uh my pace of
- [03:13] recording the video will be much more
- [03:14] faster only if you make sure to reach
- [03:17] the target of 1,000 likes for every
- [03:19] video that I upload. Right? Because this
- [03:21] definitely takes a lot of efforts. So
- [03:23] I'm requesting you to do that. Okay? So
- [03:26] quickly first of all we will be focusing
- [03:28] on um aentic rag and then we will also
- [03:31] be focusing on routing based agentic
- [03:33] rag. Here uh the foundational pattern
- [03:35] where an agent intelligently route
- [03:36] queries to appropriate specialized
- [03:39] knowledge base or retrievers. Perfect
- [03:41] starting point for learning agentic rag.
- [03:43] Okay, here it is basically suitable for
- [03:45] all these particular use cases. Then we
- [03:47] go with the next step that is multi-step
- [03:49] reasoning rag. And here we are going to
- [03:51] go ahead and decompose complex questions
- [03:53] into sub questions. Retrieve information
- [03:55] iteratively for each and synthesize
- [03:58] comprehensive answers. So here again we
- [04:00] will go ahead and develop this
- [04:01] completely from scratch so that you
- [04:03] should be able to understand it and one
- [04:05] of the most common frameworks that we
- [04:06] are specifically going to use is lang
- [04:08] graph. Okay. So lang graph we are going
- [04:10] to specifically use because it is very
- [04:12] very much helpful for creating agentic
- [04:14] capabilities rag. Okay. Now coming to
- [04:17] the third one that is adaptive rag. As
- [04:20] we said right we will be adding more
- [04:22] intelligence right and how what is
- [04:24] adaptive rag? What is the architecture
- [04:26] of adaptive rag and where all different
- [04:28] kind of use cases we can specifically
- [04:30] use? We will be discussing about that.
- [04:32] Okay. Then we come to the
- [04:33] self-reflective rag. Inside this we are
- [04:36] going to make sure to uh evaluate each
- [04:39] and every output that is basically
- [04:40] generated by the LLM. We'll identify the
- [04:43] gap and we'll iteratively improve the
- [04:45] best information. Okay. Then uh we go
- [04:47] with react agentic act. React is one of
- [04:50] the most popular um architecture that is
- [04:54] specifically used. It combines reasoning
- [04:56] and acting in an interl manner. Right?
- [04:59] So we will try to understand how does a
- [05:00] reactive react agentic rag basically
- [05:03] works and finally we go ahead with
- [05:05] corrective and then hierarchal agent
- [05:07] rag. So this will be the series. This
- [05:09] will be the quick comparison. You can
- [05:11] see over here how quickly we can
- [05:12] actually do it. how much retrieval it
- [05:15] basically takes you know what is the
- [05:17] speed which is faster which is medium
- [05:19] for different kind of use cases you
- [05:21] definitely require different kind of
- [05:23] rags okay so this is the brief road map
- [05:25] that how we are going to specifically
- [05:27] cover uh the entire rag okay now coming
- [05:30] to the next thing is that how the coding
- [05:32] pattern will be how we are going to go
- [05:34] ahead and create it so this is just one
- [05:36] example of multi-agent hierarch
- [05:38] hierarchy so this is uh basically multi
- [05:41] multi- aent hierarchy drag and here you
- [05:44] can see that how we will implement
- [05:45] something like this. The main important
- [05:47] thing is that creating workflows. So
- [05:49] let's say that in this particular
- [05:50] example this is the workflow that we
- [05:52] have created right we'll explain about
- [05:54] this we'll step by step uh decide our
- [05:57] state information each and every node
- [05:59] along with the node definition will be
- [06:00] created with the help of lang graph.
- [06:02] Similarly we'll go ahead and see
- [06:04] multi-step agentic rag. So here you can
- [06:06] see how beautifully the workflow is and
- [06:08] based on this workflow we'll try to
- [06:10] understand it. Then you also have
- [06:11] self-reflective life. So all the
- [06:13] materials are ready. I just need to go
- [06:15] ahead and record it and explain it. So
- [06:17] retrieve, generate, reflect, finalize,
- [06:20] refine. How do we basically why do we
- [06:22] use self-reflective lag like that? And I
- [06:24] hope you have also heard about react
- [06:26] agent. So this is the react agent and if
- [06:28] you could just go ahead and see the
- [06:29] react agent workflow, it looks something
- [06:31] like this wherein we have reasoning
- [06:33] acting and then we probably keep on
- [06:35] iterating this unless and until we get
- [06:37] the right output. Okay. Then you also
- [06:40] have the route agent. So here you'll be
- [06:42] able to see this is the route agent and
- [06:43] we'll take different different data
- [06:45] sets. We'll we'll also create our own
- [06:46] custom data set. Uh we'll think about
- [06:49] the use cases. The use cases will be
- [06:51] defined in this specific manner. Okay.
- [06:53] So that you will be able to understand
- [06:55] it. So that is the pattern that we are
- [06:56] going to follow for this particular
- [06:58] series and it'll be quite interesting
- [07:00] because we will take only one
- [07:02] architecture at a time and then we will
- [07:05] try to implement it completely from
- [07:06] scratch using langraph. Okay. So that
- [07:09] will be the pattern that we are going to
- [07:10] follow over here now. Uh the other thing
- [07:12] is that uh please make sure that before
- [07:14] you come to this particular series right
- [07:17] uh there are some prerequisite you
- [07:18] really need to be good at Python you
- [07:20] need to know what is exactly traditional
- [07:22] rag. So here I have already uploaded
- [07:24] this amazing 2 hours course that is more
- [07:26] than sufficient to start with the
- [07:27] traditional rag if you are able to
- [07:29] understand over here you'll understand
- [07:30] about vector databases you'll understand
- [07:32] about retrieval you'll understand about
- [07:34] tools. So all those things have been
- [07:36] covered over here in this specific
- [07:37] video, right? And then final
- [07:39] announcement, yes, you have 20% off on
- [07:43] all our courses uh live courses. You can
- [07:46] go ahead and check it out. All the
- [07:47] information will be given in the
- [07:48] description of this particular video.
- [07:50] Now as I said there's a lot of effort
- [07:53] you know from past one week I have been
- [07:55] coding coding coding and created all
- [07:57] this definite tracks and at the end of
- [07:59] the day we also going to create an
- [08:00] amazing end to- end project right
- [08:02] modular coding and all right so this
- [08:04] really takes a lot of effort so uh
- [08:06] appreciate that try to share with most
- [08:08] of your friends hit a like I know it
- [08:11] won't take a second for you but
- [08:12] definitely this will motivate me a lot
- [08:14] so yes this was it from my side in the
- [08:16] next video we will first of all start
- [08:19] with a simple agentic rag and then we'll
- [08:22] talk about routing agent, we'll talk
- [08:24] about react agent and all. So, thank
- [08:25] you. This was it from my side and I
- [08:27] think every 2 days I will upload a
- [08:29] video. If you achieve the target
- [08:31] quickly, every day the video will be
- [08:32] uploaded. Thank you. This was it from my
- [08:34] side. I'll see you in the next video.
- [08:35] Bye-bye. Take care.
