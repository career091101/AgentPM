- [00:00] Okay, so we haven't really done any MCPS
- [00:02] in Codeex before. So today I wanted to
- [00:05] take a quick look at how we can actually
- [00:08] set up MCP servers in Codex and generate
- [00:11] what you see now, a very cool and
- [00:13] impressive avatar uh MCP workflow. Okay,
- [00:18] so the full video you just saw, the
- [00:20] intro here was just generated by one
- [00:22] image and some MCP servers that we're
- [00:25] going to take a look at today that I've
- [00:27] been wanting to try out using codecs. So
- [00:30] the result you saw here now was kind of
- [00:32] the result of this full workflow I have
- [00:34] generated just by using MCP servers. So
- [00:37] that is what I want to go through today.
- [00:39] How I've been experimenting with codecs
- [00:41] lately and GPT5 and MCP servers because
- [00:44] I didn't know so much about that. So I'm
- [00:46] just going to walk you through how I set
- [00:48] up this workflow here and how we can
- [00:50] create this avatar videos just for an
- [00:53] from an image and an audio file. Okay.
- [00:56] So uh if we go into codeex right uh we
- [00:59] do slash MCP you can see I added some
- [01:02] MCP tools here. So this is actually the
- [01:05] first time I have used MCP tools in uh
- [01:07] Codeex. So I have my Reddit server if I
- [01:11] wanted to get some external um yeah
- [01:13] context. Uh, I don't think we're going
- [01:15] to do that today, but that is something
- [01:16] you can do. You can create like a short
- [01:18] clip just from a Reddit post. We might
- [01:20] even try that. Let's see about that. So,
- [01:22] I have my 11 Labs music uh if I want
- [01:25] some background music. My 11 Labs voice
- [01:27] over MCP Nano Banana to create those
- [01:31] edits you saw to different angles for
- [01:33] the video. And I have the avatar video
- [01:36] generator that's using the Omni model
- [01:39] from Bite Dance. I think that's a pretty
- [01:41] cool model. So we only need like an
- [01:44] audio and a image as an argument to
- [01:47] generate that video. So what I wanted to
- [01:50] do today was basically just go through
- [01:53] how uh not exactly how I set this up
- [01:56] because I have shared all these MCP
- [01:58] servers on uh let me show you here on
- [02:00] the all about AI um GitHub. So you can
- [02:04] see all the MCP servers here are now
- [02:06] shared. So if you are a member or you
- [02:08] want to become a member to get access to
- [02:09] these servers, you can just yeah sign up
- [02:11] below to become a member. But I've
- [02:12] shared all these here with a good
- [02:14] instructions of how to use them. So
- [02:16] basically what I wanted today was just
- [02:18] to go through and see how well Codeex
- [02:21] performs on my MCP workflow setup here
- [02:24] because I tested it with both cloud code
- [02:27] work very good. So now I want to test it
- [02:29] with codeex because I put all the
- [02:31] servers in here now. So I think we're
- [02:33] just going to get started. We're going
- [02:34] to try to recreate what we did in the
- [02:37] intro that I had with cloud code and
- [02:39] then we're going to do a new one. So
- [02:41] let's uh create a new image. You can see
- [02:43] this is my reference image, right? So
- [02:46] this is what we start with. Uh you're
- [02:48] going to see that we're going to create
- [02:49] different angles and stuff, but let's
- [02:50] just run through it once uh using codecs
- [02:53] and then we're going to do a total new
- [02:55] one, I think. So let me just walk you
- [02:58] through the workflow here. So if I go
- [02:59] here, yeah, I have the preview here. So
- [03:02] I guess we can just close this. So let
- [03:04] me zoom in a bit. So here is kind of the
- [03:06] workflow. So the user is going to
- [03:08] provide an image, right? we're going to
- [03:10] use for the generation. And then the
- [03:12] user is going to provide an audio file
- [03:15] or we can create one using the 11 Labs
- [03:17] MCB server. You can do your own file or
- [03:19] you can create one. And to make the
- [03:22] video immersive, we're going to split
- [03:23] this audio into 5-second chunks plus any
- [03:26] leftover time using ffmpeg because then
- [03:28] we want to take those chunks and create
- [03:31] own images. You saw me changing angle in
- [03:33] the intro. That is what we can do with
- [03:35] that, right? You can see here change
- [03:37] camera angles for each segment. So uh in
- [03:41] the first uh five seconds we have the
- [03:43] original prompt. In the second one with
- [03:45] nano banana we change that to a side
- [03:48] shot angle. We go back to the front. We
- [03:50] do a POV from above. We do a front. We
- [03:52] go back to the side shot. You can do
- [03:54] whatever you want here. Right. For each
- [03:55] segment you can also adjust the I have 5
- [03:58] seconds uh editing. Right. Uh then we're
- [04:01] just going to merge them. Add some
- [04:03] background music. And that's about it.
- [04:05] just put it together again. So it's
- [04:07] pretty simple, but you can do a lot of
- [04:09] complex stuff with this, right? So uh
- [04:11] let's do this now. So I have this
- [04:13] workflow here, right?
- [04:16] So if we go to codecs and I just say
- [04:19] something like read
- [04:21] at workflow, something like that and it
- [04:24] should be up to speed here on u
- [04:29] what it should do, right? Let's just
- [04:31] see. And then I'm just going to say
- [04:33] execute this workflow using the MCP
- [04:35] tools.
- [04:37] Execute this um workflow
- [04:42] using the MCP tools. Something like
- [04:44] that. That should be pretty much it.
- [04:48] So let's see what happens because I know
- [04:52] Codeex with GPD5 is very good at
- [04:53] following instructions, but can it
- [04:55] actually execute on this? I'm not quite
- [04:57] sure. So, I'm just going to see if we
- [05:00] cleaned up the Let me go to server
- [05:04] avatar video. Yeah, we cleaned that up.
- [05:07] Okay. So, let's see here now.
- [05:11] So, we are just setting up audio
- [05:13] processing. Okay. So, I want to see that
- [05:16] we actually are starting using those MCP
- [05:19] servers we have in our workflow, right?
- [05:22] Uh because I haven't really tested too
- [05:23] much on codeex for that. So, I'm just
- [05:26] going to let this run. uh few seconds
- [05:29] and I'm going to take you back when we
- [05:30] start executing on those MCP servers.
- [05:33] Okay, so you can see that was done. That
- [05:35] went actually very good to be honest. So
- [05:38] uh I didn't bring you back but I just
- [05:40] went it let it run through here and you
- [05:42] can see we called all the tools. Uh we
- [05:44] started by calling up the Nano Banana
- [05:46] MCP server to create all the images and
- [05:49] you can see then we went on to generate
- [05:51] the videos. uh we picked the correct
- [05:54] chunk that is was the 5second clip right
- [05:58] and we picked the image and then we uh
- [06:01] had an output path. You can see for the
- [06:03] second video we picked the uh a chunk
- [06:06] and here we picked the side shot image
- [06:08] right and yeah so it seems to work
- [06:11] pretty good and it followed the plan we
- [06:12] created very good so I'm pretty happy
- [06:14] with that. Uh we had some issues here uh
- [06:16] it says that the background music or
- [06:19] this was one segment failed but it did
- [06:21] it again so that worked. Uh but also
- [06:23] with the music we had some tool call
- [06:27] errors but the music was generated and
- [06:29] it is working. So, what we ended up with
- [06:32] was a 17.7
- [06:36] uh second video. Uh this right. So, I
- [06:40] can play a few seconds of it, but it's
- [06:41] basically a replicate of what we started
- [06:43] with. Okay. So, we haven't really done
- [06:45] any MCPS in Codeex before. So, today I
- [06:48] wanted to take a quick look at how we
- [06:50] can actually set up MCP servers in
- [06:52] Codeex and generate what you see. Yeah,
- [06:55] it's basically the one we created
- [06:57] before, right? So, yeah, I'm pretty
- [06:59] happy with this. I thought it worked out
- [07:00] pretty good and it created the plan. It
- [07:02] follow it pretty good. So this is the
- [07:04] plan, right? Update the plan and here we
- [07:08] did everything right. So but I want to
- [07:10] try one more thing. So this time I want
- [07:12] to try to use the Reddit MCP server to
- [07:14] create some kind of voice over script.
- [07:16] Turn that into like a audio file using
- [07:19] 11 Labs and then recreate this uh with a
- [07:23] bit of a longer session. And this could
- [07:25] be some kind of yeah post you would do
- [07:28] on like some uh shorts or Tik Tok or
- [07:31] like an avatar video, right? Talking
- [07:32] head. So let's try it with something
- [07:34] else here. So this time uh I just want
- [07:37] to start with the Reddit MCP server. So
- [07:39] I'm just going to do let's do find a
- [07:42] five top post in the singularity
- [07:44] subreddit. So hopefully now Codeex will
- [07:46] understand that we need to use a Reddit
- [07:48] MCP server here to figure out that. And
- [07:52] then we're going to try to turn that
- [07:53] into like a voiceover script and turn it
- [07:55] into this talking head video, right?
- [07:57] Yeah, that looks pretty good. So, you
- [07:58] can see we used the Reddit MC Peter
- [08:00] server uh singularity five time frame
- [08:04] all. Uh
- [08:07] uh maybe not time frame all. Let's see.
- [08:11] Uh not all time. Um
- [08:16] just use hot posts. Something like that.
- [08:19] We don't want all time. And that's a bit
- [08:21] uh extensive I think. Okay, so that
- [08:24] worked pretty good. Okay, so let's see
- [08:25] here now. So let's do AI is not just
- [08:28] ending entry levelvel jobs is the end of
- [08:30] career ladder as we know it. That's a
- [08:32] good like talking head video. Uh but I
- [08:34] kind of wanted to do a new image. So let
- [08:36] me find like a new image here we can use
- [08:39] for this. Okay, so we had this one. So
- [08:41] this is guy one png, right? Just a image
- [08:45] of a guy with a microphone. Uh he got he
- [08:47] got two microphones, but you get the
- [08:49] idea. That's not the point, right? So,
- [08:51] what we want to do next now is just um
- [08:54] uh do something like this. So, let's do
- [08:56] create a 20 to 30 second voice over
- [08:58] script to explain the post. Uh max 30
- [09:01] seconds, return only spoken words. Send
- [09:03] the VO script as an argument to the 11
- [09:05] Lab MCP server to create a voice for the
- [09:07] script. So, let's just see if we can do
- [09:09] that up front. So, we're going to have
- [09:11] the audio before we run our workflow. I
- [09:13] think that's a good way to do it. You
- [09:15] could of course implement this into the
- [09:16] full workflow, but let's see if we can
- [09:18] make this work here. Okay, so that went
- [09:20] very well. You can see we get this error
- [09:22] tool card, but it's still working. I
- [09:24] don't know what's happening here, but
- [09:25] you can see uh here is the returned. And
- [09:27] if you check the length, 30 seconds on
- [09:30] the spot. So, that was impressive. I
- [09:33] don't know how it did that, but uh yeah,
- [09:34] I'm pretty happy with that. So, what
- [09:36] we're going to do now is just try to
- [09:39] combine our guy image with a career
- [09:41] ladder voice over and try to create this
- [09:44] into like um what do you call it like a
- [09:48] yeah talking head video we can use on
- [09:50] social media or something. So, what I'm
- [09:52] going to do is I'm just going to put in
- [09:53] like guy one here, right? And here I'm
- [09:56] going to do yeah, we can change this to
- [09:59] AI post. And let's just do AI post here,
- [10:04] right? AI post. And that should be
- [10:06] basically it. So now I think we can just
- [10:08] start this over again and do kind of the
- [10:11] full uh workflow. And yeah, let's see if
- [10:15] we can get something uh on the other
- [10:17] side. So I'm think I'm just going to do
- [10:20] quit uh clear codeex. And I'm just going
- [10:23] to do the prompt again. So read
- [10:26] workflow.mmd create a plan to execute
- [10:28] this. And I'm just going to come up with
- [10:30] a plan here. Then we're going to start
- [10:32] it and see if we actually can do this.
- [10:34] Okay. Okay, so we have the plan. So I'm
- [10:35] just going to say execute plan and let's
- [10:38] see what happens if we can actually yeah
- [10:40] now we have a new image. We have a new
- [10:42] uh voice over and yeah we just need to
- [10:44] put everything together and let's see uh
- [10:47] if we get the same results as we did
- [10:49] before. This is a bit longer. It's about
- [10:51] 13 seconds longer but that really
- [10:53] shouldn't change much. We should just
- [10:55] get more chunks and yeah let's see what
- [10:57] happens. So you can see now we have
- [10:59] started we are running the banana image
- [11:01] to create our yeah uh different shots.
- [11:04] And now we are on to generating the
- [11:05] video. So this is looking good. So I'm
- [11:07] just going to take you back when we have
- [11:09] put everything together. We can take a
- [11:10] look at the images here. So we have the
- [11:13] guy, right? We have the angle. So this
- [11:15] is uh Okay, this is from above. Is this
- [11:19] from the side? Yeah, it's not so good
- [11:20] from the side, but this was pretty good.
- [11:24] This was very good to be honest. But
- [11:25] yeah, uh I'm just going to take you back
- [11:26] when we have everything put together
- [11:28] now. Okay, that looks pretty good. So,
- [11:32] all our plans are checked out. Uh, if
- [11:34] you scroll down here, you can see we
- [11:36] have a video, final video with music.
- [11:39] Uh, if the music is too loud, I'm going
- [11:41] to switch back to the other video. But
- [11:42] let's try it out now. Let's watch this
- [11:45] and let's see, uh, is this good? Uh, so
- [11:49] I haven't seen it yet, but yeah, let's
- [11:51] just watch what we created here in using
- [11:54] MCPA workflows.
- [11:55] >> AI isn't just replacing entry-level
- [11:57] tasks, it's compressing the whole career
- [11:59] ladder. When mid-level work is
- [12:01] automated, fewer rungs remain,
- [12:03] promotions slow, and experience stops
- [12:06] being the gatekeeper.
- [12:08] AI isn't just replacing entry-level
- [12:10] tasks. It's compressing the whole career
- [12:12] ladder. When mid-level work is
- [12:14] automated, fewer rungs remain,
- [12:16] promotions slow, and experience stops
- [12:19] being the gatekeeper. The winners won't
- [12:21] be the fastest typist, but the best
- [12:23] problem framers, reviewers, and
- [12:25] relationship builders, people who wield
- [12:27] AI to ship outcomes. Upskill now. Learn
- [12:30] prompt and tool fluency. Cultivate
- [12:33] domain expertise. And double down on
- [12:35] judgment, ethics, and trust. Climb
- [12:37] smarter, not slower. Okay, so I wouldn't
- [12:40] say that was perfect, but this is pretty
- [12:42] good for just uh yeah, simple MCP
- [12:44] workflow with everything automated. And
- [12:47] there's so much more we can do with
- [12:49] this. And I think this is not so bad if
- [12:52] you compare it to like Hey Gen and
- [12:54] Avatar companies like that. So yeah,
- [12:57] that was my experiment so far. I'm
- [12:59] probably going to do uh a bit more work
- [13:00] on this. And like I said, if you're a
- [13:02] member of the channel, if you want to
- [13:03] become a member, just uh follow the link
- [13:06] in the description, send me an email,
- [13:08] and after like a week or so, I will try
- [13:10] to invite you uh when I have the time.
- [13:12] And you can find everything here. So,
- [13:14] hope this gave you some inspiration to
- [13:16] start exploring more with MCPS. And I
- [13:18] was pretty happy uh with Codeex and MCP
- [13:21] servers. I think it's a bit better on
- [13:23] cloud code still, but we will see. It
- [13:25] did follow the instructions very good.
- [13:27] And I yeah, I just enjoyed playing
- [13:29] around with it and I had a lot of fun.
- [13:32] So, like I said, hope this gave you some
- [13:33] inspiration and have a great day and
- [13:35] I'll see you again. Yeah, hopefully next
- [13:37] week.
