- [00:00] hello world it's siraj and we're gonna
- [00:02] build a dating app using chat GPT that
- [00:04] makes money in this video and I want to
- [00:07] show you a demo first as you can see I'm
- [00:09] asking it about a girl that I like that
- [00:12] likes different things rock and roll
- [00:14] anime gaming and it gives me some
- [00:15] examples of gifts to give her I also say
- [00:17] that this is where she lives and here's
- [00:19] the type of food she likes and it
- [00:21] suggests a type of restaurant that I
- [00:22] should take her to okay so this is just
- [00:24] a very simple example I've already made
- [00:26] sales with this from friends just for a
- [00:28] test demo but you can see here that the
- [00:31] first step it's called hitch that's the
- [00:33] name of the app the first step is to
- [00:34] purchase this app it hitches an AI
- [00:36] powered dating coach that offers
- [00:38] on-demand private coaching for singles
- [00:40] let's purchase this for a dollar just
- [00:42] for test purposes and then you can see
- [00:44] here it is with stripe I can enter my
- [00:46] details I can pay for it let me just do
- [00:49] that once I pay the details it's going
- [00:51] to give me a phone number that I can
- [00:54] then text here's the number save the
- [00:56] number you can text or call anytime and
- [00:58] this was paid it's recorded in my stripe
- [01:01] dashboard I've already made some other
- [01:03] sales from friends already here's the
- [01:05] third sale that I made we can see in the
- [01:07] twilio dashboard all of the SMS texting
- [01:10] I'm going to go through each of these so
- [01:12] there are three parts to this tutorial
- [01:13] the demo the tools used and let's build
- [01:16] the MVP so I've already showed you the
- [01:18] demo so let's go right into the tools
- [01:21] that are used the first one is obviously
- [01:22] open ai's API for GPT 3. the second in
- [01:27] chat GPT as well the second one is
- [01:29] twilio and that's for SMS texting the
- [01:31] third one is node.js and that's a
- [01:34] JavaScript runtime environment the next
- [01:37] one is react and react creates
- [01:39] responsive interfaces for JavaScript
- [01:41] applications then we have next.js
- [01:44] next.js is built on top of react and it
- [01:47] allows us to use building blocks to
- [01:49] build web Frameworks then we have stripe
- [01:52] for payments and stripe is accepted in
- [01:54] most countries now and for deployment we
- [01:56] have fly.io it allows us to deploy a
- [01:59] node JS app instantly and scale it as
- [02:01] much as we want and I think it's built
- [02:03] off of gcp Google Cloud then we have
- [02:06] durable durable is a one-click landing
- [02:08] page it's how I built this landing page
- [02:10] right here and then we have brand Mark
- [02:12] and brandmark generates logos for us
- [02:14] using AI in real time so if we go to the
- [02:17] architecture of the DAP we can see how
- [02:19] it works I as a user will first pay
- [02:21] stripe okay so that's going to be a
- [02:23] payment and once I pay stripe then I can
- [02:26] send a text to A number that is given to
- [02:28] me with the twilio API and I'll send
- [02:31] that number a text what gift should I
- [02:33] get a gamer girl it's going to then send
- [02:35] that query to the fly.io server that's
- [02:38] running the app and the app is running
- [02:40] in a JavaScript runtime environment
- [02:42] that's using node.js on top of that
- [02:45] there's react to interact with
- [02:47] responsive web elements and then next.js
- [02:50] on top of that for web interactivity and
- [02:52] performance now next.js and routing by
- [02:55] the way it's also going to do routing
- [02:56] next i.js is going to call the openaiipi
- [02:59] with that query get the result return it
- [03:01] back to the user very simply so that's
- [03:03] kind of the architecture and overview of
- [03:05] how the app works and now let's get to
- [03:07] the third part which is building it and
- [03:09] so by the way which version of GPT am I
- [03:12] using here that's a really good question
- [03:14] I want to have an answer for you the
- [03:16] answer is gpt3 because chat GPT it is
- [03:20] actually not allowed to use that
- [03:21] publicly openai has not publicly
- [03:24] released their API for that so we're
- [03:26] going to use chat GPT as our co-founder
- [03:28] to build this MVP and then we're going
- [03:31] to use gpt3 as the actual chat engine
- [03:34] underneath so let's go into this and
- [03:36] start building so the first step we're
- [03:38] going to do is we're going to ask it
- [03:39] what are some of the use cases of you to
- [03:41] make money so let's ask it that I want
- [03:43] to make money with
- [03:46] um chat GPT what are some ways to do
- [03:50] that
- [03:52] and it's going to give us some it's
- [03:54] going to give us some great examples
- [03:55] it's going to say we can use it to offer
- [03:57] businesses a chat bot service for a
- [03:59] customer communication or you know more
- [04:02] information we could sell templates we
- [04:04] could use it to promote products we
- [04:05] could generate leads for sales all these
- [04:07] things so what we're going to do is
- [04:09] we're going to pick the first one we're
- [04:10] going to offer chat bot services to
- [04:12] businesses and those businesses would be
- [04:14] like you know dating services
- [04:16] consultancies and this could be a tool
- [04:18] to help them you know just help people
- [04:20] more often at scale so how do we build
- [04:22] this thanks GPT for the suggestion on
- [04:24] what to build now how to build it and
- [04:27] believe it or not Chad gbt can tell us
- [04:29] how to build something as well so I
- [04:31] asked it for example
- [04:33] um these are all the things that I've
- [04:34] asked it I was like how do I add a
- [04:36] simple user login signup flow to a react
- [04:38] application here's like it's like here's
- [04:40] step by step how to do it with the code
- [04:42] everything oh my God okay so super
- [04:44] simple stuff but more than that I
- [04:46] thought it was what was really cool was
- [04:48] I asked it literally show me a five-step
- [04:50] tutorial on how to deploy an AI dating
- [04:52] coach that charges ten dollars a month
- [04:54] to access open ai's gpt3 twilio stripe
- [04:57] node.js react.js and next.js and it's
- [05:00] like here it is the five-step tutorial
- [05:02] so we're going to follow the five-step
- [05:04] tutorial that chat topt our co-founder
- [05:06] asked us to do so let's do that
- [05:09] um the first step for us to do is we're
- [05:11] going to go to this GitHub repository
- [05:14] and I'm going to Fork it so that we all
- [05:16] have access to it I'm going to call it
- [05:18] um
- [05:19] chat GPT
- [05:21] demo
- [05:23] or let's call it GPT demo
- [05:26] and so you're going to find this
- [05:28] repository here it's called gbt demo in
- [05:30] my GitHub repository in the video
- [05:31] description so it was made by the
- [05:33] promptable guys so good job promptable
- [05:35] guys so we're going to start with this
- [05:37] thing and so what this is is it's a
- [05:38] react application if you've never coded
- [05:41] in JavaScript that's okay just follow
- [05:43] along with me we're going to do this all
- [05:45] together so the first step is we're
- [05:46] going to download this code the GPT demo
- [05:49] let's download it and once it's
- [05:51] downloaded we're going to see what are
- [05:53] the dependencies that we need here okay
- [05:54] we need node it's already installed we
- [05:57] need a twilio account we need a
- [05:59] ngrok which we don't actually need and
- [06:02] some optional things so let's forget
- [06:03] about all that all we need is node.js so
- [06:06] we've downloaded our application and now
- [06:08] we're going to go into that directory
- [06:12] okay so we're in it and now we're going
- [06:14] to do whatever it says so it says the
- [06:16] first thing we need to do is create a
- [06:18] twilio phone number so let's go to
- [06:20] twilio and twilio is great I used to
- [06:22] work at twilio as a developer educator
- [06:24] so they have amazing I know that they
- [06:26] have amazing solutions for developers
- [06:28] like us
- [06:29] if we go to the console what twilio is
- [06:31] going to do we're going to have to sign
- [06:32] up for an account and it's going to give
- [06:33] us a free 15 promo to sign up so it's
- [06:35] actually free to use
- [06:37] um then we have to pay to remove the
- [06:39] trial of stuff so right now this is a
- [06:42] you know free trial account I actually
- [06:44] paid 20 just to remove the trial logos
- [06:48] on the text messages but it's free you
- [06:50] can do this for free so if we go to
- [06:52] phone numbers it's going to ask us to
- [06:54] generate a phone number so we can go to
- [06:56] phone numbers we can go to buy a number
- [06:59] and you know if you start off you get a
- [07:02] phone number for free so I already have
- [07:03] a number and then we'll go to overview
- [07:05] and you can see already that there's a
- [07:07] bunch of messages that my friends users
- [07:09] have already sent from different numbers
- [07:10] and you can see that
- [07:13] um that's all we have to do and so once
- [07:15] we have a twilio phone number
- [07:17] then we're going to go back to this and
- [07:21] we're going to update our uh twilio
- [07:23] phone number but we need to twilio's
- [07:25] command line interface installed and we
- [07:27] just don't want to do that so all we
- [07:29] have to do is install our dependencies
- [07:31] with npm the node package manager one of
- [07:34] the most ubiquitous package managers in
- [07:37] the developer tooling ecosystem now once
- [07:40] we've done that we're going to copy our
- [07:41] environment variables boom one click
- [07:43] done that now we have to fill in our
- [07:46] twilio and open AI Keys into my personal
- [07:48] phone number okay so in dot end so we'll
- [07:52] go to Nano dot end we'll see that there
- [07:54] are four values here that we have to
- [07:55] fill in the account said the auth token
- [07:58] the phone number and the API key how do
- [08:00] we do all of this so if we go to twilio
- [08:03] we go to the
- [08:04] um
- [08:05] account we're going to see our API keys
- [08:09] and tokens
- [08:11] I'm gonna have to verify
- [08:17] and I have my credentials here and then
- [08:19] I also what else do I need I need my
- [08:21] phone number so I'm going to add my
- [08:23] phone number and then my openai API key
- [08:26] that's super important
- [08:29] so if you go to the openai website we
- [08:31] can get access to our API key we'll go
- [08:33] to view API keys or get a secret key
- [08:36] we'll we'll you know create a new secret
- [08:38] key and copy it and we'll go back here
- [08:41] and we'll paste it in okay
- [08:48] foreign
- [08:53] variable then we're going to compile the
- [08:57] typescript to JavaScript with npm run
- [08:59] build
- [09:00] okay we did that and finally
- [09:04] we can run the project with npm start
- [09:07] okay
- [09:08] so this address is in use so we're going
- [09:10] to have to
- [09:16] okay so now the server is listening on
- [09:18] localhost and if we go to localhost 3000
- [09:21] we can see it's a 200 okay so it
- [09:22] understands us but where we want to go
- [09:24] is messages messages are going to
- [09:26] require a post request not a get request
- [09:28] so let's open up this code and see what
- [09:32] it looks like
- [09:35] so here's the app and if we go into it
- [09:37] we can see under the messages.ts file in
- [09:39] the routes folder what it's doing is
- [09:41] it's going to send a message a query
- [09:43] that we send to it a user sends to it
- [09:45] via SMS it's going to encode that using
- [09:47] twiml and twiml is twilio's markup
- [09:50] language it's a way to encode data so
- [09:53] that it interacts well with twilio's SMS
- [09:57] service and we can see that right here
- [10:01] it's all happening right here you send
- [10:02] the request send it to twilio Returns
- [10:04] the response with open ai's API and uh
- [10:07] that's where the reply is gotten from
- [10:10] asynchronously
- [10:11] so that's that and uh now we can go back
- [10:15] to our repository here if we want to
- [10:18] expose the local server uh publicly we
- [10:20] can use ngrok we don't want to do that
- [10:22] we just want to go directly to deploying
- [10:24] it with fly.io and um before we deploy
- [10:27] it let's make sure and test that it
- [10:28] works and you can see that it works
- [10:30] because every time someone sends a
- [10:33] message uh to this chat bot it's going
- [10:37] to reply and you can see it here and
- [10:39] here's the open AI parameters the max
- [10:42] number of tokens uh the temperature the
- [10:44] stop the ID the object and you know we
- [10:47] can choose how many tokens we want to
- [10:48] generate but remember that we are
- [10:50] charged on a you know token by token
- [10:52] basis at open AI so we don't want to
- [10:53] charge too much
- [10:55] so we have that and uh it works now we
- [10:58] want to deploy it to fly.io so what is
- [11:00] fly.io fly.io is a way to deploy our app
- [11:05] servers close to our users very cool
- [11:07] full stack apps and they've got servers
- [11:10] all over the world I love it it's really
- [11:12] simple to deploy to as well so
- [11:14] fly launch
- [11:17] okay
- [11:20] here's the server we want to deploy it
- [11:22] to
- [11:24] and now we have our app here it is
- [11:26] running in the cloud on fly.io we can
- [11:28] see all the texts we can see all the
- [11:31] metrics all that stuff
- [11:33] um and all that stuff so okay so we have
- [11:35] our app it's running in the cloud but
- [11:38] how do how does a user pay for it right
- [11:41] that's the next question how does a user
- [11:43] actually pay for this service because
- [11:44] right now they just text a number and
- [11:47] the number is going to for free give
- [11:50] them this AI service right using gpt3
- [11:52] that chat GPT helped us build but we
- [11:55] want to have them pay for it so how do
- [11:56] we do that so the way to do that is to
- [11:58] go to durable and I found this great
- [12:00] one-click website to create a landing
- [12:02] page really quickly so let's do it let's
- [12:03] generate our website using AI what type
- [12:06] of business let's say it's a dating
- [12:08] coach
- [12:09] um and it's a you know it's called hitch
- [12:12] and then it's going to use those
- [12:14] keywords it's going to use NLP to design
- [12:16] the website based on what we like so you
- [12:20] can see it's using semantic similarity
- [12:21] to suggest similar words like find love
- [12:23] in this City it's literally generating
- [12:25] customer testimonials it's generating
- [12:28] related text descriptions paragraphs
- [12:32] about our business from scratch and it's
- [12:33] ready we're already so it's ready and we
- [12:35] can share it already in one click here's
- [12:38] our website boom it's live okay so what
- [12:40] do we want to do we want to create a
- [12:41] landing page on this website and it's
- [12:44] just a one-click link on the website
- [12:45] using stripe and then once they click on
- [12:48] the link they have to pay and once they
- [12:50] pay the receipt is going to give them
- [12:51] the number that's going to give them
- [12:53] access to our openai gpt3 but on the
- [12:57] phone okay so how do we do that we're
- [13:00] going to
- [13:02] go back to this we're going to restyle
- [13:05] it
- [13:07] we're going to customize it and we're
- [13:08] going to add a stripe landing page so if
- [13:11] we go to stripe
- [13:15] if we go to payments payment links we
- [13:20] can create a new payment link so this is
- [13:22] a now this is a single page with stripe
- [13:24] that allows us to you know create a
- [13:26] product so I'm going to say it's you
- [13:28] know one dollar you know I'll create a
- [13:29] new product let's create a new product
- [13:31] it's a recurring payment AI dating coach
- [13:34] fun the price is going to be a hundred
- [13:37] dollars a month recurring billing period
- [13:40] is monthly and we'll add the product
- [13:44] and it's there we'll create the link
- [13:47] here's a link
- [13:49] one click link right here boom hundred
- [13:51] dollars a month automatically charged so
- [13:53] what do I need to do we need to go back
- [13:55] to our page and we just need to add it
- [13:57] in it's that simple
- [13:58] just add it in right there in the link
- [14:00] right here boom
- [14:02] just like that cool so now we have our
- [14:05] landing page we have our stripe
- [14:08] integration we have our twilio
- [14:09] integration we have our fly.io app
- [14:12] integration so our app is living in the
- [14:14] cloud now we have everything going on
- [14:15] for us
- [14:16] um now we just need users so we can just
- [14:18] take this website and we can share it
- [14:20] with our friends we can say hey check
- [14:22] this out
- [14:24] here's a link to it and if we wanted to
- [14:25] we could get an actual custom link on
- [14:27] this durable by the way super simple and
- [14:30] that's our app code is going to be in
- [14:31] the video description I hope you use it
- [14:33] to build your own AI startup with chat
- [14:35] GPT or this GPT Suite of apis I'm so
- [14:39] proud of all of you Wizards for who have
- [14:41] been here for years and are continually
- [14:43] improving your careers and making
- [14:45] amazing positive impact in the world and
- [14:47] the coding challenge for this week is to
- [14:48] make your first sale with openai's API
- [14:52] whoever does that submit your GitHub
- [14:53] Link in the comments section below and
- [14:55] I'll announce the winner next week until
- [14:57] then Happy learning and if you make it
- [15:00] to the end I'm gonna wrap with lyrics
- [15:01] generated by chatgpt GPT the AI That's
- [15:05] always on top it's language skills they
- [15:08] never stop generating text that's almost
- [15:11] real GPT the AI that we feel
