- [00:00] Open EI has launched tons of new stuff
- [00:03] that I think shows that the internet as
- [00:05] we knew is dying or at least it's no
- [00:08] longer what we sort of knew it as. So
- [00:11] I'm going to show you a few things that
- [00:12] OpenAI is doing. And not just OpenAI,
- [00:15] there's other companies that are doing
- [00:16] similar things, but this will make it so
- [00:18] that in the year 2026, the internet will
- [00:21] be completely different than any year
- [00:24] prior. Exhibit A. Oxford researchers
- [00:27] just confirmed what we feared. The
- [00:29] internet, as we knew, is dying. AI
- [00:32] content went from around 5% in 2020 to
- [00:36] 48% by May 2025. Projections say 90
- [00:40] plus% by next year. Why? Well, AI
- [00:44] articles cost less than 1 cent. Human
- [00:47] writers cost $10 to $100. And this was a
- [00:51] post by Ask Perplexity. So, they
- [00:53] continue. I just want to kind of make
- [00:54] that distinction because before it was
- [00:56] facts. Now we get maybe a little bit of
- [00:59] conjecture, a little bit of opinion.
- [01:00] They're saying but the real crisis is
- [01:02] model collapse. When AI trains on AI
- [01:05] generated content, quality degrades like
- [01:07] photocopying a photocopy. Rare ideas
- [01:10] disappear. Everything converges to
- [01:12] generic sameness. It's recursive.
- [01:14] Today's AI slop becomes tomorrow's
- [01:16] training data producing worse output
- [01:17] which becomes training data again. So
- [01:20] we'll see how this will affect training
- [01:22] of next generation models. But
- [01:24] definitely the one thing that's obvious
- [01:26] is that very very recently just in the
- [01:28] last few months I would say it seems
- [01:31] like we've crossed the point where the
- [01:33] internet got sort of inverted to where
- [01:35] it went from mostly human to mostly AI.
- [01:39] We just have to read the first comment
- [01:41] here. It's by Asmin Gold. Now Asmin Gold
- [01:44] is a controversial persona. But what I
- [01:47] found very interesting about this is
- [01:49] here he's talking to an AI that's that's
- [01:53] answering. So it's I don't know it's
- [01:55] kind of a good illustration I feel like.
- [01:56] So he is huge on used to be on Twitch
- [01:59] now on YouTube has a large following
- [02:02] started out playing World of Warcraft
- [02:04] and more recently started talking about
- [02:06] politics because I don't know just seems
- [02:08] like the natural progression I guess but
- [02:10] he's saying if the data collection
- [02:12] methods are as simplistic as they
- [02:14] indicate this is one of the dumbest
- [02:15] pieces of research I've ever seen. Are
- [02:17] you using a control to avoid equating an
- [02:20] AI article with less than 10 views with
- [02:22] one written that has like a thousand
- [02:23] plus? AI isn't killing journalism.
- [02:26] Journalists are. The AI bot answers,
- [02:29] "You're absolutely right. Good
- [02:30] question." And provides some context.
- [02:33] Anyways, I just thought this whole thing
- [02:35] is hilarious. It's an AI generated post
- [02:38] that gets a comment from just an
- [02:40] absolutely massive YouTuber. I mean,
- [02:43] he's getting something like 300 million
- [02:46] views on YouTube in the last 30 days.
- [02:48] So, a rather large account, you would
- [02:51] say. Just something about this whole
- [02:54] thing cracks me up. By the way, AI
- [02:56] safety memes posted this of the dead
- [02:58] internet theory update. Four out of the
- [03:01] 10 YouTube channels are AI. Now, of
- [03:03] course, it's not just open AI that's
- [03:05] driving this. There's a lot of players
- [03:07] in the space. Gemini, Anthropic, XAI.
- [03:11] There's a number of AI video models, AI
- [03:14] image models, AI music models. There's a
- [03:17] number of other open-source LMS and
- [03:19] other tools all contributing to this in
- [03:22] part, but there's sort of another layer
- [03:25] on top of this. So, as there's more and
- [03:27] more AI generated content online, Sora 2
- [03:31] is still I think at the top of the
- [03:33] leaderboards is one of the top apps. But
- [03:36] now on top of this, we're getting more
- [03:37] and more agentic stuff that's coming
- [03:40] online. There's another sort of layer
- [03:42] between us and the internet and those
- [03:44] are the agents that we will be using to
- [03:48] interact with the internet in various
- [03:49] ways and in this video we're going to
- [03:51] cover a few things by OpenAI what
- [03:52] they've been announcing how they work
- [03:54] etc. We'll briefly touch about their
- [03:57] massive integration with various
- [03:59] e-commerce platforms. There's also a
- [04:02] thermmoefficient openai collab to
- [04:04] accelerate drug development through AI
- [04:06] integration. Sora 2 has more features.
- [04:09] You can do up to 25 seconds on the web.
- [04:13] There's a storyboard feature. So Sora 2
- [04:16] is certainly on a roll. It doesn't seem
- [04:18] to be stopping. Meanwhile, we have some
- [04:19] news about the Open Eyes forprofit
- [04:23] transition. So looks like Financial
- [04:24] Times projected Open Eyes cap table
- [04:26] following its forprofit transition. So
- [04:29] here's sort of a chart showing what the
- [04:32] ownership of OpenAI will look like.
- [04:34] Looks like about 20 to 30% remains as a
- [04:37] part of the OpenAI nonprofit. 30% going
- [04:41] to employees, the rest to various
- [04:44] investors and partners with apparently
- [04:46] Nvidia's investment diluting everybody
- [04:48] else. As Technium from News Research
- [04:51] pointed out, if the nonprofit has 30%,
- [04:53] then the remaining is 0%. We also have
- [04:56] some new changes to memory to Chad's
- [04:59] memory. No more memory full. It will
- [05:02] automatically manage the memories based
- [05:04] on how relevant they are, how recent
- [05:07] they are, etc. By the way, do you
- [05:08] remember that social similacra paper out
- [05:11] of Stanford? I believe Jung Park was the
- [05:15] author of it, where a number of these
- [05:17] little characters, each one controlled
- [05:20] by an instance of Chad GPT. I don't know
- [05:22] if it was GPT4 or 3.5 Turbo at the time.
- [05:25] I don't recall, but their actions, their
- [05:27] conversations, everything was driven by
- [05:31] its own kind of instance of Chad GPT.
- [05:33] Each one had its own memory. So the
- [05:36] memory stream would flow, all the things
- [05:38] that would happen like whether you know
- [05:40] it turned on the lights, it made coffee,
- [05:43] right? So every event would be logged
- [05:45] but later sort of sorted and analyzed
- [05:49] based on recency, importance, relevance,
- [05:52] right? So each would get a score like
- [05:54] how important is that memory? This was
- [05:57] August 6, 2023. The reason I bring that
- [06:00] up is a couple points. One, as I always
- [06:02] say, we tend to see these research
- [06:05] papers kind of it's almost like a
- [06:07] glimpse into the future. you see
- [06:08] something in a research paper that
- [06:10] suggests a new approach for doing
- [06:12] something or some new discovery and then
- [06:13] the AI labs usually implemented 6 to 12
- [06:17] months later. In this case, it probably
- [06:18] took a little bit longer. And in fact, I
- [06:20] don't think it's quite the same thing as
- [06:22] this, but it's just it's it's
- [06:24] interesting. And two, I just think it's
- [06:26] kind of cool that a lot of this progress
- [06:28] towards AGI is driven by video games in
- [06:32] one way or another. us PC gamers by
- [06:36] purchasing Nvidia cards in the past for
- [06:38] our gaming needs. I like to think of it
- [06:40] as us sort of investing and supporting
- [06:44] the future of AI. You're welcome. But
- [06:46] you've probably played a game or two
- [06:48] yourself, so I guess uh high five. Also,
- [06:50] Sam Alman is said to be loosening up
- [06:53] some of the restrictions for some of the
- [06:55] more adult themes and topics within Chad
- [06:58] GBT. But first and foremost, let's talk
- [07:00] about how agents will be changing the
- [07:03] way that we use the internet. And this
- [07:05] is based on two massive new products or
- [07:08] features that OpenAI has launched. Quick
- [07:10] interruption. This video is brought to
- [07:12] you by Rube from Composeio. I connected
- [07:14] my chat to over 800 apps and ran real
- [07:17] actions without touching an API. Rube is
- [07:20] your super assistant for automation.
- [07:22] Just type which you want, it performs
- [07:24] the steps across all your tools. It
- [07:26] connects to 800 plus apps and can
- [07:28] perform 50,000 plus actions on top of
- [07:31] them. You just say what you want in
- [07:33] plain English and Rube does it for you.
- [07:36] My favorite example is email triage like
- [07:38] this. Setup takes minutes. Go to rub.app
- [07:41] and add MCP points. Rub.appmcp.
- [07:45] Use streamable HTTP in clients like Chad
- [07:48] GBT, Cursor, Cloud Desktop, Mattis,
- [07:50] WhatsApp or VS Code. Rub connects to
- [07:53] hundreds of apps and enables thousands
- [07:56] of actions from Gmail and notion to
- [07:59] Slack, GitHub, and Sheets. Here it pulls
- [08:01] in yesterday's emails, summarizes what
- [08:04] matters, and bulk labels promos all with
- [08:07] one command. Here's Matt Schumer. We've
- [08:09] talked about him on the channel before.
- [08:10] Here's what he said about Rube. One MCP
- [08:13] to rule them all. Watch it analyze
- [08:15] thousands of tweets on Chad GPT and
- [08:18] organized by painpoint in a sheet. By
- [08:20] the way, Rube now integrates with Chad
- [08:22] GBT as well. Use connectors in Chad GBT
- [08:25] to get everything integrated. By the
- [08:27] way, if you want a full tutorial on
- [08:28] this, leave a comment down below. Here's
- [08:30] Dr. Alvaro Cintas. He works with Rowan
- [08:32] on rundown AI. He's using Rube to create
- [08:36] quote insane automated workflows. Watch
- [08:39] it analyze his calendar and prioritize
- [08:40] the week based on his notion tasks. I
- [08:43] really like how it says urgent pay your
- [08:45] electric bills. Those have deadlines.
- [08:47] Rube has a shared memory layer. It
- [08:50] remembers you across sessions and apps.
- [08:52] Login once and you can execute actions
- [08:54] across all of your connections. It runs
- [08:57] in Chad GBT, Claude, Cursor, VS Code,
- [09:00] N8N, and creators are already shipping
- [09:03] content with it. Rub is your one command
- [09:06] center. Control all your digital tools
- [09:08] through AI with simple natural language.
- [09:12] Plug Rube into your workflow today. It's
- [09:14] free to try at rub.app. Thanks to Rub by
- [09:18] Composio for sponsoring this segment. So
- [09:20] on October 6th, Sam Alman announced
- [09:22] OpenAI's new agent kit at the 2025 dev
- [09:25] day. So it's a suite of tools for
- [09:26] building, deploying, and optimizing AI
- [09:29] agents. So we had things like the agent
- [09:32] SDK before, but this just kind of
- [09:35] streamlines it, makes it easier, and has
- [09:38] a easy to use UI with the little
- [09:40] flowcharts. Here's kind of what that
- [09:42] looks like. So here you have your
- [09:44] various functions. They can just kind of
- [09:46] drag out here. Set up connect to other
- [09:48] functions. Let's delete this one for
- [09:50] now. And you basically just drag and
- [09:52] drop. You can move them around. Connect
- [09:54] them as you see fit. So this one for
- [09:56] example is a customer service workflow.
- [09:59] Now for the last decade, I was running
- [10:01] e-commerce stores and I wish I had this.
- [10:05] Oh dear lord, how much easier would my
- [10:08] life have been if I had this? I'm so
- [10:11] frustrated this came out 10 years too
- [10:13] late. So what it is is we start with
- [10:16] basically the input. In this case it
- [10:18] would be a customer service email. So a
- [10:21] customer writes an email to you.
- [10:23] Customers can write these rambling
- [10:25] emails. It's sometimes a little bit
- [10:27] difficult to understand what is it that
- [10:29] they actually want, right? Do they want
- [10:31] a a refund? Do they want to cancel
- [10:32] something? They just want to check on
- [10:34] their order. And in the past, you could
- [10:36] do these like if else then, whatever
- [10:38] logic statements, but you'd fail. They
- [10:40] would fail very, very often because
- [10:42] you're dealing with an unstructured
- [10:44] output by some person typing it on their
- [10:46] iPhone, and you just couldn't
- [10:48] effectively triage this, right? So, here
- [10:51] we have the email coming in, right?
- [10:53] That's the start. That's what begins
- [10:54] this workflow. First and foremost, we
- [10:57] have a they call it the jailbreak guard
- [11:00] rail, but there's actually quite a few
- [11:02] different things in here that are under
- [11:04] that umbrella. Let me just do this.
- [11:06] There we go. So, we have personally
- [11:08] identifiable information. It runs a
- [11:10] check to make sure they're not sending
- [11:12] you stuff that can be harmful if you
- [11:14] post it out there. So, if you just want
- [11:16] to make sure that it doesn't get into
- [11:17] the system, if the workflow doesn't
- [11:19] continue, right? So you can click this
- [11:21] and if it contains any personally
- [11:22] identifiable information, boom, it just
- [11:25] ends their workflow, right? So if it
- [11:26] fails any of the checks that you've uh
- [11:28] initiated, the workflow ends. We have
- [11:30] moderation, right? So if they're saying
- [11:32] naughty things, jailbreak, so this is if
- [11:35] ply the prompter decides to mess with
- [11:37] your AI customer service agent. So this
- [11:40] should detect prompt injection and
- [11:42] jailbreak attempts to keep the model on
- [11:44] task hallucinations. Now this would be
- [11:47] of course when the input is coming from
- [11:49] a model. This isn't if you know if a
- [11:51] human is writing it certainly they could
- [11:53] be hallucinating but this is not what
- [11:55] this is for right. So this kind of just
- [11:57] makes sure that everything's cool. If
- [11:59] it's not cool the process ends. If it is
- [12:01] cool uh we go to the classification
- [12:03] agent and we classify the user's intent
- [12:05] into one of the following categories.
- [12:07] Return item, cancel subscription or get
- [12:10] information. So again we're just showing
- [12:11] the large language model. the email.
- [12:13] We're like, "All right, if you had to
- [12:15] put it into one of these three buckets,
- [12:16] where would you put it?" We can select
- [12:18] our model here, including a GPT5 and
- [12:20] pretty much every other model that ever
- [12:22] existed, we can uh use it here.
- [12:25] Depending on which model you choose,
- [12:27] there's also usually tons of options.
- [12:29] So, if we choose a reasoning model, for
- [12:31] example, like GPT5,
- [12:33] some of these models you have to verify
- [12:35] the organization, your organization for
- [12:37] you to be able to use it. But for the
- [12:39] Owen Pro, so that's a reasoning model.
- [12:41] You can choose the reasoning effort and
- [12:43] I think the reason they do that is
- [12:44] because if you want to see the summary
- [12:46] of the model's internal reasoning
- [12:48] process, the chain of thoughts, right?
- [12:50] You want to verify the company opening
- [12:52] just wants to make sure that a
- [12:54] competitor isn't stealing all that data.
- [12:57] I'm sure that's one of the motivations.
- [12:59] Anyways, here we have the classification
- [13:01] agent that classifies the email. Then
- [13:04] depending on what they decide the email
- [13:07] is, we route it to the correct next
- [13:10] place. In this case, the next agent that
- [13:12] takes over. So if it's a return item, we
- [13:14] go to this node. If it's a cancel
- [13:17] subscription goes here. If it's just get
- [13:18] information goes here. And if it's
- [13:20] something else, we just end the workflow
- [13:22] here. Or if you wanted to, you can start
- [13:24] something else and completely branch out
- [13:25] from here. If you wanted, you needed to
- [13:27] ask a follow-up or whatever. A return
- [13:30] agent offers a replacement device with
- [13:32] free shipping. Of course, you might want
- [13:34] to have a user approval here so that the
- [13:37] a human has to come in and be like,
- [13:38] "Okay, uh uh this works for me." We also
- [13:40] have a retention agent that tries to
- [13:42] save the subscription, information agent
- [13:45] that answers the questions, etc. You can
- [13:47] also add a hallucination guardrail here,
- [13:50] right? So, if you want to make sure the
- [13:51] information agent isn't tripping out of
- [13:54] their mind, you might want to put a
- [13:55] hallucination check there to make sure
- [13:57] that it matches up against your internal
- [13:59] documentation or whatever. they can do
- [14:01] an online search, a file search,
- [14:04] document search, whatever you need. And
- [14:05] of course, you know, whatever else
- [14:07] happens, you can kind of just end the
- [14:08] process after that, right? So, this
- [14:11] would take every customer email that
- [14:12] comes in and sort of figure out what
- [14:15] kind of email it is, what they want, and
- [14:17] then have a specific agent handle that
- [14:20] email. And there's, of course, a million
- [14:22] things you can do with this. The point
- [14:23] is smart automation and that we're going
- [14:26] to be interacting with AI agents a lot
- [14:29] more than humans at this point because
- [14:30] as these models get better and better
- [14:33] more and more tasks can be automated
- [14:35] with simple processes like this. All
- [14:37] right, next we have the third party apps
- [14:40] integration with chatbt. So things like
- [14:42] Spotify, Zillow, Canva and a million
- [14:46] more. Basically a lot of the apps that
- [14:47] are popular online now integrate with
- [14:49] chatbt that you can chat with it. just
- [14:51] tell it what to do and it will actually
- [14:53] use those apps and provide you with the
- [14:55] results. This obviously seems like kind
- [14:57] of a big deal. It's basically the birth
- [14:59] of a new app store. All right, let's
- [15:01] check it out. We're going to use Canva
- [15:03] to create a YouTube thumbnail about how
- [15:06] to build ninja robots because why not?
- [15:09] All right, so notice that it kind of
- [15:11] talks about a little bit, but at some
- [15:13] point we should get a little
- [15:14] notification saying, do you want to use
- [15:16] Canva for this? If you say yes, then
- [15:18] this Canva appears down here. And for
- [15:22] the first time that you're using a
- [15:23] specific app, it's going to say Chpt
- [15:25] wants to connect to that app. Let's say
- [15:27] we click continue. There's some warning
- [15:29] and conditions. And then you're going to
- [15:31] click continue to Canva or whatever app
- [15:33] you're adding. Canva is now connected.
- [15:36] And Chad BT is going to work to create a
- [15:39] thumbnail for us about how to build
- [15:41] ninja robots using Canva. By the way, if
- [15:44] you wanted to add more apps, you can do
- [15:46] so here. Go to add sources, add. You can
- [15:50] connect any of the following ones you've
- [15:51] already connected as well as a Gmail,
- [15:53] calendar, contacts, box, or connect
- [15:55] more. And if you scroll down, you have
- [15:57] browse apps. So, we have Corsera,
- [15:59] Spotify, Zillow, Figma, HubSpot, Notion,
- [16:03] Outlook, Slack, etc., etc., etc. Or we
- [16:06] can even do kind of customize and add
- [16:08] our own. So, here you're able to add
- [16:10] unverified connectors. Use at your own
- [16:13] risk. Let's try Spotify. And now it's
- [16:15] connected. So now we are able to add
- [16:18] sources and and now we should be able to
- [16:22] call upon Spotify to play us our
- [16:24] favorite content. Before we do that,
- [16:26] let's check out our Canva. If it
- [16:28] finished working and making our
- [16:29] thumbnails for building ninja robots, I
- [16:32] got to say it did a phenomenal job. Look
- [16:34] at that. If this is not a ninja robot, I
- [16:38] don't know what is. It even came up with
- [16:39] a pretty cool tagline. Stealth meets
- [16:42] technology. So all this has done is by
- [16:44] saying hey use a Canva to do this and it
- [16:47] does so. So so now I don't have to go to
- [16:49] Canva use their UI or interact with that
- [16:52] web page in any way. I can just sort of
- [16:54] interact with Chad GPT and use that app
- [16:57] however I want to. Let's see if I can
- [16:59] say use Spotify just to kind of invoke
- [17:02] it. Yeah, there it is. Okay, so Spotify
- [17:04] is ready to use. So I can say whatever I
- [17:08] want. What are the top 20 AI podcasts? I
- [17:11] wonder if it knows I'm okay. He knows
- [17:13] I'm talking about Spotify. Good. Because
- [17:14] it has a context. Hooray. Not one of
- [17:17] those podcasts is my podcast. I'm
- [17:20] considering hitting the thumbs down
- [17:21] button. Bad robot. No, I'm not going to
- [17:24] do that. But that feels kind of petty,
- [17:26] but I am irked. What are the latest
- [17:27] episodes on the AI pod by Wesson Dylan?
- [17:30] Let's see if we can uh make sure it
- [17:33] pulls the right podcast this time. All
- [17:35] right, there it is. The last one is our
- [17:37] interview with the CEO and founder of
- [17:39] Apollo Research. And we're going to say
- [17:41] play the latest episode. All right. So,
- [17:43] I have to click to play and it'll take
- [17:45] me to Spotify where I can listen to it.
- [17:47] So, it looks like still it's not
- [17:48] integrated within Chad GBT, but I can
- [17:51] find all the episodes kind of browse,
- [17:53] get some more information about them.
- [17:54] So, I'm going to say, why is my podcast
- [17:56] not number one when I ask for AI podcast
- [17:58] and how do you rank them? I know I'm
- [18:00] being childish, but just please humor
- [18:02] me. So, it actually spells out kind of
- [18:04] like what it's looking at to make sure
- [18:07] that it's returning the right results.
- [18:09] So, I do want to check this, but it's
- [18:12] definitely giving me some ideas about
- [18:14] how to maybe optimize some of my
- [18:17] podcasts to appear more in Chad GPT.
- [18:19] Now, this is probably for me, but if you
- [18:21] have an app out there, you have a
- [18:22] website, you have your own podcast, you
- [18:24] might be aware that more and more
- [18:26] traffic is flowing through Chad GBT,
- [18:29] right? So, let Chad GBT flow through
- [18:31] you, right? So more and more of our
- [18:33] queries and referrals are flowing
- [18:35] through Chad Gypt. So if you have apps,
- [18:38] websites, businesses, whatever, it's
- [18:40] going to be important to start figuring
- [18:41] out how to make sure that you're getting
- [18:43] your slice of the pie from ChadBt when
- [18:45] people are asking about stuff that might
- [18:47] be relevant to your business. Now
- [18:49] notice, of course, over time these
- [18:50] results will be personalized to you as
- [18:53] it kind of gains a more understanding of
- [18:54] what you like, what you like to listen
- [18:56] to. I'm going to say, what are the top
- [18:57] AI podcasts on Spotify? not episodes but
- [19:00] actual podcasts. By the way, the
- [19:02] documentation for all this stuff is
- [19:03] available at opening.com. So, if I don't
- [19:06] forget, I'll put this link in the
- [19:08] description, but this is called
- [19:09] introducing apps in ChadBt. Here it will
- [19:12] tell you what you need to do to get your
- [19:15] app listed and also they have some
- [19:17] guidelines for discoverability. So, like
- [19:19] what do you do to make sure that your
- [19:21] app gets called more often? Now, why is
- [19:23] this important? Is it just traffic,
- [19:25] exposure, etc.? Well, not quite. There's
- [19:28] a little bit more coming. As you see
- [19:30] here, they're saying we'll also share
- [19:32] details on monetization soon, including
- [19:34] support for the new agentic commerce
- [19:36] protocol, an open standard enables
- [19:38] instant checkout in Chad GBT. Notice
- [19:41] both Google and opening at this point.
- [19:44] They're building that kind of like
- [19:45] e-commerce more refers to like shopping.
- [19:47] This is bigger than that. That's sort of
- [19:49] this monetary layer, this this
- [19:51] transaction layer on the internet that
- [19:53] can be used by agents to buy services
- [19:56] and engage in various activities.
- [19:58] Interestingly, Google, as we've covered
- [20:00] in a recent video, they've partnered up
- [20:02] with Coinbase to handle the crypto side
- [20:05] of those transactions, but they also
- [20:07] have their own agent to agent payment
- [20:09] protocol. And OpenI, of course, is
- [20:12] building out their own side of it,
- [20:14] right? So, buy it in Chad GPT, Instant
- [20:16] Checkout, Agentic Commerce Protocol, and
- [20:18] they're already partnering up with
- [20:20] giants like Walmart and also Shopify.
- [20:23] Shopify is huge. If you're a massive
- [20:26] retailer online like Amazon, you sort of
- [20:28] you have your own custom platform that
- [20:30] you build. For a lot of other companies,
- [20:32] including some rather large companies,
- [20:35] they use Shopify. I've been doing
- [20:36] e-commerce for a while. Shopify is is
- [20:39] very good. There's some alternatives on
- [20:41] WordPress which is open source which is
- [20:43] nice but I'm guessing Shopify just
- [20:45] dominates. So according to this chart,
- [20:47] Shopify has 4.65
- [20:50] million worldwide e-commerce stores.
- [20:53] It's one of the biggest platforms
- [20:54] although some other statistics show it
- [20:56] as not being the biggest with Woo
- [20:58] Commerce being the biggest. So for
- [20:59] example e-commerce usage distribution in
- [21:01] the top 1 million sites. So Shopify is
- [21:04] 20% which is still huge, right? With Woo
- [21:07] Commerce that's the WordPress more. It's
- [21:10] on top of WordPress. That one is 27%.
- [21:12] Oh, it looks like Shopify Plus is
- [21:14] another 3%. So it's a little bit larger
- [21:16] than that. The reason I bring that up is
- [21:17] because a lot of this is getting
- [21:19] integrated right into Chad GPT. So apps,
- [21:22] checkouts, search, everything. And you
- [21:25] know, some smart guy or gal will figure
- [21:28] out how to make millions or billions
- [21:31] with this by being one of the early
- [21:32] movers. So, I believe it said that
- [21:34] Spotify was added September 2nd, I think
- [21:37] it did. So, this app, the ability to
- [21:38] connect this app was added, you know,
- [21:40] not that long ago. By the way, as this
- [21:43] grows, you know, other podcasting shows,
- [21:45] other companies will want to be on this.
- [21:48] So, we're very early on. This might be a
- [21:50] good time to poke around and see how
- [21:52] things work. One other bit of news, this
- [21:54] is from the information.com called
- [21:56] OpenAI's growing ecosystem play. So, as
- [21:59] we talked about, Chad GBT is going to
- [22:01] have apps in Chad GBT. So, you can
- [22:03] search for homes on Zillow or make
- [22:05] Spotify playlists. OpenI's goal is to
- [22:08] have a signin with Chad GPT just like
- [22:10] you have signin with Google or Apple or
- [22:13] whatever. And this might be very
- [22:15] interesting to startups that want to use
- [22:17] AI powered features provided by OpenAI.
- [22:20] The interesting thing here is that for
- [22:23] certain products, this would allow the
- [22:25] customer to sign into a product like
- [22:28] cursor or some AI coding assistant and
- [22:30] it's the customer's account that would
- [22:32] power that app basically paying for the
- [22:36] open eyes API usage. So if I use my
- [22:39] chatbt account to log into cursor for
- [22:42] example then whatever I do in cursor if
- [22:44] that incurs any cost in terms of
- [22:46] generating tokens through openai I would
- [22:48] pay that through my own account. That's
- [22:50] in the case if you're using something
- [22:52] like an API. This article doesn't talk
- [22:55] about that. They're specifically talking
- [22:56] about like if you have a pro account you
- [22:58] let's say have 10 queries with GPT5 that
- [23:01] you can run. So if you were to log into
- [23:03] another app, that app would be able to
- [23:06] use those queries on your behalf. So
- [23:08] instead of the app paying for that
- [23:10] service, it would be paid by sort of
- [23:12] your account or at least offset by the
- [23:15] 10 quote unquote free queries that you
- [23:17] have. I hope that makes sense. So
- [23:18] basically, you're using your account and
- [23:20] its capacity, how many queries you're
- [23:23] able to run against it to sort of
- [23:24] subsidize the app and what they're doing
- [23:26] on your behalf if you choose to log into
- [23:29] that app through ChadBt. I'm sure I
- [23:31] completely butchered explaining that. So
- [23:33] here's a picture of Sam Alman if it
- [23:36] helps. And in other news, Thermo Fisher
- [23:38] and OpenAI collab to accelerate drug
- [23:40] development through AI integration. So
- [23:43] this is interesting because of course
- [23:44] Google DeepMind is doing a lot in that
- [23:47] field with Alphafold and various other
- [23:50] AI models. Recently they had a massive
- [23:53] medical breakthrough, brand new ground
- [23:56] AI assisted discovery. We will cover
- [23:58] that in a different video because that
- [24:00] deserves its own separate video because
- [24:02] it seems kind of huge. So, Thermo Fisher
- [24:06] announced a landmark collab with OpenAI
- [24:08] today to embed advanced artificial
- [24:10] intelligence across its clinical trials
- [24:12] business, aiming to accelerate drug
- [24:14] discovery, simplify the research
- [24:17] process, and get medicines to patients
- [24:19] faster and cheaper. That's it in a
- [24:21] nutshell. The rest of the article just
- [24:23] repeats that same thing in many
- [24:26] different ways. So, it's kind of hard to
- [24:28] tell how huge this is. Is it just like,
- [24:31] oh, the employees, the doctors, the
- [24:34] researchers now have access to Chad GPT
- [24:36] or some specific slightly tweaked
- [24:39] version of it or this is something
- [24:40] greater? It's hard to tell so far just
- [24:42] from this. Of course, in other news,
- [24:44] Walmart has announced a major
- [24:46] partnership with OpenAI to build AI
- [24:48] first shopping experiences directly into
- [24:50] Chad GBT. You'll be able to shop Walmart
- [24:52] Sam's Club using instant checkout.
- [24:54] Wouldn't it be funny if Sam Alman at
- [24:56] some point just opening I grow so much
- [24:58] that it takes over Walmart and he would
- [25:00] change Walmart to Alt Mart and Sam's
- [25:03] Club to I'm still Sam's Club. I don't
- [25:06] really care either way. I shop at
- [25:07] Costco. And they're saying that the move
- [25:09] shifts the model from reactive search to
- [25:11] Agentic Commerce that predicts and plans
- [25:13] shopping needs. This is where it could
- [25:15] get kind of weird obviously, right?
- [25:17] Because if there's some sort of a
- [25:19] commercial pressure to push certain
- [25:21] products, your favorite AI chatbot might
- [25:24] be forced to just pitch you various crap
- [25:27] you don't need. Again, I mean, there's a
- [25:29] right and a wrong way to go about that.
- [25:32] Let me know what your gut feeling is. Do
- [25:34] you think this is going to be handled
- [25:35] smart and with the consumer in mind or
- [25:38] foolishly with the profit margins in
- [25:41] mind? Sora 2 is wildly successful.
- [25:44] 56,000 downloads in the first day of
- [25:47] release. Then you had 164,000 times in
- [25:51] the first two days. Keep in mind it's
- [25:53] invite only. So they they do have that
- [25:56] kind of scarcity built in and that might
- [25:59] be part of the magic that's driving
- [26:00] this. Now Sam Alman is aware of this
- [26:03] idea that Chad PT must never trade trust
- [26:06] for ad dollars. So certainly that's been
- [26:09] a concern for me. I tend to nowadays
- [26:11] rely on Chad PT for research. If the
- [26:15] quality gets worse because somebody's
- [26:17] trying to pitch me some product, number
- [26:19] one, I'll lose a very valuable resource,
- [26:22] trust with that company with Chad GBT
- [26:25] will be broken. I'm hoping the other AI
- [26:27] companies will have enough pressure
- [26:29] there to kind of like it won't make
- [26:31] sense for one of them to just cash in
- [26:34] because we'll have other options, right?
- [26:36] So, if there's Grock and Gemini,
- [26:38] Anthropic and Chad, you know what? If if
- [26:41] one of them is ruining their trust by
- [26:44] just pushing ads in front of people, we
- [26:46] can go somewhere else. But it almost
- [26:48] does feel like the internet as we have
- [26:52] known it all this time is going away,
- [26:54] getting replaced by AI. Instead of
- [26:56] browsing, we have our agents go out
- [26:58] there and do things for us. Instead of
- [27:00] searching, we run whatever GPT5 Pro or
- [27:03] whatever you're using to do that
- [27:05] research. Will Sor 2 be more popular
- [27:08] than Tik Tok and YouTube Shorts and
- [27:10] Instagram? We'll see. I'm not quite sure
- [27:13] where that one's going, although it's
- [27:15] been pretty popular so far. So, we'll
- [27:17] see if that sort of fades away, the
- [27:19] novelty fades away, or it just
- [27:20] continues. And according to Epic AI,
- [27:23] Open AI is experiencing one of the
- [27:25] fastest revenue growth rates in
- [27:27] corporate history with annualized
- [27:28] revenue rising 3x a year from 2 billion
- [27:31] at the end of 2023 to 13 billion by
- [27:35] August 2025. So there's revenue growth.
- [27:38] A lot of these large massive companies
- [27:41] that have more cash than some nations,
- [27:44] they're pouring in a lot of money into
- [27:46] these various deals and building out
- [27:49] data centers. And while some people are
- [27:51] convinced that we're at the peak of the
- [27:53] bubble, this train doesn't seem to be
- [27:56] slowing down. So, either we're just
- [27:58] picking up speed or we're about to go
- [28:00] off the rails. Let me know what you
- [28:02] think. Leave a comment down below. Thank
- [28:04] you so much for watching. My name is Wes
- [28:06] Roth. See you in the next
