- [00:00] quick announcement that I'm super
- [00:01] excited for. This Sunday, October 26th,
- [00:04] at 11:00 a.m. Central time, I'm doing my
- [00:06] first ever live AI agent build as a live
- [00:10] stream. All my other streams in the past
- [00:12] have been more focused on Q&A. I did
- [00:14] something kind of similar with NAND in
- [00:16] the past, but this is the real deal.
- [00:19] Building a complete AI agent and using
- [00:21] AI coding assistance. And if you're
- [00:23] watching this after the stream already
- [00:25] happened, no worries. I'll have a link
- [00:26] to the recording in the description. And
- [00:28] not only will I be showing you how to
- [00:30] use AI coding assistance to build any AI
- [00:32] agent, I also have an awesome use case
- [00:35] for our stream. I teased recently that
- [00:38] I'm working on this AI agent that I'll
- [00:40] be showing how I build on my YouTube
- [00:42] channel. It's your own personal AI
- [00:44] coach. So, it's an AI agent with a lot
- [00:46] of advanced rag techniques that's
- [00:48] trained on all of my YouTube content. I
- [00:51] want to extend that to more than just
- [00:53] YouTube later as well. And so it's a
- [00:55] really practical agent to be a resource
- [00:57] alongside all of my YouTube content. And
- [01:00] we're going to be building this from the
- [01:01] ground up together, which I'm just so
- [01:03] excited for. So link in the description
- [01:05] to the live stream. Go over there,
- [01:07] enable notifications for it. Again,
- [01:09] that's this Sunday, the 26th, at 11:00
- [01:11] a.m. Central time. Building our personal
- [01:13] AI coach for both AI agents and AI
- [01:16] coding assistants because that's what I
- [01:18] cover on my channel. And this is going
- [01:19] to be trained on my YouTube content to
- [01:22] start. And then I want to expand the
- [01:23] knowledge base over time to include
- [01:25] other sources as well. So I got big
- [01:27] plans for this agent, but I want to
- [01:29] build it with you live. I think that's
- [01:30] going to be so exciting. And so there
- [01:32] are four core technologies that we're
- [01:35] going to be focusing on in the live
- [01:36] stream. So just giving you a little bit
- [01:38] of a teaser for what's coming as we
- [01:40] build this together. And so starting
- [01:42] with YouTube, this is obviously going to
- [01:44] be the primary data source for our rag
- [01:47] pipeline. So, we'll build a simple yet
- [01:49] effective rag pipeline together for
- [01:51] ingesting YouTube videos and we'll
- [01:54] include the extraction of metadata and
- [01:56] timestamps. Like, it's not going to be
- [01:57] extremely trivial and we're going to do
- [01:59] that so we can have more advanced rag
- [02:01] tools that I'll talk about in a sec. And
- [02:03] this is going to work for any YouTube
- [02:04] channel. So, theoretically, this agent
- [02:06] that I build, you could turn it into an
- [02:08] expert for really any content creator.
- [02:11] Pretty cool. And for the AI agent
- [02:13] framework, we're going to obviously be
- [02:14] building in Python. That's what I always
- [02:16] cover on my channel. And Pyantic AI is
- [02:19] still my favorite AI agent framework and
- [02:22] it has been for quite a while. And we'll
- [02:24] be giving our Pyantic AI agent a few
- [02:26] different rag tools to query YouTube
- [02:28] videos. And I'm going to make it so that
- [02:30] it's going to work for really any large
- [02:32] language model. So we'll be able to use
- [02:33] Open Router, Olama, Anthropic, OpenAI,
- [02:36] all these different providers. I want to
- [02:38] be very LLM agnostic and I'll be
- [02:40] focusing a lot on the tools that I give
- [02:43] to the agent because I want to apply
- [02:45] some more advanced rag strategies to
- [02:47] make that a really practical part of the
- [02:49] stream as well. So applying different
- [02:51] strategies for ultra accurate retrieval
- [02:54] and even giving the agent to pull
- [02:56] transcripts if it needs. So it's more
- [02:58] like an agentic rag solution where the
- [03:00] agent gets to reason about how it
- [03:02] searches through the YouTube transcripts
- [03:04] and we'll have token streaming with a
- [03:06] complete front end. like this is going
- [03:07] to be a full stack application that I've
- [03:10] got in store for you. And speaking of
- [03:12] full stack, for our database, we will be
- [03:14] using a superbase. And so this will be
- [03:17] where we store all of our YouTube
- [03:18] videos, including the transcripts and
- [03:20] the embeddings that we have for rag and
- [03:22] then metadata as well for more advanced
- [03:25] rag techniques. being able to do
- [03:26] metadata filtering and things like that
- [03:28] to make sure that our rag solution can
- [03:30] be very precise and then authentication
- [03:33] for our front-end application because I
- [03:35] do want to make this something that is
- [03:36] deployed to the cloud ready for you,
- [03:38] anyone viewing my YouTube videos to
- [03:40] leverage at some point. And so obviously
- [03:42] you'll need authentication for that. And
- [03:44] then last but not least, something I
- [03:45] covered pretty recently on my channel is
- [03:47] a tool for rag called Dockling. And this
- [03:50] is especially useful for the hybrid
- [03:52] chunking that they have available. So,
- [03:55] more on this when we build with Dockling
- [03:58] together in a couple of days here. But
- [04:00] this chunking strategy is actually going
- [04:02] to be super critical for accurate rag
- [04:04] for a YouTube transcript. So, we'll be
- [04:06] using Dockling for that local models so
- [04:08] everything is blazing fast and later I
- [04:10] can extend this to support uploading
- [04:12] PDFs for when I expand the different
- [04:14] sources for the knowledge base. So,
- [04:16] that's everything going into this agent.
- [04:18] So, it's going to be super practical,
- [04:20] super hands-on. It's going to be pretty
- [04:21] casual and engaging as well, like I
- [04:23] always like to make my live streams.
- [04:25] It's going to be a blast. And the goal
- [04:26] that I have for you, the primary goal is
- [04:29] to give you a super straightforward
- [04:31] example of building a pretty practical
- [04:34] AI agent. I hope this seems really
- [04:36] practical to you and it's going to be
- [04:38] using a full AI coding assistant
- [04:40] workflow. So, of course, we're going to
- [04:41] be using AI coding assistants. I'll use
- [04:43] claude code in the stream, but I'll talk
- [04:45] about how this will work with really any
- [04:47] AI coding assistant. And then for task
- [04:49] management and rag, we're going to use
- [04:51] the good old archon because this is my
- [04:53] open source tool that I have available
- [04:54] for you to enhance any AI coding
- [04:57] workflow. So of course, I wouldn't miss
- [04:59] including it in everything that we've
- [05:01] got right now. And by the way, a massive
- [05:03] reason that I'm doing this live stream
- [05:05] is cuz I want to celebrate the release
- [05:07] of the Agentic coding course in Dynamis.
- [05:10] So, I'll have a link to this in the
- [05:11] description as well, so you can check it
- [05:13] out because if you want to master AI
- [05:16] coding assistance and learn how to build
- [05:18] reliable, repeatable systems that get
- [05:21] you results you didn't even know was
- [05:23] possible with AI coding assistance. This
- [05:25] is for you. I promise you're not going
- [05:27] to find anything better. And you got to
- [05:29] understand, I have to tell you about
- [05:30] this right now because the first batch
- [05:32] of the course was released right into
- [05:34] the Dynamis community literally today.
- [05:36] So, it's on the forefront of my mind.
- [05:38] I'm super excited for this. We're going
- [05:40] to be releasing the course in batches to
- [05:41] the community over the next month and
- [05:44] having live workshops to go along with
- [05:46] these releases. So, it's going to be
- [05:48] super engaging. I just released the
- [05:50] module about the core mental models of
- [05:52] AI coding and principles. Then, we'll
- [05:54] get into building your own system that
- [05:57] is optimized for your use case and your
- [05:59] code bases. And then getting into how
- [06:01] you can automate your workflows,
- [06:03] integrate with your applications. We'll
- [06:05] even get into more advanced things like
- [06:06] remote AI coding. And then finally
- [06:08] getting into some more out-of-the-box
- [06:10] solutions that you can leverage and
- [06:11] learn from to build your systems like
- [06:13] the PRP framework, the BMAD method, and
- [06:15] the GitHub spec kit. So really covering
- [06:18] the full landscape for AI coding and
- [06:20] taking your systems to a level that is
- [06:23] just probably unimaginable for you right
- [06:25] now. And the core mental model that I
- [06:27] cover here is that every mistake is an
- [06:30] opportunity to evolve your system. So
- [06:32] when AI screws up something in your
- [06:34] code, instead of just fixing it
- [06:36] yourself, you fix your system and retry.
- [06:39] And when you iterate on this over and
- [06:41] over again, you end up with this system
- [06:43] that is perfectly crafted for you. And
- [06:46] that really is your competitive
- [06:47] advantage. So definitely check out the
- [06:50] Dynamus Aentic coding course. But with
- [06:52] that, back to the main announcement for
- [06:54] this video for the live stream. Again,
- [06:56] that is this Sunday, the 26th, at 11:00
- [06:58] a.m. Central time. It's going to be
- [07:00] super practical, super fun, and we're
- [07:02] building something that's going to be an
- [07:03] incredible resource for the channel
- [07:05] going forward. And so with that, I will
- [07:07] see you this Sunday for the first ever
- [07:10] live agent
