- [00:00] I've been playing with mCP integration
- [00:02] into AI coding IDE for the past few days
- [00:05] it has totally changed my workflow and
- [00:07] boost my productivity so my cursor not
- [00:09] only generate codes but also calling
- [00:11] text to image model to generate all the
- [00:13] gaming assets that is needed for
- [00:15] developing the game that you're seeing
- [00:17] here and not only that when there bugs
- [00:18] my cursor also looking to console log
- [00:20] and network request to debug Arrow it
- [00:22] can even read my superbase database
- [00:24] directly and doing internet search
- [00:26] looking to my figma file all those
- [00:28] thanks to the mCP server function so
- [00:30] today I will take you through what is
- [00:31] mCP how can you integrate existing mcps
- [00:34] that other people already created as
- [00:36] well as the easiest way to set up your
- [00:38] own mCP server in just few minutes for
- [00:40] people who are watching this video you
- [00:42] probably more or less heard about mCP
- [00:44] which is a modo context protocol
- [00:45] introduced by entropic last year it
- [00:47] basically provide a universal interface
- [00:49] for people to connect their agent to
- [00:51] allour different data source and
- [00:53] external systems you can think of mCP
- [00:55] like a USBC port for all sorts of
- [00:57] different air applications just like
- [00:58] USBC provides standardized way to
- [01:00] connect your device to also different
- [01:01] accessories mCP provides standardized
- [01:03] ways to connect AI model to different
- [01:05] data source and external system what's
- [01:07] really interesting is AI coding has
- [01:08] evolved a lot for the past few months
- [01:10] from initially just a chat co-pilot to
- [01:12] composer that can create a fil to
- [01:14] nowadays all the modern a ID like cursor
- [01:16] and window server or build powerful
- [01:18] agents that can do some plannings and
- [01:19] take a lot of different type of actions
- [01:21] at default cursor coding agents we have
- [01:23] a list of actions that can take but what
- [01:25] if you wanted to do more that's where
- [01:27] the mCP comes in you can build all sorts
- [01:29] of different COs in inations so that
- [01:30] cursor can access almost whatever you
- [01:32] want they really change the game for AI
- [01:33] codings mCP can be used for many
- [01:35] different scenarios for example some of
- [01:37] mCP server might be just prompts where
- [01:40] the agent can just call certain mCP like
- [01:42] analyze code and it will return a proper
- [01:44] user message with specific prompt that
- [01:46] can guide the agent behavior for next
- [01:48] actions but on the outs side mCP can
- [01:50] also be used to connect to different
- [01:52] external Resource as well as assistance
- [01:54] to calling different API and point when
- [01:56] you look at entropic mCP doc it is
- [01:58] fairly complicated and not exactly clear
- [02:00] how can you install and create your own
- [02:02] mCP very easily that's why today I want
- [02:04] to take you through some of my favorite
- [02:06] mCP as well as the easiest way to build
- [02:08] your own mCP that can connect your
- [02:09] cursor into any source of system you
- [02:11] want so without further Ado let's get it
- [02:13] there are a few Marketplace already
- [02:14] existed they show you a list of mCP that
- [02:16] other people have created that you can
- [02:17] use from gl. a SMI cursor. directory as
- [02:21] well ASM systems where they have hosted
- [02:23] mCP server that you can use and the way
- [02:25] you can use those platform is that you
- [02:26] can search for the mcpu that you want to
- [02:28] use for example if I I want to add a
- [02:30] sequential thinking mCP which is type of
- [02:32] mCP that will force agent to think
- [02:34] through a few different steps and do
- [02:35] some plannings I can choose a ID that
- [02:37] I'm using in this case a recursor and I
- [02:39] can just copy this command line over go
- [02:40] to my cursor select feature and in the
- [02:42] mCP server I can click on ADD mCP I can
- [02:45] give a name and the name here didn't
- [02:47] really matter I can just call it
- [02:48] sequential thinking and there are two
- [02:49] different types you can choose in most
- [02:51] cases for now you'll probably choose
- [02:52] command which means it will run a local
- [02:54] command to call the server but if you're
- [02:56] using some host mCP server then you can
- [02:58] choose SS but most of the time it is
- [03:00] almost always command so we can add this
- [03:02] and click add the botton you will see
- [03:03] that this is a new mCP server added
- [03:05] called sequential syncing and this is
- [03:06] one two called sequential sying so what
- [03:09] I can do is that we can start a new chat
- [03:11] with agent and just give a prompt I want
- [03:13] to build a game now let's plan it using
- [03:15] sequential syncing don't generate any
- [03:17] code yet and then you will be prompt to
- [03:19] call this mCP server and for this
- [03:21] specific tool if you open it you can see
- [03:22] that it is basically trying to use
- [03:23] function call to force agent generate
- [03:25] multiple different sorts it is counting
- [03:27] how many sorts that you need to do in
- [03:28] total and the next s needed will be true
- [03:30] which means if I finish this it will try
- [03:32] to continue doing another s repeat this
- [03:34] process for probably eight times if you
- [03:36] want you can also turn on this YOLO mode
- [03:38] which means you don't need to approve
- [03:39] every single time but I would suggest
- [03:41] you to do the manual one first but to
- [03:43] make something more interesting you can
- [03:44] also search for a r mCP and one thing to
- [03:47] not is that currently there's no
- [03:49] standardized way to install or set up
- [03:51] mcps each mCP is kind of set up
- [03:53] differently and the quality of mcps on
- [03:55] those websites are also quite unstable
- [03:58] many of them didn't really work at all
- [04:00] and this makes adoption a lot harder but
- [04:01] I will show you a few example of common
- [04:03] ways to install those mcps basic I want
- [04:05] to find command line to use sometimes
- [04:07] they will provide MPX package D which
- [04:09] you can copy and start using but quite
- [04:11] often you will have problem that it
- [04:13] didn't really work for example if I copy
- [04:15] this one and add a mCP server Reddit MC
- [04:18] you might see that this mCP has no tool
- [04:20] available which means you can't do
- [04:22] anything with it but you might also say
- [04:23] Json like this and for this one you
- [04:25] basically need to convert them into a
- [04:26] single line command which in this case
- [04:28] will be the uvx from git link here mCP
- [04:32] Reddit and you can of separate them out
- [04:34] with space so I can copy this and add a
- [04:35] new server called it redit command and
- [04:38] paste in you can see that this has been
- [04:41] added with two tools fetch Reddit hot
- [04:43] strats and fetch Reddit post content and
- [04:45] we can give a try what are some latest
- [04:48] hot content on Reddit it will try to
- [04:50] call this mcp2 F Reddit hot Strat and if
- [04:53] I click accept you can see it return
- [04:55] some of the content from reddits so this
- [04:58] is basically how you can use those
- [04:59] existing platform to find mCP that you
- [05:01] might be able to use but one really
- [05:02] annoying thing of using other people's
- [05:04] mCP at the moment is that even though
- [05:06] there are mCP directories many of those
- [05:08] mcps didn't actually work or it is very
- [05:11] complicated to set up with incomplete
- [05:13] documents I spent quite a lot of time
- [05:14] testing different mcps and future down
- [05:16] list of mcps that's both useful and
- [05:18] useable I'll share this list in the AI
- [05:20] Builder Club Community and building and
- [05:22] I'll continue sharing new interesting
- [05:23] mCP I found so if you're interested you
- [05:25] can click on the link below to join my
- [05:27] community but what I want to show you is
- [05:29] a few MC that I personally use a lot
- [05:31] that really boost my productivity and
- [05:32] the first mCP I want to introduce is
- [05:34] browser tools this mCP that give your
- [05:36] cursor access to your browser console
- [05:38] log and network tabs directly so that
- [05:41] they can run your app debugging much
- [05:42] easier and also allow you to communicate
- [05:44] with cursor about specific element that
- [05:46] you want to change on the you firstly
- [05:48] you will need to clone their Chrome
- [05:49] plugin so you can either run the command
- [05:50] line get clone or you can use GitHub
- [05:52] desktop app and clone this specific
- [05:54] Ripple and once it's done you can click
- [05:56] on the settings in your Chrome extension
- [05:58] and click on load on compact then choose
- [06:00] Chrome extension folder from the browser
- [06:02] 2 mCP folder as you see the browser 2
- [06:04] mCP show up here and next we want to add
- [06:07] mCP server to cursor you click on
- [06:09] settings feature mCP server and just
- [06:11] give a name browser tools and the type
- [06:13] we choose command here we're need to
- [06:15] copy this and paste in you can see it
- [06:17] has list of tools from get console logs
- [06:19] console Arrow Network Arrow screenshots
- [06:22] as well as select element and the last
- [06:23] step is that we want to run the browser
- [06:25] to mCP server so you can just open
- [06:27] Terminal in any directory to MP X at
- [06:30] agentes browser to server and then this
- [06:32] server is running now if you go to any
- [06:34] web page and open inspector you can see
- [06:36] at top there have bar called browser 2
- [06:38] mCP is debugging the browser which means
- [06:41] you can actually go to cursor in agent
- [06:43] mode just ask what's in my console lck
- [06:45] and it will run this get console log to
- [06:47] it'll be able to see all the console
- [06:48] logs you have and also check if there's
- [06:50] any arrow in console L apart from
- [06:52] reading the console and network logs it
- [06:54] also has cool features like guest L
- [06:56] Elements which means you can go to your
- [06:58] web browser right click in back so in
- [07:00] here we select this specific element and
- [07:02] then I can give prompt update only the
- [07:04] style of element I choose in the browser
- [07:06] right now to something fancier that
- [07:08] looks like a real poket car then it will
- [07:09] run this function called guest L element
- [07:12] and return a specific diff and from
- [07:13] there it identify it is car component
- [07:15] and update that specific component and
- [07:17] this is kind of fairly simple example
- [07:19] but you can imagine for more complex
- [07:21] applications this will allow you to
- [07:23] communicate with cursor much easier and
- [07:24] one of the coolest thing that mCP allow
- [07:26] you to do is connect to any other
- [07:28] service to enhance your cursor workflow
- [07:30] for example what if cursor can call text
- [07:31] to image model to generate all sorts of
- [07:33] gaming assets like the background image
- [07:35] and this is where you can create custom
- [07:37] mCP server to connect any sort of
- [07:39] service and here you can see I actually
- [07:40] create my own mCP server with one of
- [07:43] function called generate image so what I
- [07:45] would do is I take a screenshot of how
- [07:46] the game looks like right now help me
- [07:48] generate different images of dogs for
- [07:50] cards instead of emoji and click submit
- [07:53] and then it will call this function to
- [07:55] generate a image and it will return one
- [07:58] and it will try to generate a few
- [08:01] more all right so it generate a few
- [08:03] different image so we have this new game
- [08:05] called poy memory game and if you click
- [08:08] on each one of them you can see that
- [08:10] they are unique image that generated by
- [08:13] the AI model and all those image are
- [08:15] actually coordinated by cursor itself
- [08:18] which is absolutely amazing and even
- [08:20] though setting up mCP server does sounds
- [08:22] like a lot of work when you look at mCP
- [08:24] doc but it's actually not that
- [08:26] complicated and you can use cloud flat
- [08:28] where they provide a worker and mCP that
- [08:30] basically give you the boy play of the
- [08:31] mCP server you just need to build
- [08:33] function yourself and I'm going to
- [08:35] quickly show you how you can do that so
- [08:36] I'm going to create a new folder with
- [08:38] command line mpm create Cloud flare at
- [08:42] latest so this one we set up a cloud
- [08:44] flare project I will just name it my mCP
- [08:47] and the example I will choose hell word
- [08:49] and Hell World worker and language I
- [08:51] will choose typescript and do we want to
- [08:54] use git for the version of course we
- [08:56] want and do we want to deploy for this
- [08:58] one I'm going to choose use no but if
- [09:00] you want you can also deploy it to use
- [09:02] on other server or even share with
- [09:03] others later cool the next step is our
- [09:05] CD my mCP which is folder name and then
- [09:08] do mpm so you can just paste this in if
- [09:11] you restart Cloud you should be able to
- [09:13] see a little toy icon show up here where
- [09:16] it include all the functions that we
- [09:18] have defined in those example file but
- [09:20] if you want to activate this mCP for
- [09:22] cursor what you will do is that you will
- [09:24] put the command of this one space this
- [09:26] one and this one and putting that
- [09:28] together for my specific examp example I
- [09:30] would just put this command line into
- [09:32] cursor's mCP so I can add a new mCP and
- [09:35] my mCP type will be command and paste
- [09:38] that in and add you can see this tool
- [09:40] has been added successfully and here is
- [09:43] one tool called say hello if you open
- [09:45] your mCP folder and select indexs this
- [09:49] as we mentioned before is where you're
- [09:50] going to store all the functions so here
- [09:52] you can see this one function called say
- [09:53] hello so the thing above is how we
- [09:56] communicate when to use this tool the
- [09:58] inputs and expand output format and here
- [10:00] we have one function of say hello so
- [10:03] what we can do is that we can open
- [10:05] cursor or just say say hello for workers
- [10:09] mCP server for me and now you can see it
- [10:12] tried to call this tool called say hello
- [10:14] and it return this result which is what
- [10:16] you define here this is a very basic mCP
- [10:19] function but you can imagine now you can
- [10:21] write whatever function you want conect
- [10:23] to external API service or even run
- [10:25] local models directly and this is
- [10:27] exactly how I write mCP to call image
- [10:29] generation model post down replicate I
- [10:31] can just choose the API service I can
- [10:33] just copy the code example open cursor
- [10:35] paste in and give prom help me write a
- [10:37] new function that will generate image
- [10:39] using a model host down replicate don't
- [10:41] use any environment variable just put
- [10:43] variable inside index.ts directly uh so
- [10:46] this is not best practice but because
- [10:47] cursor mCP unfortunately didn't allow
- [10:50] you to set up environment variable very
- [10:52] easily so we have to set the environment
- [10:54] variable inside the file direct lay and
- [10:56] I will also give some additional prompt
- [10:58] the replicate API return a prediction
- [11:00] object that needs to be pulled for
- [11:02] completion not an immediate result and
- [11:04] making sure pass result poply so this
- [11:07] just some a common mistake I saw L model
- [11:09] often make with replicate API aut box
- [11:11] okay I'll click accept and at top we
- [11:14] need to put the API key here and here
- [11:16] you can see that it generate new
- [11:17] function with description generate image
- [11:19] using recraft V3 model and with two
- [11:23] input param prompt and size and return
- [11:26] the URL of gener image once it's
- [11:28] finished I do PM round deploy this word
- [11:30] deploys again and just for testing
- [11:32] purpose I will use cloud to just quickly
- [11:34] test it so I will close cloud and open
- [11:37] Cloud again just quickly check the
- [11:38] generate image is here so I say help me
- [11:41] generate an image of Doc Val
- [11:46] AI allow for this chat and I got an
- [11:48] arrow saying fail to start image
- [11:50] generation the specific version didn't
- [11:52] exist I think it is using the wrong URL
- [11:55] for some reason so I'm just going to
- [11:58] copy this in again make sure you use the
- [12:01] right URL and write inputs just like
- [12:05] above code example okay once it's
- [12:08] finished we can do npm R deploy to
- [12:10] deploy the latest version and I'm going
- [12:11] to restart Cloud to say help me generate
- [12:14] a dog image well the reason I use cloud
- [12:17] is because I don't want to keep restart
- [12:20] my cursor it's just a bit easier but you
- [12:21] don't have to you can also just testing
- [12:23] cursor directly okay so you can see that
- [12:26] it return this message of the image URL
- [12:29] generated if I open that link it will
- [12:30] show me this image generation so this
- [12:32] how you can connect any sorts of
- [12:33] functionalities and external assistant
- [12:35] to your cursor I'm really excited to see
- [12:37] what kind of things you're going to come
- [12:38] up with and most annoying thing about
- [12:40] mCP now is that many of them just kind
- [12:42] of don't work out of box it's almost
- [12:45] easier to build your own so I spent
- [12:47] quite a few time to like test different
- [12:48] mCP server choose the ones that I use a
- [12:51] lot and I'm putting the AI build club
- [12:53] and building so if you're interested you
- [12:55] can click on the link below to join the
- [12:56] community where I will be maintaining a
- [12:58] list of high quality mCP that I found is
- [13:00] extremely useful for AI coding as well
- [13:02] as some custom ones that I develop
- [13:04] myself you can click the link in the
- [13:05] description below to join my community I
- [13:08] hope you enjoy this content if you enjoy
- [13:10] please comment below I'll post more in
- [13:11] depth tutorial about mcps in AI coding
- [13:14] thank you and I see you next time
