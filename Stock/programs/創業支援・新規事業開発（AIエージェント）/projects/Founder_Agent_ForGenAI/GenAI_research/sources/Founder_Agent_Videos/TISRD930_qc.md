- [00:00] These days, AI can almost do anything.
- [00:03] It can help you code out fullon
- [00:05] applications autonomously. You can run
- [00:07] deep research on complex concepts,
- [00:10] automate workflows, and even control
- [00:12] your browser like a real digital worker.
- [00:14] But the truth is simple. Nothing brings
- [00:17] all these abilities together in one
- [00:19] place. Nothing acts as a single agent
- [00:21] that can think, [music] build, research,
- [00:23] and execute to keep working long after
- [00:26] you've logged off. Now, imagine an AI
- [00:29] that does exactly all of that. An agent
- [00:32] that can build full-on applications,
- [00:34] perform multi-step tasks on the web,
- [00:36] write detailed reports, automate your
- [00:39] computer, and even run on its own
- [00:41] schedule with background chron jobs. It
- [00:44] wakes up, browses the internet, gathers
- [00:46] new data, updates dashboards, refreshes
- [00:49] intelligence, and triggers actions
- [00:51] completely on its own. That is exactly
- [00:54] what Deep Agent by Abacus AI can do. An
- [00:58] all-in-one autonomous AI agent system
- [01:01] that works like a full team, operates
- [01:04] 24/7, and handles everything without
- [01:06] lifting a single finger. Just take a
- [01:08] look at this demo where Deep Agent was
- [01:10] asked to build a fullon live dashboard
- [01:13] for verified startup funding news. It
- [01:15] generated the entire dashboard where it
- [01:17] created the backend to pull data from
- [01:19] trusted sources and deployed autonomous
- [01:22] scraping agents to gather information.
- [01:24] It is then scheduling these background
- [01:26] agents to refresh task so that the
- [01:29] dashboard stays upto-date with
- [01:31] information on a daily basis where it
- [01:33] finds funding news on a recursive
- [01:36] 24-hour basis that runs automatically
- [01:39] and keeps itself updated without any
- [01:41] manual work. Here is another example of
- [01:43] deep agent in action. This one is pretty
- [01:44] wild cuz it is where it is automating a
- [01:47] full-on browserbased workflow. It was
- [01:50] prompted to manage the invoices from
- [01:52] multiple sources and condense the
- [01:54] information into a Google sheet. E page
- [01:56] handled the entire process of navigating
- [01:59] the entire site, collecting the
- [02:01] invoices, extracting the key details and
- [02:04] adding them into a clean, organized
- [02:06] sheet. It even generated a dashboard to
- [02:08] visualize the data that was sent into a
- [02:11] breakdown email through Gmail. Finally,
- [02:14] it updated the Google sheet with a
- [02:15] summarized view of all the invoice
- [02:17] totals and the entire workflow ran end
- [02:20] to end with no manual step needed.
- [02:22] Before we get started, I just want to
- [02:24] mention that you should definitely go
- [02:25] ahead and subscribe to the world of AI
- [02:28] newsletter. I'm constantly posting
- [02:29] different newsletters on a weekly basis.
- [02:32] So, this is where you can easily get
- [02:34] up-to-date knowledge about what is
- [02:36] happening in the AI space. So,
- [02:38] definitely go ahead and subscribe as
- [02:40] this is completely for free. This is the
- [02:42] capability of Avacus AI's deep agent,
- [02:45] the powerful general agent that can do
- [02:47] almost anything. This is something that
- [02:50] not only gets you access of the
- [02:52] capabilities of this unified general
- [02:54] agent, but you also get access to chat
- [02:57] lm. This is a way for you to access
- [02:59] state-of-the-art models like the new GPT
- [03:02] models or the new Sonnet models all
- [03:04] directly in one unified platform. You
- [03:07] also have the ability to access Abacus
- [03:09] AI's desktop app. This is their AI
- [03:12] coding agent that also has a built-in
- [03:15] desktop listener for real-time AI
- [03:17] meeting help. It also is a
- [03:19] state-of-the-art number one ranked
- [03:21] coding agent on Terminal Bench, scoring
- [03:23] a 62.3 percentage, which is one of the
- [03:27] best AI coding agents available that can
- [03:29] help you build almost anything. And with
- [03:32] all of these different tools combined,
- [03:34] you have one of the best workflows for
- [03:36] using AI in your day-to-day tasks. And
- [03:39] the craziest thing is is that all of
- [03:41] this is available for $10 per user build
- [03:44] monthly. With $10, you can access all
- [03:46] the suite of tools that Abacus AI
- [03:48] provides, which is just insane. So to
- [03:51] get started, use the link in the
- [03:52] description below and head over to
- [03:53] Abacus AI's website and you can click on
- [03:56] get started to create an account. After
- [03:58] signing up or logging in, you're going
- [04:00] to be then greeted with the main
- [04:01] dashboard of Deep Agent. This is where
- [04:03] you can interact with this unified AI
- [04:06] agent to accomplish any task based off
- [04:08] the natural language description that
- [04:10] you give it. You can have it build out
- [04:12] apps, powerpoints, use it for browser
- [04:14] automation, create chat bots, AI
- [04:17] workflows, and so much more. The options
- [04:19] are truly endless. And to showcase how
- [04:22] powerful Deep Agent is, I can simply go
- [04:24] ahead and request it to build something
- [04:26] like a stock insights dashboard for Meta
- [04:28] and Nvidia. This is where it is going to
- [04:31] be able to aggregate the latest news,
- [04:33] analyzes and market trends from credible
- [04:36] web sources. This is where I wanted to
- [04:38] include sections for price movement,
- [04:40] analyst recommendations, social
- [04:42] sentiment, and emerging trends affecting
- [04:44] each stock. Now, the reason why I'm
- [04:47] doing this is because I want deep agent
- [04:49] to write the backend, design the
- [04:50] interface, and I also wanted to perform
- [04:53] the research and even generate the daily
- [04:55] recommendations based off of the fresh
- [04:57] indications. You can see right here it
- [05:00] is creating a rough plan as to how it's
- [05:02] going to accomplish this. And if you
- [05:05] validate this, you can tell it to
- [05:06] continue forward or you can tweak
- [05:08] certain components of this. I'm using
- [05:10] the new DP agent feature where it is
- [05:12] going to allow the app that it creates
- [05:14] to refresh itself autonomously every
- [05:17] single day at 9:00 a.m. PTD. The reason
- [05:20] why is because this is a new feature
- [05:23] that deep agent has integrated within
- [05:26] its platform where it can recursively
- [05:29] work on gathering new data, scraping new
- [05:32] contents and it can even update visuals
- [05:34] and push out clean daily summaries for
- [05:36] you. Right now it is thinking to create
- [05:38] a plan and it's going to execute it by
- [05:41] developing the fullon structure for it.
- [05:43] It looks like it has started working on
- [05:46] the research phase where it is working
- [05:48] on using multiple sources with its deep
- [05:51] research capabilities to get the right
- [05:53] contents needed to build out this
- [05:55] dashboard. It is then going to work on
- [05:57] coding out the whole on dashboard and
- [05:59] then deploying AI agents to execute the
- [06:02] task that we had told it to like
- [06:04] performing the research and even
- [06:06] generating the daily recommendations
- [06:08] based off the indicators. Looks like it
- [06:10] is now live streaming the code being
- [06:13] generated for each and every component
- [06:15] of this app to be functional from the
- [06:17] back end all the way to coding out the
- [06:19] front end. And then after it's finished,
- [06:21] you can take a look at the preview of it
- [06:23] once it has finished creating the app.
- [06:25] You can even get a log and then deploy
- [06:27] it directly with a single click. And say
- [06:29] if you're interested in downloading all
- [06:31] the files, this is a way for you to
- [06:33] download a zip archive of this folder.
- [06:35] And then you can start working on
- [06:37] iterating on it locally if needed, maybe
- [06:39] even with the desktop coding editor that
- [06:42] Abacus AI provides. And there we go.
- [06:45] Just take a look at this dashboard which
- [06:47] looks absolutely amazing guys. This is a
- [06:49] productionready dashboard that has live
- [06:52] insights on these different stocks like
- [06:54] Meta as well as Nvidia showcasing the
- [06:56] market cap, volume, PE ratio and the
- [06:59] current price chart. You can also get a
- [07:01] good recursive analysis on the market
- [07:03] news. So every single day it is going to
- [07:06] deploy the AI agents to recursively
- [07:08] extract contents and it will even source
- [07:10] it to the correct source as to where it
- [07:13] found it. and it actually validates the
- [07:15] source as well cuz there's other agents
- [07:17] that run in the background to make sure
- [07:19] that everything is functional in that
- [07:21] case. There's pricing charts that have
- [07:23] been generated market news with the
- [07:25] latest headlines, AI insights, which is
- [07:28] pretty cool because it gives you good
- [07:29] analysis on if the stock is a buy or
- [07:32] not. You can also track performance
- [07:34] metrics as well as trends. And then if
- [07:37] needed, you can refresh the data, which
- [07:38] is where it's going to deploy the agents
- [07:40] to recursively find the new data that is
- [07:44] going to be updated upon this dashboard.
- [07:46] And something cool that you can also do
- [07:48] is have it so that it can actually work
- [07:51] on sending you a condensed report of the
- [07:53] findings every single day. So, if you
- [07:55] want it after 9:00 a.m. PTD, it can send
- [07:58] you a good condensed version by having
- [08:00] it set up through an email account. If
- [08:03] you like this video and would love to

- [08:22] one simple example of what you can do
- [08:24] with deep agent. There's endless
- [08:26] possibilities with this. So, I highly
- [08:28] recommend that you take a look at this
- [08:29] because you have the ability to access
