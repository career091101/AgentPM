- [00:03] AI agents have joined the global
- [00:05] workforce.
- [00:07] NVIDIA IQ and Agentic AI blueprint lets
- [00:11] enterprises connect AI agents to
- [00:13] reasoning models and data systems. Given
- [00:16] a task, agent TJ needs to reason, plan,
- [00:20] iterate, and use tools to generate a
- [00:22] final report.
- [00:24] For example, what if I want to research
- [00:27] information for a board brief?
- [00:31] IQ uses NIM and Nemo to help TJ
- [00:34] synthesize hours worth of research in
- [00:36] minutes. Llama Neotron Super lets TJ
- [00:40] reason and has the capability to switch
- [00:42] its reasoning functionality on or off. A
- [00:45] single multi-purpose model. When on, the
- [00:48] model can find the best answer faster
- [00:50] than other similar reasoning models.
- [00:53] Nemo agent ops tools helps TJ process
- [00:56] information, adapt and learn. It can
- [01:00] ingest pabytes of data faster with
- [01:02] worldclass semantic query accuracy.
- [01:06] Nemo curates user and AI feedback, then
- [01:09] post- train small models to exceed the
- [01:12] accuracy of larger ones for greater
- [01:14] efficiency.
- [01:18] With the IQ blueprint, developers can
- [01:20] unlock the full potential of AI agents.
