- [00:00] In July of 2013, a bizarre video game
- [00:02] appeared online. It was called Kanye
- [00:04] Quest 3030. And on the surface, it
- [00:07] seemed like nothing more than a weird
- [00:09] indie project made by a fan of hiphop.
- [00:11] The premise was absurd. So, if you watch
- [00:13] my videos for a while, you know I have
- [00:16] last few years always trying to make
- [00:18] this AI video production workflow work.
- [00:20] And it's been with some success, but I
- [00:23] think now we are really close to
- [00:26] something perfect. Uh, I've been working
- [00:28] on this over the weekend and it's just
- [00:30] insane to be honest how good it's gotten
- [00:32] since uh the last time I tried. So, I
- [00:35] don't know if I'm going to go through
- [00:36] all the steps here, but basically I can
- [00:38] take this quick. So, this is the pool
- [00:40] workflow. So, we have uh some source
- [00:42] material and we're going to check the
- [00:44] archive if we have done the story before
- [00:46] just to check. Extract extract uh MP3s
- [00:50] files from the MP4 files and transcribe
- [00:52] them into text using whisper. generate
- [00:55] the video script, the voiceover script,
- [00:57] send it to 11 Labs and we're going to
- [01:00] ret transanscribe the voice over to get
- [01:01] timestamps that we can compare with uh
- [01:05] the clips and for that we need to
- [01:07] generate the timeline generate AI images
- [01:10] to fill in gaps in our video that is
- [01:12] missing clips for so that we using nanob
- [01:15] pro for that and we're going to process
- [01:17] the clips we're going to compose the
- [01:19] video again with ffmpeg generate some
- [01:22] thumbnails and some data if we need that
- [01:24] And yeah, we're going to archive the
- [01:26] story so we know that we have already
- [01:28] done this story. That's the final clip.
- [01:30] And then we have the video fully able.
- [01:32] We also have some background music and
- [01:34] stuff. So I just want to show you how
- [01:36] this works. Oops. I just want to show
- [01:38] you how this works now and how good it
- [01:40] has become with the opus cloud code and
- [01:44] all of the other bunch of tools that is
- [01:46] new. So yeah, let me just walk you
- [01:48] through like a full workflow of this and
- [01:49] we're going to see what kind of video we
- [01:51] can generate. So the way I have been
- [01:53] using this is trying to create clips
- [01:55] from my own videos. That has been my
- [01:57] testing. But I wanted to show you a bit
- [01:58] more interesting use case uh for the
- [02:01] video. Yeah, because my videos are a bit
- [02:03] boring for this. Uh I'm a big fan of the
- [02:06] YouTube channel Chilling Scares. And he
- [02:08] often has different stories inside his
- [02:10] videos. So I just got a copy of his
- [02:13] video here, Disturbing Internet
- [02:15] Mysteries that has been solved. I really
- [02:17] recommend checking that out. So, uh, I
- [02:20] put that into my video folder here on
- [02:22] cursor. And that is basically all I want
- [02:24] to do. Usually, I just put my own videos
- [02:26] here, but I just want to show you kind
- [02:28] of how this work with a bit more of
- [02:29] interesting story. Okay. So, what I can
- [02:33] do now is I can go to claude and I can
- [02:36] just do Yeah. Claude code. When I head
- [02:39] into that, I am in my Yeah, cloud code
- [02:42] here. I think you should see this. Maybe
- [02:44] do this. Okay, perfect. So we have
- [02:48] something called custom commands. So I
- [02:51] have created a custom command for my
- [02:54] workflow. So I can quickly show you how
- [02:56] this looks. Now if we go to my custom
- [02:59] command, you can see here we have all
- [03:01] the steps. So your expert script writer
- [03:04] writing exciting stories interesting to
- [03:06] watch. Great hooks and pasting. And we
- [03:09] have the step remember the image we had
- [03:11] step 1 0 to 10. All of this is described
- [03:15] in my slash command here in cloud code.
- [03:19] So basically hopefully I can just press
- [03:22] enter now and the full video workflow
- [03:25] will be done autonomously. That's my
- [03:27] goal. So let's see if we actually can do
- [03:30] this now. So kind of what's going to
- [03:32] happen now is uh this command is just
- [03:35] going to follow everything we put into
- [03:38] our instructions, right? So step zero to
- [03:41] 10. So you can see now it's kind of
- [03:44] looking for what videos do we have. You
- [03:46] can see we found the disturbing
- [03:48] mysteries video that we put in. Okay,
- [03:51] let's do this. So we're going to probe
- [03:52] it to see the length. We're also going
- [03:54] to check out what stories we have done
- [03:57] in our archive. Okay, we probe the
- [04:01] video. We found the length of it and the
- [04:03] source video is about 27 minutes long.
- [04:06] Check the storage. Uh we haven't
- [04:08] archived yet. Okay, that's good. So now
- [04:10] we can just wait for that. So what we
- [04:12] are doing now is we're taking the MP4
- [04:14] file and extracting only the audio
- [04:17] because we only want the MP3 file to run
- [04:21] with Whisper here to get the full
- [04:22] transcription with the timestamps. Uh
- [04:25] I'm going to show you how that looks
- [04:26] when this is complete. Okay. So you can
- [04:28] see that was completed. Now we got 300
- [04:30] segments of transcription and we're
- [04:33] going to check it out. So if we go in
- [04:35] here, you can see the transcription
- [04:37] here. Now this is I can zoom in a bit.
- [04:40] So the first uh from second three till 9
- [04:44] we have this text on January 25th of
- [04:47] January 2010 ready user ready user disco
- [04:50] God godfather 692 made a post. So now we
- [04:53] kind of get uh uh the start, the end and
- [04:57] the text right. So this is important
- [05:00] when we are going to select here what
- [05:02] kind of stories we want to do or when we
- [05:05] can find clips because these clips also
- [05:07] relate to the audio and what kind of
- [05:10] clips are in the video we can do a yeah
- [05:14] a clip from. Okay. So you can see now uh
- [05:17] we are looking at kind of what stories
- [05:18] we're going to pick. This is going to
- [05:20] pick the Kanye West Kanye quest 330
- [05:24] story. Okay, this is what we're going to
- [05:26] do. The source run from uh Okay, so
- [05:29] we're going to look at the original
- [05:31] video. So, we just want to get the one
- [05:34] uh ARG cult mystery story in this video
- [05:36] game. Okay, perfect. So let's see what's
- [05:41] going to do next is actually we're going
- [05:44] to generate a voice over script uh that
- [05:46] we are going to send to 11 labs to
- [05:48] actually get our full story here. So
- [05:51] yeah yes I want to do that. Okay and
- [05:54] here we have the full script. So it's
- [05:55] nine
- [05:57] uh how many seconds? 500 seconds that's
- [06:00] about yeah you can see the full script
- [06:02] here. So this is what we are sending to
- [06:05] 11 labs. Perfect. generate voice over
- [06:09] and we have like a set voice some
- [06:11] generic voice I found and now we are
- [06:14] running this script here Python code to
- [06:16] actually generate the voiceover script
- [06:18] we're going to do now when this script
- [06:19] is over is that we need to retranscribed
- [06:21] it if you remember this step here
- [06:23] retranscribe voice over because we also
- [06:26] need the timestamps
- [06:29] uh for the new story right so it's 7
- [06:32] minutes and 20 seconds and now we're
- [06:34] going to transcribe this again to get
- [06:36] the time stamp amps for our voice over.
- [06:39] Okay, so that was done. So now you can
- [06:41] see the next up uh we're going to
- [06:42] actually create the visual timeline we
- [06:44] talked about. So this is the timeline
- [06:47] where we want to look at um how we
- [06:50] should put the story together based on
- [06:52] the clips and the timestamps. And we
- [06:54] also going to generate some I see we can
- [06:56] do three AI images here to fit in the
- [06:59] gaps we maybe are missing in our story.
- [07:01] Right? So we're going to do three
- [07:03] images. Uh maybe that's at least three
- [07:06] images. Okay. And these are going to be
- [07:08] incorporated into the video. So yeah,
- [07:11] let's just uh do this uh images and then
- [07:14] we can move on. Okay. So our timeline is
- [07:17] done. Uh we can look at how this looks
- [07:19] now. So if we go in here, uh I think
- [07:22] it's actually in uh so if you look at
- [07:25] timeline now, you can see this is how
- [07:27] we're going to do this.
- [07:29] Um okay. So let me just check. Yeah,
- [07:32] timeline. Okay.
- [07:35] So you can see now we have our plan
- [07:36] here. We have a clip and where it
- [07:39] starts, what kind of clip it is and it's
- [07:41] a hook, right? 35 seconds and perfect.
- [07:46] So that is kind of our timeline. 13
- [07:49] clips and four images.
- [07:51] So now we're going to generate those
- [07:52] images. Okay. So I think our images is
- [07:55] done. Now if we go in here and check the
- [07:57] image folder. Yeah, we have four
- [08:00] different images that we are going to
- [08:02] use in our video here. They all kind of
- [08:05] look the same. Perfect. Kanye Quest
- [08:07] 3030. Perfect. So now it's basically
- [08:12] starting to processing the clips. Uh
- [08:14] this is quite boring. So I'm going to
- [08:16] This is just an FFmpeg operation in two
- [08:19] parts. So I'm just going to skip this
- [08:21] for you and take you back when Yeah,
- [08:23] that should be basically our video done
- [08:25] now. So I just wanted to bring you back
- [08:27] uh because we are now uh coming into the
- [08:29] final part. We have actually uh clipped
- [08:32] everything together. Uh the video
- [08:34] editing is done by the AI. So that
- [08:36] should be finished. And you can see we
- [08:38] are at 17 minutes. So fully autonomously
- [08:43] we are at 17 minutes. This took from
- [08:46] start to finish. That is pretty
- [08:49] incredible. And when you see the results
- [08:52] now, you will kind of see what I mean.
- [08:54] And this has completely changed how I do
- [08:57] clips from my videos, right? It just
- [09:00] saves me so much time. It does the video
- [09:02] editing. It does the planning. It comes
- [09:05] up with a story. Uh so I can create
- [09:07] different stories from my videos. Uh I
- [09:10] create images to fill in the gaps we are
- [09:12] missing. I can do background music as
- [09:14] you will hear that I created soon.
- [09:17] Uh I can get title suggestions. The
- [09:20] video game that was actually a cult
- [09:22] recruitment tool. Okay, that's pretty
- [09:24] interesting. We can get thumbnails. What
- [09:26] thumbnails did they come up with for
- [09:28] this uh video type? We get a
- [09:31] description. Uh, of course, this is an
- [09:33] example, but for my video, this could be
- [09:35] something else. So, these are the
- [09:37] thumbnails it came up with. Uh, we have
- [09:40] some Yeah, I don't like that. Do I like
- [09:42] this thumbnail?
- [09:44] I don't think so. What about uh this?
- [09:46] Nah, not the best. Uh, okay, that wasn't
- [09:50] too bad.
- [09:52] Uh, yeah. Okay, so the thumbnails could
- [09:54] have some work here, but basically you
- [09:56] get the idea.
- [09:58] And basically now I think all we have to
- [10:01] do so we archive the story so we don't
- [10:03] repeat this if uh I'm going to do some
- [10:05] future videos uh on Yeah, of course not
- [10:08] on this but on on my channel. So I think
- [10:11] all we have to do now is just watch uh a
- [10:13] minute or something of the completed
- [10:15] video. Uh so you yeah know what Okay,
- [10:19] perfect. So that was done. So, let's
- [10:21] just watch a minute of it. And yeah, I
- [10:24] think you're going to like it. So, if we
- [10:26] go here now, you can find the final
- [10:28] video here. Uh, okay. So, uh, I'm going
- [10:32] to open this in like a separate, uh,
- [10:35] player, and I'm going to play you like 1
- [10:37] minute or something. Uh, I'm going to
- [10:40] turn off my camera here. In July of
- [10:42] 2013, a bizarre video game appeared
- [10:44] online. It was called Kanye Quest 30030.
- [10:47] And on the surface, it seemed like
- [10:49] nothing more than a weird indie project
- [10:51] made by a fan of hip hop. The premise
- [10:53] was absurd. You played as Kanye West,
- [10:55] who falls through a mysterious portal
- [10:57] and wakes up in the year 3030. In this
- [11:00] dystopian future, America is ruled by a
- [11:02] clone of rapper Lil B, who believes
- [11:04] himself to be a god. The world is filled
- [11:06] with clones of other famous rappers.
- [11:08] Tupac, Jay-Z, Eminem. Your mission as
- [11:11] the player is to assemble a team of
- [11:12] these legendary artists, defeat Lil B,
- [11:15] and save the country. It was strange. It
- [11:17] was kind of funny and for a while people
- [11:19] played it, laughed about it and moved
- [11:20] on. The game even caught the attention
- [11:22] of Video Game Dunkey, one of the most
- [11:24] respected reviewers on YouTube. But like
- [11:26] most indie games from that era, it
- [11:28] eventually faded into obscurity. No one
- [11:31] gave it a second thought until January
- [11:33] 2015 when someone discovered what the
- [11:35] game was really hiding. An anonymous
- [11:37] user made a post on 8chan detailing a
- [11:40] shocking discovery. At one point in the
- [11:42] game, an NPC asked the player a simple
- [11:44] question. What do you want to do?
- [11:46] There's a sixletter blank space where
- [11:47] you can type your response. Most players
- [11:50] typed random words and moved on, but
- [11:52] this user decided to type something
- [11:53] different. Ascend. The moment they hit
- [11:55] enter, everything changed. The player
- [11:58] >> Okay, so that was pretty good, right?
- [12:00] Uh, I've been just so impressed over
- [12:02] this weekend trying to figure out this
- [12:04] pipeline. And I haven't really kind of
- [12:08] comp comprehended what this really means
- [12:09] for kind of my workflow yet. Uh, but I'm
- [12:13] definitely going to keep exploring.
- [12:14] Also, I just wanted to mention you can
- [12:16] see uh for the thumbnails uh it we
- [12:19] extracted some frames from the video
- [12:22] that we tried to use in the thumbnails,
- [12:24] right? And with Nano Banana Pro, we can
- [12:26] kind of take this. Yeah, you can see we
- [12:28] could have used this uh to a new level.
- [12:32] But what this means for my workflow and
- [12:34] how I do video automation, I haven't
- [12:36] kind of comprehended yet. But basically
- [12:39] this is going to be a huge change
- [12:41] because Opus 4.5 especially in claw code
- [12:44] is so good at actually creating the
- [12:47] stories, putting everything together,
- [12:48] not making mistakes and the videos I've
- [12:52] been doing has been just so good.
- [12:55] They've been like very good production
- [12:57] and the story and the clipping has been
- [12:59] very interesting because the because
- [13:01] Claude here it doesn't only do the
- [13:04] clipping, it also do the planning. So,
- [13:06] it kind of has the context of what the
- [13:08] video is about and from that it writes a
- [13:11] script based on that and it selects
- [13:14] clips it wants to put into this to
- [13:16] create tell the story. So, what I'm
- [13:19] going to try out the next few days is
- [13:21] bring in like a bunch of different
- [13:22] videos and try to create an interesting
- [13:25] story uh based on a lot of different
- [13:28] sources. That is going to be my next
- [13:30] project. So, if a lot of people like
- [13:32] this video, I'm going to do a follow-up
- [13:34] how that went. So yeah, hopefully this
- [13:36] gave you some inspiration uh what you
- [13:38] can do with the new Opus or with other
- [13:41] tools. Yeah, just go out there and do
- [13:44] crazy stuff because this is really
- [13:46] getting really interesting. And I have a
- [13:48] bunch of other video ideas I want to
- [13:50] share too with things I've been doing
- [13:51] lately. Uh one of them has made me a
- [13:54] good chunk of money actually. I might
- [13:56] share that too. Uh but yeah, thank you
- [13:58] for tuning in. Like I said, hope this
- [14:00] gave you some inspiration and I see you
- [14:02] again uh soon.
