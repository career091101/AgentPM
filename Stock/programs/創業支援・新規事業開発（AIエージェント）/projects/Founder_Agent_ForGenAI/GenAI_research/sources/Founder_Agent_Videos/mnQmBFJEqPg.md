- [00:00] I have built hundreds of AI agents and
- [00:02] in this video I'll show you the six
- [00:04] agents that everyone needs and I'll also
- [00:06] explain how to turn this into a
- [00:08] profitable side hustle and no it's not
- [00:11] by building an automation agency. So to
- [00:13] build AI agents NA10 is the simplest way
- [00:16] by far. It is more powerful than
- [00:18] make.com's API and it is easy to get
- [00:20] started and you can basically build any
- [00:22] AI agent you want inside of NA10. So
- [00:24] let's start with the trigger and again
- [00:26] there are hundreds of different options.
- [00:27] For example, if you select on app event,
- [00:29] you can select from thousands of
- [00:32] different apps that are natively
- [00:33] connected into any. However, for this
- [00:35] build, I'm actually going to go with the
- [00:37] schedule trigger. This is one of the
- [00:38] most useful types of triggers inside of
- [00:40] any, which lets you set an interval.
- [00:42] Could be days, could be hours, even
- [00:44] seconds, right? I'm going to go with
- [00:45] days once a day. So, the first agent I'm
- [00:47] going to be building is an infinite lead
- [00:49] followup. And this is what it's going to
- [00:51] look like when it's finished. But
- [00:52] basically, it will follow up with any
- [00:54] types of leads. could be job candidates,
- [00:56] could be potential clients, and it's
- [00:58] going to keep following up until you get
- [00:59] the sale. So once you decide on the
- [01:01] schedule, next you need the first action
- [01:03] step, right? What is the first thing the
- [01:05] AI agent should do after we call him? In
- [01:08] this case, it needs to be Gmail get many
- [01:10] messages. There it is. So it can analyze
- [01:13] multiple different emails that you
- [01:14] received and decide what actions it
- [01:16] wants to take on those emails. Now, this
- [01:18] is very important. Anytime you make any
- [01:21] change inside of any 10, make sure to
- [01:22] click save. Otherwise, you risk losing
- [01:24] progress. So, inside of the Gmail node,
- [01:27] we need to select which email do we want
- [01:29] our AI agent to look at. Right? So, if
- [01:31] you don't have any emails connected,
- [01:33] simply click on create new credential.
- [01:34] And this is actually probably the
- [01:36] hardest part. So, if you're willing to
- [01:38] sit through the next 3 minutes, you will
- [01:41] already be ahead of 99% of people. And I
- [01:43] can promise you that because most people
- [01:45] cannot even set up a single Google
- [01:47] service into their AI agent and they're
- [01:50] just going to drop off and never
- [01:51] automate anything in their life. So if
- [01:53] you can stick through the next three
- [01:54] minutes, you will begin your automation
- [01:56] journey and you can get rid of all the
- [01:58] boring in your life. So what we
- [02:01] need to do is we need to go to Google
- [02:02] Cloud Console. So let me show you how to
- [02:03] do that. This is going to be the email
- [02:05] inbox I'm going to be automating and
- [02:07] anything I send out, it's going to
- [02:09] automatically get follow-ups. So if you
- [02:11] send out a job application, it's going
- [02:13] to keep following up with that company
- [02:15] until they respond to you. Same with,
- [02:16] you know, getting clients as a business,
- [02:18] whatever you want to do. This agent is
- [02:20] universal. Everyone needs him. So to set
- [02:22] this up, we need to go into Google and
- [02:23] type in Google Cloud Console. Boom. Hit
- [02:27] enter. Click the first link. Now make
- [02:28] sure to switch to the same account you
- [02:30] want to automate. Now at the top, we
- [02:32] need to create a project, right? Create
- [02:33] project. New project. Let's name it NA10
- [02:36] email follow upper. I know very creative
- [02:39] name. For location, just leave it as is.
- [02:41] Click create. And this is how Google
- [02:43] Cloud Console works. Basically, you have
- [02:45] these different projects and in these
- [02:46] you have these off clients. You don't
- [02:48] have to understand all of it. Just
- [02:49] follow what I'm doing. Follow these
- [02:51] steps. I'm going to show you everything
- [02:52] in this video. So, you can see the
- [02:53] project has been created. Click on
- [02:54] select project. And you need to see it
- [02:56] in the top. There we go. NA10 email
- [02:58] follow-uper. Beautiful. Since we're
- [02:59] going to be using Gmail, we need to type
- [03:01] in Gmail API and we need to enable this.
- [03:04] There we go. Enable. Literally just one
- [03:06] click. Takes a few seconds to load and
- [03:08] it's going to enable it for this
- [03:10] project. And boom. Just like that, it's
- [03:11] enabled. So, let's click on OAF consent
- [03:14] screen and then click on clients. We
- [03:16] need to create a new client. Get
- [03:19] started. So app name I'm going to name
- [03:21] David Andre and A10 agent. Support email
- [03:24] just select the email you're automating.
- [03:26] Next audience you can only select
- [03:28] external. If you have a Google Workspace
- [03:30] you can select internal but just click
- [03:31] on external. Next email address just
- [03:34] paste the same one. Next. And then agree
- [03:36] continue. Create. All right. So all of
- [03:38] configuration created. So let's click on
- [03:40] clients on the left again. Create
- [03:41] client. And this is the last step. So
- [03:43] web application. We can rename this as
- [03:45] NA10 followup agent. And here is the
- [03:48] important part, right? So if we go back
- [03:50] into NA10, we can see that this is the
- [03:52] redirect URL. So copy that. Boom.
- [03:54] Authorized redirect URLs. Paste this in.
- [03:57] Create. The next two things is the
- [03:59] client ID and the client secret. So we
- [04:02] get those when you click create. So
- [04:04] client ID, just copy paste those. Boom.
- [04:06] Client secret. Just like that. Copy
- [04:08] paste. And then click on save. And next
- [04:12] we need to click on this button which
- [04:13] appears after you fill this out. Sign
- [04:15] with Google. And this is really the last
- [04:17] stretch. So we need to select the email.
- [04:19] We have a access block. Let's see. App
- [04:22] is being tested. Okay. So we I think I
- [04:25] didn't add myself as a developer. That's
- [04:26] a mistake. Let's go back to our client
- [04:28] audience. Test users. There we go. Need
- [04:30] to add myself as a test user. Save.
- [04:32] Nice. So now we can continue, but it
- [04:35] doesn't seem like it. You might see,
- [04:36] okay, David, this is another error.
- [04:37] Actually, it's not. It's just bad UI. We
- [04:39] need to click on continue. Right. It's
- [04:40] it's kind of tempting to click on back
- [04:42] to safety, but don't worry. We're
- [04:43] absolutely safe here. Just click on
- [04:45] continue and then u it's the permissions
- [04:48] you want the AI agent to have. So I want
- [04:50] my full email management. Continue and
- [04:52] connection successful. Now we did the
- [04:54] hardest part low key. Now just building
- [04:56] the agent is going to be much easier and
- [04:58] this is going to compound to all the
- [04:59] other agents. So keep in mind this is
- [05:01] only the first of six AI agents that I'm
- [05:03] going to show you. And each of them you
- [05:05] can take the lessons from this one and
- [05:07] just build them that much faster. And
- [05:08] honestly if you implement all six of
- [05:10] these agents into your life, you're
- [05:12] going to save multiple hours per week.
- [05:14] Now, before we add the AI agent, there
- [05:15] are actually a few other things we have
- [05:17] to do inside of the Gmail note. First of
- [05:19] all, make sure to enable return all.
- [05:21] Leave simplify turned on. And then
- [05:23] inside of filters, this is super
- [05:24] important. We need to click on search
- [05:26] and do in send. This is the same search
- [05:28] you can do inside of Gmail. Just do in
- [05:31] send. Now, it's funny because I've never
- [05:32] sent an email from this Gmail address,
- [05:35] but for most emails, you probably use
- [05:36] them to send stuff as well. You can also
- [05:38] do something like has attachment,
- [05:40] whatever works inside of Gmail. This is
- [05:42] the same logic that will work in this
- [05:44] NA10 node. So this since it's a
- [05:47] following up agent, we need to check
- [05:49] which emails we send so that it can
- [05:51] follow up on them with that recipient.
- [05:54] So this is it like this note is good. So
- [05:56] we can save that and actually we can run
- [05:58] it so we can test out if it works. So
- [06:00] get many messages. Let's see. And as
- [06:02] expected we have no output data because
- [06:04] we didn't send an emails. But let me
- [06:05] just quickly send an email to myself.
- [06:08] Boom. Hi David, how are you doing?
- [06:11] testing anything at the moment. Let me
- [06:14] know how it goes. All right. So, I'm
- [06:15] just going to send one email so we have
- [06:16] some data to work with. And now we have
- [06:19] actually something in the send. So,
- [06:21] let's go back and let's rerun this so we
- [06:23] can see if our node works. And there we
- [06:26] go. One item. So, just like that, we
- [06:28] have proven that our first two nodes
- [06:29] work. The schedule trigger will be
- [06:31] executed once a day. And then the Gmail
- [06:33] will successfully pull all sent emails
- [06:36] from your inbox that you just connected
- [06:38] and you get all the data whether it's
- [06:40] the history ID, the internal date, the
- [06:43] payload, the subject line or the
- [06:45] recipient. Everything you might need is
- [06:47] in this output data which of course
- [06:49] we're going to use to feed that into an
- [06:50] agent to process it to write a
- [06:52] personalized short follow-up message.
- [06:54] Okay, so let's click on save. Now the
- [06:56] next note I'm actually going to use a
- [06:58] code note. This one is the most
- [07:00] customizable note. You can either use
- [07:02] JavaScript or Python. I'm going to use
- [07:04] JavaScript. So, I'm going to replace
- [07:05] this default. I'm going to delete all of
- [07:06] it with something I prepared ahead of
- [07:09] time just to save you guys time. Now,
- [07:11] you might be thinking, "Okay, David, how
- [07:12] can I create this? This is so complex."
- [07:14] Calm down. I'm going to show you. You
- [07:16] can literally do this with JGBT. So,
- [07:18] inside of JBT, you need to describe what
- [07:20] you want. Here's how that looks like for
- [07:22] this agent. Build a function that
- [07:24] processes Gmail messages data to find
- [07:26] friends where you reached out but never
- [07:27] got a response. So all of this, you
- [07:29] know, you don't have to understand
- [07:30] JavaScript as long as you can describe
- [07:32] what exactly you want. You can build
- [07:34] essentially anything. Just make sure to
- [07:36] use CH GB thinking because it's a lot
- [07:38] more powerful than the default GPD5. So
- [07:41] once CHGBD finishes generating the code,
- [07:43] just click copy code right here at the
- [07:45] top of the code block. Go back into NA10
- [07:47] and paste it inside of your JavaScript
- [07:49] node. So just like with every single new
- [07:52] node we add, we should test it. You
- [07:54] should never build a full automation
- [07:55] without doing any testing because then
- [07:57] you're going to be stuck in many
- [07:58] different errors, right? You want to fix
- [08:00] the errors one by one as you're building
- [08:01] it. So, let's run this node. Boom. Node
- [08:04] executed successfully. And let's look at
- [08:05] the output here. Now, the simplest way
- [08:07] to explain this is that this code, it
- [08:10] basically finds all the emails where you
- [08:12] didn't get a response, right? This is
- [08:13] like all the failed outreaches because
- [08:16] you don't want the agent to be running
- [08:17] on the ones that did get a response. So,
- [08:19] this one finds the ones that failed and
- [08:21] gets their thread IDs. That's just how
- [08:23] Gmail notifies them. Basically, those
- [08:25] are the people who completely ignored
- [08:27] you because those are the ones we need
- [08:28] to follow up with. Okay, so the next
- [08:30] note after this one is going to be a
- [08:32] loop loop over items. Boom. There we go.
- [08:34] And here we don't have to literally do
- [08:35] any setup. It's as simple as possible
- [08:37] because it's going to run on our AI
- [08:38] agent. So, we need to replace this node.
- [08:40] We need to delete it and replace it with
- [08:42] something else. So, let's click on plus.
- [08:44] And inside is going to be our AI agent.
- [08:46] This is going to be the decision maker
- [08:47] of how do we follow up, right? What the
- [08:50] message looks like, how does the email
- [08:51] look like. So let's click on save and
- [08:53] let's configure the AI agent. Now to do
- [08:55] that let's quickly run the loop node.
- [08:57] Super simple and then we have some input
- [08:59] data in the AI agent to work with.
- [09:00] Right? So let's customize the pro
- [09:02] message. We need to click on define
- [09:03] below and then click on expression. Now
- [09:06] if you just look at the left side of the
- [09:07] data which is always the input, right? A
- [09:09] lot of people are confused by NA10
- [09:11] because if you're using for the first
- [09:12] time, it might seem intimidating. But
- [09:14] when you realize that the left side,
- [09:16] this side is just the input data. The
- [09:18] middle is the current node, aka what we
- [09:21] do with that data. And the right side is
- [09:23] the output. So what the data looks like
- [09:25] after this node is executed. Once you
- [09:27] understand this, the UI doesn't look so
- [09:29] intimidating. So if you look on the
- [09:31] left, what do we need, right? Well, we
- [09:33] need the subject and we probably need
- [09:35] the snippet. So we just need to define
- [09:38] something like this where we say subject
- [09:40] and then JSON.ubject which by the way
- [09:43] let me show you a pro trick. You can
- [09:45] just drag it over. This is the beauty of
- [09:47] NA10. So when you identify the data you
- [09:49] want just literally drag it over and
- [09:51] just like that boom it's there. So
- [09:53] whether you're like oh David you
- [09:54] pre-prepared this. I don't know how to
- [09:55] do it. All you need to do is really drag
- [09:57] stuff from the left into the middle to
- [09:59] kind of build your prompt. That's the
- [10:01] essential skill when using the AI agent
- [10:03] inside of NA10. Now the snippet again,
- [10:06] same thing, right? This text is just so
- [10:09] we tell the agent this is the snippet.
- [10:11] Boom. You can literally rename this like
- [10:13] here's the email body, whatever you want
- [10:16] it to be, you know, just type it in
- [10:18] there. This is the user prompt. This is
- [10:19] telling the agent what the email is
- [10:22] about. However, the user prompt is not
- [10:23] enough. We also need a system prompt.
- [10:25] So, let's click on add options system
- [10:27] message. And this is where we're going
- [10:28] to tell the AI agent how to behave. So
- [10:30] once again, let's switch to expression
- [10:32] because you can click this button to
- [10:34] make it full screen, which is much
- [10:35] easier to edit. And again, I prepared
- [10:37] this ahead of time, but feel free to
- [10:39] pause and copy it. By the way, all of
- [10:41] the AI agents, all of the prompts,
- [10:42] everything from this video is inside of
- [10:44] the classroom of the new society. So
- [10:46] when you go to templates and presets
- [10:47] right here, you can literally get all
- [10:49] the AI agents from my past videos as
- [10:51] well as from this video and just copy
- [10:53] paste them into your life and business.
- [10:54] So actually inside of any 10 what you
- [10:56] can do is click on these three dots in
- [10:57] the top and click on import from file
- [10:59] and then you can select a JSON file
- [11:01] which is a pre-built agent and boom just
- [11:03] like that I imported the full AI agent
- [11:05] already configured into my NA10. So if
- [11:08] you want to just skip through a lot of
- [11:09] steps maybe you're a busy business owner
- [11:11] you don't have time join the new society
- [11:13] go into the classroom click on templates
- [11:15] and presets and here you can access all
- [11:16] of my agents all my pre-built
- [11:18] automations all of my prompts and
- [11:20] instructions everything you need to
- [11:21] start automating your life and business.
- [11:23] The link to new society is going to be
- [11:25] below the video. Now, back to NA10. So,
- [11:27] I'm going to delete this because I'm
- [11:28] showing you how to build it from
- [11:30] scratch, but that was just for you that
- [11:32] want to skip through some steps. Let's
- [11:33] define the AI agent. So, we have the
- [11:35] system prompt again. Uh it just defines
- [11:37] the behavior of it, right? So, what the
- [11:39] task is, input explanation, how the
- [11:41] output should look like, the tone and
- [11:43] style, basic pro engineering. You can
- [11:45] customize this for how you want your
- [11:47] emails to look. Obviously, we still get
- [11:48] an error inside of the AI agent. And the
- [11:50] reason is we're lacking the chat model.
- [11:53] Without the LLM, without the large
- [11:55] language model, the AI agent is just a
- [11:58] body without a brain. The LLM is the
- [12:00] brain. It's what gives it the
- [12:01] intelligence. Now, you can either use
- [12:02] OpenAI for models like GPT. You can use
- [12:06] Enthropic for the cloud models, Google
- [12:09] for Gemini models, or you can use Open
- [12:11] Router to access all of the models. Now,
- [12:13] most of you are probably familiar with
- [12:14] CHI GBD. So, we're going to stick to
- [12:15] OpenAI. and it's also one of the
- [12:17] simplest to set up. For the model, I
- [12:20] would like to use GPD 4.1. This is one
- [12:23] of the most reliable models in the world
- [12:25] right now. It's much more reliable than
- [12:27] GPD5, and sometimes it's even better to
- [12:29] be honest, especially in agentic
- [12:31] workflows. So, let's select that. Now,
- [12:33] our automation is a bit messy. I don't
- [12:35] like when it looks ugly, but we're going
- [12:37] to fix that in a bit. The main part is
- [12:39] we need to define the credential, right?
- [12:41] So, this is basically the OpenAI API
- [12:44] key. As you can see, I already have a
- [12:46] few, but if you don't have any, just go
- [12:48] to Google again and type in platform
- [12:50] OpenAI.
- [12:52] Boom. And click on the first link,
- [12:53] platform.openai.com.
- [12:55] In here, you need to log in with the
- [12:56] same account as using CHBD. So,
- [12:59] hopefully if you're watching this, you
- [13:00] have a CHGBD account. If not, you're
- [13:03] kind of falling behind. So, in top left,
- [13:05] click on login. Once you log in, click
- [13:07] on dashboard. On the left, click on API
- [13:09] keys. Create new secret key. I'm going
- [13:11] to name it NA10 follow upper. Boom.
- [13:14] Create secret key. Once again, do not
- [13:17] share these with anybody. Treat them as
- [13:19] passwords. I'm going to delete this key
- [13:21] before uploading this video. Go back to
- [13:23] NA10. Credentials. Create new
- [13:25] credential. Just paste your API key.
- [13:28] Save. It's testing it. Boom. Just like
- [13:30] that. Tested successfully. Which means
- [13:32] we can now use any of the OpenAI models.
- [13:34] And there is really like all of them.
- [13:36] You can use even GBD5. If you want to
- [13:38] use GPD5, you know, why not? Boom. There
- [13:41] we go. GPD5
- [13:42] select. So now we have the AI agent with
- [13:45] the chat model. The next thing is the
- [13:48] output, right? What does the agent do?
- [13:50] It needs to reply to the message aka
- [13:52] send an email. So let's click plus right
- [13:54] here after the agent output. We need to
- [13:55] find the line. Click plus. Do Gmail.
- [13:58] Select Gmail. And then reply. Reply to a
- [14:02] message. Okay. Select the first one. Let
- [14:04] me reorganize it a bit so it looks
- [14:05] nicer. Very important. Double click on
- [14:07] this once again. Select the same
- [14:09] account. resource message operation
- [14:11] reply message ID let's switch to
- [14:14] expression the email type switch that to
- [14:16] text there we go text and the message is
- [14:19] just going to be JSON output switch to
- [14:21] expression JSON output and that should
- [14:24] be it to be honest let's save that and
- [14:26] let's run this again so execute workflow
- [14:30] it's finding a message there was instant
- [14:32] now it's the AI agent is running with
- [14:34] open AI API okay GPD5 will take like a
- [14:38] few seconds to respond
- [14:40] So, this one is writing the email
- [14:41] obviously and then it's going to send
- [14:42] the email and the loop over again if we
- [14:45] have more items obviously because this
- [14:47] one can work um even if you have 20
- [14:49] emails right that you send out. Oh,
- [14:51] there we go. So, workflow has finished.
- [14:53] Let's check our email. Did this get a
- [14:55] follow-up. Okay. And I can already see
- [14:58] that it did which is beautiful. So, look
- [15:01] at this. Hey there, following up on my
- [15:02] note from the other day in case it
- [15:04] through. I'm happy to reset context.
- [15:06] Isn't this beautiful? We just got an AI
- [15:08] agent automatically follow up on an
- [15:10] email that I sent out. Now, obviously in
- [15:11] this case it was 38 minutes ago, but
- [15:13] imagine this was sent like a few days
- [15:15] ago, right? And it didn't get a
- [15:16] response. AI agent runs, follows up.
- [15:19] Amazing. Like this is going to save so
- [15:20] many hours in so many businesses and so
- [15:23] many jobs. It's crazy. This is not going
- [15:25] to replace jobs. A lot of people listen
- [15:27] to, you know, Sam Alman, Dario, these
- [15:29] people who hype up You have to
- [15:32] realize the CEOs of the companies, they
- [15:33] have the most incentive to hype
- [15:35] everything up. However, AI agents are
- [15:37] going to replace the most repetitive,
- [15:39] boring parts of your job. So, you can
- [15:41] focus on the creative stuff because
- [15:42] LLMs, news flash, are not creative and
- [15:46] it will not be solved just by scaling.
- [15:48] It will needs an entirely different
- [15:50] architecture. Why? Because large
- [15:52] language models are sequence models. All
- [15:54] they do is predict the next word aka the
- [15:57] next token. So, they cannot have a
- [15:59] inventive original thought like humans
- [16:01] can. So, what I'm trying to say is that
- [16:03] you don't have to worry for your job.
- [16:04] Instead, you should be excited that
- [16:06] agents like this can replace all the
- [16:08] boring in your job and you'll do
- [16:10] the creative high leverage stuff. And
- [16:11] again, this is just the first of the six
- [16:13] AI agents I'm going to show you. Plus,
- [16:15] later in the video, I'll show you how
- [16:16] you can actually make real money by
- [16:18] selling NAT agents like this one to
- [16:21] businesses for thousands of dollars.
- [16:23] However, in order to start building AI
- [16:24] agents, either for yourself or for other
- [16:26] businesses, you need to know how to host
- [16:28] them, which is one of the biggest
- [16:30] problems beginners face. Luckily, the
- [16:32] solution is quite simple and that is
- [16:33] Hostinger. This is what I use for all of
- [16:35] my AI agents, for all of the AI agents
- [16:37] we use in our team because it's the
- [16:39] simplest way you can start building AI
- [16:41] agents, plus one of the most affordable
- [16:43] ways as well. So, let me show you how to
- [16:44] set it up. If you get the KVM2 plan,
- [16:47] which I would recommend you to get, you
- [16:48] can literally run hundreds of AI agents
- [16:50] on this plan, and it will cost you way
- [16:52] less than if you used the NA10 Cloud,
- [16:54] especially if you go with the 24 month
- [16:56] option, which I definitely recommend you
- [16:58] do because you want your AI agents
- [16:59] running forever. You build them once and
- [17:01] they save you time in perpetuity. And
- [17:03] since Hostinger was kind enough to
- [17:04] sponsor this video, if you use the
- [17:06] coupon code David, you will save
- [17:08] additional 10% off on your annual or
- [17:11] 2-year plan. Then what remains is
- [17:13] selecting the server location. So just
- [17:14] select whatever is closest to you. I'm
- [17:16] in Czech Republic, so Germany is super
- [17:17] close. And then for the operating
- [17:19] system, click on NA10. They literally
- [17:21] have a one-click install template for
- [17:23] NA10. It couldn't be any easier. So
- [17:25] click on confirm and then click on
- [17:26] continue and log in with your hosting
- [17:28] account or just create one. And the last
- [17:30] thing that remains is filling out your
- [17:31] billing details and your credit card.
- [17:33] I've been using Hostinger for months to
- [17:35] host my enter agents. And it really is
- [17:37] the simplest and most affordable way to
- [17:39] do so. So again, make sure to check out
- [17:40] the link description and remember to use
- [17:42] code David to get 10% off. All right. So
- [17:45] once you have your Hostinger VPS, go to
- [17:47] the panel, click on home, and select
- [17:49] manage. Here we can see how our virtual
- [17:51] private server is running and all the
- [17:53] usage you see about it. So this is
- [17:55] another advantage over the N10 cloud.
- [17:57] You can actually see this data that NA10
- [18:00] otherwise wouldn't give you. So all we
- [18:02] need to click is manage app and this
- [18:03] will launch the NA10 server where we can
- [18:05] see all of our AI agents. All right,
- [18:06] let's look at the second AI agent which
- [18:08] is realistic AI videos. And there is
- [18:11] hundreds of ways you can do this. You
- [18:13] can use it for marketing, for B-roll in
- [18:15] videos, for you know promotions like um
- [18:19] for uh interviews, for upskilling your
- [18:23] employees. I mean get creative. You know
- [18:25] realistic videos are changing the world.
- [18:26] There's like the startup Synasia I'm
- [18:29] going to pop up on screen that is
- [18:31] scaling like crazy. I think they're like
- [18:32] 200 million ARR and all they do is like
- [18:35] create realistic video avatars, right?
- [18:37] So this automation is going to teach you
- [18:39] how to do that. It's actually pretty
- [18:41] simple. So trigger the trigger doesn't
- [18:43] really matter to be honest. Here I have
- [18:44] a schedule trigger. You can do WhatsApp,
- [18:47] Telegram, up to you. Trigger isn't the
- [18:49] main thing here. The main thing is
- [18:50] honestly the V3, but we're going to get
- [18:52] to that. Be patient. Second note is
- [18:55] Google Sheets, right? So, so this is
- [18:56] simple get rows in a sheet. You connect
- [18:58] Google Sheets API just like we did with
- [19:00] Gmail API earlier. Then resource click
- [19:03] on sheet within document operation get
- [19:05] rows and then document by URL. So here
- [19:08] is the doc for this and for this example
- [19:11] I'm going to keep it super simple and
- [19:13] I'm following a trend. It's actually
- [19:15] much bigger than I thought which is ASMR
- [19:18] videos. Right? So let me show you
- [19:19] example. So here's an example of a video
- [19:21] completely generated with AI including
- [19:23] the sound. So take a listen.
- [19:30] So yeah, this is ASMR. Uh to be honest,
- [19:31] I don't really watch or listen to ASMR,
- [19:34] but you'll be surprised how big the
- [19:35] market is. I mean, some of these videos
- [19:36] are getting hundreds of millions of
- [19:38] views, but again, you can use this
- [19:39] anyway. I'll show you how to customize
- [19:40] the prompt. So yeah, you attach the
- [19:43] Google sheet, then you select which
- [19:44] sheet because, you know, sheets have
- [19:46] different pages. So just select the
- [19:47] correct page. Then underneath filters
- [19:50] column, click on status and then value
- [19:52] start. So when this goes to start this
- [19:55] is when the automation will be triggered
- [19:58] right. So we can do like a marketing
- [20:00] video for a real estate company blah
- [20:02] blah blah whatever you want this is the
- [20:04] video ID release this is the prompt and
- [20:05] then you switch it to start and the
- [20:07] trigger will pick it up and under
- [20:08] combine filters select and and that's it
- [20:11] as you can see the Google sheets note is
- [20:12] pretty simple then we have a AI agent
- [20:14] and this guy is responsible for writing
- [20:17] the prompt. So whatever you write here,
- [20:19] you just put the video idea. This AI
- [20:22] agent has a prompt that is optimized for
- [20:25] creating. Well, this one again is for
- [20:27] ASMR, but you can style this for like
- [20:29] marketing videos, right? So you can say
- [20:31] marketing
- [20:33] marketing video copywriter, right?
- [20:37] Whatever you need for your own use case.
- [20:41] Feel free to update this prompt. But
- [20:42] basically, this turns the vague video
- [20:45] idea into an optimized prompt for V3,
- [20:48] which is the video model we're using.
- [20:51] Uh, in this case, we're using OpenAI
- [20:53] GBD4 mini. Again, whatever model you
- [20:56] prefer. My favorite is GBD4.1. It's more
- [20:59] powerful than the mini, and it's very
- [21:01] cheap as well. Let me save that
- [21:03] actually. And then this is the main
- [21:05] part, the HTTP request, right? So, what
- [21:08] does this do? Again, you might be
- [21:09] thinking, okay, David, I don't know what
- [21:10] HTTP is. Honestly, you don't even need
- [21:12] to understand what HTTP stands for. For
- [21:14] those who are curious, it's hypertext
- [21:16] transfer protocol. But the main thing is
- [21:18] is that we do a request to this URL.
- [21:21] Okay, so this is the URL where V3 is
- [21:23] hosted. We're using replicate for this.
- [21:25] Honestly, you can think of replicate as
- [21:27] kind of an open router but for videos
- [21:29] and AI images, right? But it's more than
- [21:31] that because you can actually host the
- [21:34] models here as well. Open router is just
- [21:36] the router. But as you can see here, we
- [21:38] already have V3 fast. We have some other
- [21:41] AI video models. Uh but for this we're
- [21:44] using Google V3. This is the most
- [21:47] powerful version of Google's video
- [21:49] model. And look at this realism, right?
- [21:51] You upload an image and then it gives
- [21:53] you a realistic video which you could
- [21:56] easily fool a lot of people with this.
- [21:58] So in here, if you click on HTTP, you
- [22:01] get instructions on how to do the
- [22:03] request, right? You see the
- [22:04] authorization be better token. You see
- [22:06] the headers. You see the prompt right
- [22:09] here. Resolution aspect ratio. So
- [22:11] replicate gives you everything you need.
- [22:13] And all you can also use it in Python,
- [22:15] NodeJS, whatever you want. So this is
- [22:17] the power of replicate and it makes it
- [22:19] very easy where you don't have to host
- [22:20] these models yourself. Right? So we're
- [22:23] using a basic HTTP request to the
- [22:26] replicate URL. And then just like I
- [22:28] said, we send the headers specify them
- [22:30] exactly as they are specified right
- [22:32] here. So, authorization and we put the
- [22:34] bearer token and this is actually your
- [22:37] replicate API key. So, do not share this
- [22:40] with anybody. I'm going to have to
- [22:41] delete mine after upload or before
- [22:44] uploading this video. Hopefully, I don't
- [22:46] forget. But yeah, this is your API key.
- [22:47] So, it looks like this or whatever
- [22:50] whatever whatever. And just if you're
- [22:52] curious, you can create this in your
- [22:53] account. So, click on your account,
- [22:55] click on API tokens here. Put your uh
- [22:58] API name. So, I can put like VO free
- [23:00] agent and just create token. Now, I
- [23:03] think you get a few dollars for free,
- [23:05] but if it doesn't work, just charge up
- [23:07] like $3 and you'll be fine. Just keep in
- [23:09] mind if you want to create hundreds of
- [23:10] videos with V3, it is more expensive
- [23:12] than languages, right? Generating videos
- [23:14] is more expensive than generating text.
- [23:18] So, you know, keep that in mind. The
- [23:19] costs are $320 per 8second video. So, if
- [23:23] you are completely broke, this agent is
- [23:25] not for you. But if you have that
- [23:27] hustle, if you have that entrepreneurial
- [23:29] resourcefulness, you can flip these
- [23:31] videos for hundreds of dollars. Like you
- [23:33] can sell video creatives for companies.
- [23:35] You can sell mockups like interior
- [23:37] design, walkthroughs, digital. Like
- [23:39] there's infinite opportunity, guys.
- [23:41] Literally infinite. All you need to have
- [23:43] is a bit of initiative and the slightest
- [23:46] bit of work ethic and you can make it.
- [23:47] You can make so much money with AI. It's
- [23:49] kind of disgusting. So this is the setup
- [23:52] for the headers. again authorization
- [23:53] better API key name prefer value weight
- [23:56] send body and then body content type
- [23:59] JSON specify body using JSON and by the
- [24:01] way if you pay attention this JSON is
- [24:03] literally this part of the HTTP request
- [24:07] right so N10 just makes it a bit simpler
- [24:09] by splitting it into multiple fields but
- [24:12] you get the point right so here we need
- [24:13] this is important we actually cannot
- [24:15] send the new lines so by doing u this a
- [24:18] little bit of reg x you know that
- [24:20] replace we replace these new line
- [24:22] characters because that's one thing that
- [24:24] replicate doesn't really like. So yeah,
- [24:26] just make sure there's new line no new
- [24:28] line characters when you're sending
- [24:29] this. And that's pretty much it for the
- [24:30] HTTP request. It's not that difficult.
- [24:33] And actually, I can put something here.
- [24:36] Let me flip this to start. We can flip
- [24:37] this to finish. I can say um strawberry
- [24:40] in the spirit of, you know, strawberry
- [24:42] for OpenAI. Let's create a video about a
- [24:45] strawberry. Let's go step by step.
- [24:47] Schedule trigger. Let's run this.
- [24:49] Successful. Get rows in sheet. Boom. So,
- [24:52] this got Yeah, correct. Nice. We're
- [24:54] going to send this to the AI agent. The
- [24:56] agent is going to write the prompt for
- [24:57] this. Next up, HTTP request. This one is
- [24:59] going to create a video. Then, it's
- [25:02] going to be sent to this one, which is
- [25:03] another HTTP request. And this basically
- [25:05] streams the the output. That's it. This
- [25:08] doesn't really do anything else. Method
- [25:10] get URL JSON URL stream. Maybe there's a
- [25:13] simpler way to do it, but hey, this
- [25:15] works, you know. If you know of a better
- [25:16] way, feel free to comment below. And by
- [25:18] the way, if you want to see more NA10
- [25:20] videos, make sure to subscribe. You
- [25:22] would be surprised how strong of a
- [25:24] signal that is. It takes like two
- [25:25] seconds to subscribe. It's completely
- [25:26] free and it tells me you like this type
- [25:29] of content. So if you want to see more
- [25:31] NA10 videos on your YouTube recommended
- [25:33] page, go below the video and subscribe
- [25:34] right now. So again, this one we
- [25:37] covered. This one I showed you just now.
- [25:39] It streams the output and then it
- [25:40] uploads it to Google Drive. Resource
- [25:42] file operation upload input data field
- [25:44] name data file name. This honestly
- [25:47] doesn't matter much, but here we just
- [25:48] have it for the video idea. So, it
- [25:51] matches the video idea. That's the file
- [25:53] name. And then you put my drive and the
- [25:55] URL folder. Pretty simple. Just like
- [25:58] other Google notes. If you learn a few
- [26:00] of these um Google services, Gmail,
- [26:02] sheets, you'll be able to do all of
- [26:04] them. Whether it's calendar, whether
- [26:06] it's u Google Drive, whether it's I
- [26:08] don't know what else. What else is in
- [26:09] the guitue? They have so many services.
- [26:11] It's crazy. If you learn a few of them,
- [26:13] you can do all of them. Basically NA10
- [26:15] is really compounding like that and then
- [26:18] Google sheets up update row and sheet.
- [26:20] So overall this agent again is simple.
- [26:23] This is six simple agents all people
- [26:25] should have. So you know it's nothing
- [26:27] crazy but you can see this is very
- [26:28] powerful because you could have your
- [26:30] client post stuff here and you could
- [26:32] maybe charge them you know $50 per video
- [26:34] where it's costing you $320 per video.
- [26:37] Very nice arbitrage and a lot of people
- [26:39] in the new society are actually doing
- [26:41] business models like this. You know,
- [26:43] everybody wants to make like 10k a month
- [26:45] with AI, but a lot of people just want
- [26:47] to make $2,000 as a multiple sources of
- [26:50] income. You know, like a lot of people
- [26:51] have a job and they don't want to quit
- [26:52] it. They just want to have a second
- [26:54] source of income with AI. It's totally
- [26:56] possible and I've seen it dozens of
- [26:59] times. So, let's run it. We have the We
- [27:01] have the prompt. Let's look at a wrote a
- [27:04] detailed prompt for how it should sound,
- [27:06] how it should look like. Then, we're
- [27:08] running replicate. This one is the
- [27:10] longest one because it's generating the
- [27:11] video. usually takes between 30 and 60
- [27:14] seconds from my testing. Okay, there we
- [27:16] go. Video has been generated. If we look
- [27:19] at this, we have this output.
- [27:22] So this node kind of simplifies that
- [27:24] just rereams it into a file name. So we
- [27:27] actually have the file with 2.4
- [27:29] megabytes which we can then upload into
- [27:31] Google Drive. So that's why this node is
- [27:33] necessary. It's kind of just formatting
- [27:35] for Google Drive. Let's run it.
- [27:38] Uploading the file also takes a few
- [27:40] seconds. since it's on a server and then
- [27:41] it just updates the row in a sheet
- [27:43] because right now we have um the start
- [27:45] and we don't have the link. So this
- [27:47] should update the sheet so that this is
- [27:50] flipped to finished and we have the
- [27:51] link. Beautiful. Let's look at the
- [27:53] video.
- [27:56] Man, the sounds are so realistic. That's
- [27:58] crazy. And yeah, this is um
- [28:00] hyperrealistic
- [28:01] AI video using the best AI model in the
- [28:03] world. And again, feel free to customize
- [28:05] this prompt. All you need to do is
- [28:07] change the prompt of this AI agent to be
- [28:09] optimized for marketing, recruiting, uh
- [28:12] video creatives, whatever types of
- [28:14] videos you want to make. B-roll for
- [28:16] YouTube videos, faceless YouTube
- [28:17] channels, you can start with this. I
- [28:19] mean, the opportunities are endless,
- [28:20] right? Just customize this prompt so
- [28:21] that it generates videos that you want
- [28:24] and that's pretty much it. You can get
- [28:25] started with it using the best video
- [28:27] model in the world. Now, if you think
- [28:29] generating hyperrealistic videos with
- [28:31] matching sound is impressive, just wait
- [28:33] until you see what's coming. So here is
- [28:35] the first simple AI agent everybody
- [28:36] needs and this one has a bit more nodes
- [28:39] but it's actually pretty simple. So let
- [28:40] me walk through. So here we actually
- [28:41] have two schedule triggers. This one is
- [28:43] running every 11 hours. And basically
- [28:47] what this agent does is tracking a
- [28:49] YouTube channel's performance very very
- [28:52] accurately. So maybe you have some
- [28:54] competitors or maybe you want to track
- [28:55] your own channel. Doesn't matter. Or
- [28:57] maybe you want to sell this to a client.
- [28:59] You know there's plenty of YouTubers who
- [29:01] would buy something like this. I mean,
- [29:03] if you showed me this like a few months
- [29:05] back before I really locked in on any
- [29:07] 10, I would definitely pay $500,000
- [29:10] minimum because you'll see these reports
- [29:12] that this agent generates are very, very
- [29:14] detailed with graphs and stuff. So,
- [29:16] basically, this trigger runs every 11
- [29:18] hours. It checks the RSS feed. So, this
- [29:20] is my channel as an example, but u yeah,
- [29:23] it just checks my videos. Then, we have
- [29:25] a code block which filters out all the
- [29:27] items to only the ones published in the
- [29:30] last 12 hours. So we don't want to be
- [29:32] retracting the same videos over and
- [29:34] over. So that's what this code block
- [29:36] does. To be honest, if you are scared of
- [29:38] code blocks, you can probably like use
- [29:40] some of these um default ones, data
- [29:42] transformation like edit fields, filter,
- [29:45] stuff like that. But a lot of the times
- [29:46] it's just simpler to go to JBD, ask it
- [29:49] to write the code and use a single
- [29:51] JavaScript code block than, you know,
- [29:54] five different manual NAN logics and
- [29:58] loops and conditionals. It's up to you.
- [30:00] whatever you want. Next, we have a
- [30:02] Google Sheets append row in sheet. So,
- [30:04] this actually sets the status to start.
- [30:07] So, here you know, boom, start. And this
- [30:08] is how it looks like, by the way. So,
- [30:10] you can see this is measuring like which
- [30:12] videos are performing on day one, day
- [30:14] three, day um yeah, 1 2 3 7 14 30 which
- [30:20] shows you outliers, which is very very
- [30:22] important to know like maybe your own
- [30:24] channel or your competitors which videos
- [30:27] are outliers. You can study those. You
- [30:29] can think of similar ideas, stuff like
- [30:30] that, right? So, this this agent is very
- [30:34] powerful and again lots of YouTubers
- [30:36] would pay some serious money to have it
- [30:39] and it's building is much simpler than
- [30:41] it might seem. So, again, this uh append
- [30:44] wrote in sheets sets the status to start
- [30:46] sets the video title sets the video
- [30:48] link. So, boom title link. Then we have
- [30:52] another Google Sheets note and this one
- [30:54] gets rows. So same document but the
- [30:57] filter is that it gets all the rows
- [30:59] where the status is at start. So it
- [31:01] ignores the finished ones and it ignores
- [31:04] the empty ones only when there's start
- [31:06] it runs on those basically. Then we have
- [31:08] edit fields and these are the fields to
- [31:10] set. So row number we do JSON row number
- [31:12] and link JSON video link which is
- [31:15] matching from the sheet. So then we have
- [31:17] a few familiar fields again we've
- [31:19] covered these AI agent into update rows
- [31:22] in Google Sheets. But this is where it
- [31:23] gets interesting. Day zero. So here we
- [31:26] have a YouTube node that gets the video
- [31:28] and its views based on the video ID. So
- [31:31] on YouTube every video has ID. Pull up
- [31:33] my latest uh so this is the correct
- [31:35] video, right? You can see this. This is
- [31:36] the video ID in the URL. And this note
- [31:40] gets the views. Then we have a update
- [31:42] row in sheets. So classic Google sheets
- [31:44] row number and then it sets the views on
- [31:46] day one. So in this sheet I'm using fake
- [31:48] data because I didn't want to run this
- [31:50] for 30 days um for obvious reasons. But
- [31:53] yeah, you can see this updates the views
- [31:55] day zero which updates our chart over
- [31:58] here. So for each video this runs and
- [32:01] then something interesting happens. Wait
- [32:04] one day. So this is very interesting
- [32:05] note. Um it literally just waits, you
- [32:08] know. So it's kind of like the schedule
- [32:10] but for a pause. So it pauses the
- [32:12] automation for one and then the unit is
- [32:14] days and then that's day zero and then
- [32:17] on day one it runs again gets the video
- [32:20] updates the rows on how many views it
- [32:22] has in day one and pauses for one day.
- [32:25] So then we have day two which is
- [32:26] basically the same. We track the views
- [32:28] we update the row for day two aka the
- [32:31] column and then we wait one day for day
- [32:33] three. On day three we do a longer pause
- [32:35] until day seven. Again you can configure
- [32:36] this however you want. If you want to
- [32:37] track every single day for 30 days it's
- [32:40] up to you. But I think uh 0 1 2 3 4 7
- [32:43] 1430. That's really good. So basically
- [32:46] this is it. This is um this is the whole
- [32:49] thing. And as you can see even though
- [32:51] there's a lot of nodes it's quite
- [32:53] simple. I mean most of it is kind of
- [32:55] duplicated here with just a delay. And
- [32:57] this automation runs for 30 days until
- [33:00] it's completed. So it's literally inside
- [33:02] of NA10 sitting this execution is going
- [33:05] to be active for 30 days until it's
- [33:08] fully fully done. and it's going to be
- [33:10] tracking all of the views on this
- [33:13] channel. So again, for experimentations
- [33:15] using my own channel. So it's going to
- [33:17] be spotting which are outliers like this
- [33:19] NA10 video for example and which videos
- [33:22] are lacking. And then you can go back
- [33:23] and analyze why did the video flop, why
- [33:26] did this video do well and to any
- [33:28] content creator, this is beyond
- [33:30] valuable. Honestly, like I was being
- [33:32] very conservative when I say $500. to
- [33:34] bigger creators, something like this
- [33:36] could be worth thousands of dollars
- [33:38] because each successful video is going
- [33:40] to make them thousands of dollars. So,
- [33:42] if you can, you know, deliver them one
- [33:43] successful video every 3 months, right?
- [33:45] Every three months is like the ROI on AI
- [33:48] agent like this is kind of crazy. And
- [33:50] again, this is just number three of the
- [33:52] six that I'm going to show you in this
- [33:53] video. So, let's go on onto the next
- [33:55] one. Now, this one has a lot fewer
- [33:57] nodes, but that doesn't mean it's not
- [33:59] useful. It's actually just as useful.
- [34:01] And when I say everyone should have
- [34:03] this, I mean it. Everyone should have
- [34:05] this expense tracker agent. So you can
- [34:08] pretty much understand how it works just
- [34:10] by looking at it. But basically the
- [34:11] trigger is a Gmail note. So you select
- [34:13] which email you want to check. You do
- [34:14] pull times every minute or whatever you
- [34:16] want. And then event is message
- [34:19] received. So when a message comes in
- [34:21] into your email inbox, it will trigger
- [34:23] and it will run an AI agent which will
- [34:25] determine, hey, is this an expense or is
- [34:28] this just spam or some friend emailing
- [34:31] you or whatever, right? So the prompt I
- [34:33] again just like last time identical and
- [34:36] the prompt is this analyze email
- [34:40] personality silent dismiss honestly it's
- [34:42] pretty overkill. Uh the prompts you just
- [34:44] say like if this is an expense do that
- [34:46] if it's not an expense do nothing. This
- [34:48] prompt could be much shorter, but feel
- [34:50] free to take it, copy it. Again, all of
- [34:51] the resources are in the new society
- [34:53] templates and presets. So, if you want
- [34:55] any of these agents, like maybe this one
- [34:57] you could build very relatively fast.
- [34:59] The previous one took some time, but uh
- [35:02] if you want them and just literally just
- [35:03] one click import from file, all of that
- [35:06] is in the new society templates and
- [35:07] presets right here. AI agents by David.
- [35:10] You can download any of these and start
- [35:11] having that agent save you time right
- [35:14] away. literally with a few clicks, no
- [35:16] matter what your business or your life
- [35:17] is. Some of these agents every single
- [35:19] person needs expense tracker is one of
- [35:22] them. So again, this AI agents
- [35:23] determines is this an email with an
- [35:25] invoice, is this a receipt or is this
- [35:27] just some random ass email? For the
- [35:29] model, GPD 4.1 Minute is sufficient. If
- [35:32] you are finding issues that the model is
- [35:33] underperforming, just select 4.1 and
- [35:36] you're going to be chilling. And the
- [35:39] only tool it has is append row in
- [35:41] sheets. So all it does is just append a
- [35:44] single row in Google Sheets. Let me show
- [35:45] you. Could not be simpler.
- [35:48] Boom. There it is. So you have the date,
- [35:50] self-explanatory, date of the
- [35:51] transaction, the category. Honestly, the
- [35:54] category should probably be here. So the
- [35:56] transaction name, then the cost
- [35:58] category, and then how relevant it is.
- [35:59] This is like AI each ranks this 1
- [36:01] through 10. So if it's like a completely
- [36:03] waste um you know like Netflix
- [36:05] subscription might be two. If it's like
- [36:07] groceries might be nine, right? So you
- [36:09] understand this and yeah that's the AI
- [36:12] agent literally could not be simpler and
- [36:16] it automates most of your accounting
- [36:18] needs. Like obviously if you're like a
- [36:20] financial company, you probably need
- [36:22] in-house accountants. But if you're just
- [36:24] a single solarreneur, if you're a small
- [36:28] business owner, if you're a individual
- [36:31] and you just want to have a spreadsheet
- [36:34] with all your transactions categorized
- [36:36] into different categories and with the
- [36:37] relevance that the AI agent decides,
- [36:40] it could not be any simpler. It takes 5
- [36:43] to 10 minutes to build this and it's
- [36:44] going to save you time forever in
- [36:46] perpetuity. Now, let's be honest. The
- [36:47] reason you're watching this is because
- [36:49] you understand the power of automation
- [36:51] and AI agents. But one thing that nobody
- [36:53] is automating is the actions in their
- [36:56] productivity app, which is exactly what
- [36:58] we just released inside of vectal by
- [37:00] adding workflows. There's a lot of
- [37:02] manual that happens in your task
- [37:04] management, in your productivity. Now
- [37:06] you're able to automate it. So inside of
- [37:08] Veectal on the right there is this new
- [37:10] button workflows. In here you can either
- [37:12] use one of the pre-built workflows we
- [37:14] have or create a new one. Daily creative
- [37:17] idea. The trigger, let's go with
- [37:20] schedule. Daily at 8 a.m. And action
- [37:23] create idea. And you can set the prompt
- [37:25] to whatever you want. Maybe you run a
- [37:27] marketing agency. Maybe you do sales.
- [37:30] Maybe you have a fashion design
- [37:32] business, whatever you want. This
- [37:34] workflow will run every single day at 8
- [37:36] a.m. and create an actionable idea that
- [37:39] would get you closer to your goals. And
- [37:40] since Vectal has your user context such
- [37:42] as your word description, short-term
- [37:44] goals, long-term goals, this idea will
- [37:46] be hyper relevant to you. Now, this is
- [37:48] just one of many workflows you're able
- [37:50] to build inside of Veectal. For example,
- [37:52] this one is super useful and it's one of
- [37:54] the pre-built workflows that we built
- [37:56] for you. So, you don't even have to
- [37:57] build it when you use Vectal. So, what
- [37:58] it does, it runs every time an email is
- [38:00] received that fits this criteria, spam,
- [38:03] promotional email, stuff like that. And
- [38:04] then what to do? It marks the email as
- [38:06] red. This single workflow will reduce
- [38:08] the time you spend on your email by 80
- [38:11] to 90%. I have this running on all of my
- [38:13] main inboxes and it's something that
- [38:16] everyone should activate. So if you love
- [38:17] NA10, you're going to absolutely love
- [38:19] Vectal Workflows which allows you to
- [38:21] automate all the boring inside of
- [38:23] your task manure app. So go to vectal.ai
- [38:25] and give it a shot. You can use
- [38:27] workflows even on the free account. So
- [38:29] there is no excuse. Now let's go back to
- [38:31] any. The fifth agent all of you should
- [38:33] have is a personalized outreach email
- [38:35] agent. So all of us at a certain point
- [38:38] in our life need to send an email right
- [38:40] to somebody whether it's a company we're
- [38:41] applying to work at or you know someone
- [38:43] we want to have on a podcast but that
- [38:45] email cannot be basic it cannot be spam
- [38:48] it needs to be personalized and this is
- [38:49] exactly what this agent does. So we have
- [38:52] a schedule trigger right here which
- [38:53] checks again rows inside of a sheet. So
- [38:56] here is what the sheet looks like. We
- [38:58] have the research status. We have the
- [39:00] email. So this is my email for testing.
- [39:02] uh contact company could be vectal
- [39:05] doesn't matter contact name and then the
- [39:07] research. So this is what this agent
- [39:09] does. It does deep research on that
- [39:12] person before sending the email. So if
- [39:14] you're doing cold emails, this will
- [39:16] change the game completely for you. And
- [39:18] um yeah, I'm going to show you how to
- [39:20] build this. So you have the full
- [39:22] personalized email body just by this
- [39:25] little bit of information. All you need
- [39:26] is the contact email and the name of the
- [39:28] person really. So again, this trigger
- [39:32] runs I think it's one once a day. Yeah,
- [39:34] it doesn't really matter. And it checks
- [39:36] all the new leads here. You can set it
- [39:38] to one once an hour. It's up to you.
- [39:40] Schedule trigger is very easy to
- [39:41] configure, you know. Boom. Runs once an
- [39:44] hour just like that. Next gets rows in
- [39:46] sheets. So it gets all the rows with the
- [39:49] start status just like the previous
- [39:52] agents. And then this is interesting. So
- [39:55] you can use either perplexity owner or
- [39:57] there's an alternative way SER API. It's
- [39:59] up to you whichever you prefer. Um some
- [40:02] people are familiar with SER some people
- [40:04] prefer perplexity. So whatever you
- [40:07] whichever you want to use you can use it
- [40:10] just you know detach the other one and
- [40:12] attach this as the chart model entirely
- [40:14] up to you. Then this agent performs web
- [40:16] research. So again either it uses
- [40:17] proplexity or SER but it researches on
- [40:20] this person and the prompt is the main
- [40:22] thing right?
- [40:23] You are a research assistant. Your task
- [40:24] is to perform photo web research on a
- [40:26] specified person and or company. So
- [40:28] there's some more info but that's
- [40:29] basically it. It does deep research on
- [40:33] this person and the company to
- [40:35] understand who it does what it's about
- [40:38] enough info to personalize the email and
- [40:40] then it goes into second AI agent. So
- [40:43] this one writes the email, right? So it
- [40:45] it gets all the info from the previous
- [40:48] agent and the research results. So
- [40:51] actually this is from the sheet and this
- [40:52] is the research results for the previous
- [40:54] agent and it's instructed to write a
- [40:56] personalized collab email as me you know
- [40:59] David you can obviously customize this
- [41:01] prompt however you want again all of the
- [41:03] AI agents from this video are available
- [41:05] in the new society inside of the
- [41:07] templates and preset section. So if you
- [41:09] want to just take the prompts or if you
- [41:10] want to import the whole agent you you
- [41:12] know where to find them. So yeah first
- [41:15] agent does the web search agent writes
- [41:17] the email and then we update the rows in
- [41:19] a sheet. So actually this is the
- [41:21] practical way of doing it. A lot of
- [41:22] people would have it send the email
- [41:24] right away. But this AI agents are not
- [41:27] there yet. Maybe in a year, maybe in two
- [41:28] years where they're like super reliable,
- [41:31] but LLMs hallucinate. LLMs make up
- [41:34] So the way to do it is to have one step
- [41:39] human approval, right? So if you add
- [41:41] like let's say again you can have a
- [41:43] separate agent that does the lead
- [41:44] generation that scrapes the web for
- [41:45] emails and adds the contact names and
- [41:48] then you you launch it once a day you
- [41:50] know the next 10 people are researched
- [41:54] and then the email is written for them
- [41:55] and then you go as a human or you hire a
- [41:58] VA or whatever just double checking that
- [42:00] the email is looking good right maybe if
- [42:02] if it's like if you're doing crazy
- [42:04] volume and you you don't care you can
- [42:06] remove this step but I think for most
- [42:09] most production and most real businesses
- [42:12] you will need to confirm the email that
- [42:15] the AI wrote and maybe instead of doing
- [42:17] that you can actually have a you can
- [42:19] actually have a separate step Gmail and
- [42:22] it can be a draft right create a draft
- [42:25] so that's another way to do it it's just
- [42:27] probably easier to see many of them in a
- [42:28] sheet so if you're doing lots of volumes
- [42:30] saving that in a sheet is easier if
- [42:32] you're doing less volume writing a draft
- [42:35] and then just sending it through an
- [42:36] email you know going to your drafts and
- [42:38] you'll see the pre-written drafts here
- [42:40] and just clicking send probably is
- [42:41] easier. Then the send out of the email
- [42:44] is once you approve it, right? So once
- [42:46] you confirm the status to confirmed, the
- [42:48] second part of the automation runs again
- [42:50] I think once a day or once five minutes
- [42:52] doesn't matter and uh sends out all the
- [42:55] emails that you confirmed. So it gets
- [42:57] the rows by confirmed and it sends the
- [42:58] message and it up updates it to send.
- [43:00] So, this agent, it has a few more nodes
- [43:03] than the previous one, but it's also
- [43:06] very simple and it's beyond useful,
- [43:08] especially for businesses that are doing
- [43:09] cold outreach and that are sending out
- [43:12] lots of emails. This makes sure that the
- [43:14] email is personalized and that it
- [43:16] doesn't get you get higher delivery
- [43:18] rates, higher open rates, and ultimately
- [43:21] more business. That's the goal of this.
- [43:22] And you save yourself time and your
- [43:23] team's time. This agent can be obviously
- [43:26] used in hundreds of different ways, but
- [43:28] if you're doing anything with cold email
- [43:30] outreach, you need an AI agent like this
- [43:33] one. Now, as I promised, I'm going to
- [43:34] also talk about how to turn this into a
- [43:36] side hustle because you can make a lot
- [43:38] of money relatively fast with AI agents.
- [43:41] I mean, these are some offers that
- [43:43] people are offering and I would say
- [43:45] these are not even experts. These are
- [43:47] like medium level AI agent builders,
- [43:49] right? And you can see the start package
- [43:51] 750 and advanced package is 5K and
- [43:53] businesses are paying way more than that
- [43:56] for good AI agents and automations. But
- [43:58] the mistake a lot of people make is that
- [43:59] they don't stand out. You know they like
- [44:02] AI automation agency. No no no business
- [44:04] wants to hear that. If someone reaches
- [44:06] out to me and say like I run an AI
- [44:07] automation agency they instantly get
- [44:10] flagged by my vectoral workflow as spam,
- [44:14] right? Because this is a this is not an
- [44:16] original offer. Nobody wants to work
- [44:19] with an AI automation agency. People
- [44:21] want to be solving, they want you to
- [44:23] solve a specific problem for them. You
- [44:26] need to be specialized. A good way to
- [44:28] stand out is to have an irresistible
- [44:30] offer. And the example like how you can
- [44:32] do that is add a free AI consultation
- [44:34] for an expert. You need to position
- [44:36] yourself as expert, right? So this is
- [44:39] much harder to say no to than oh I'm AI
- [44:44] agency. You know this is I charge this
- [44:46] much. If you just offer a free
- [44:48] consultation with no expectations and
- [44:49] you actually do a lot of preparation
- [44:51] beforehand, maybe you use one of your
- [44:54] agents to help you with the preparation
- [44:55] and the deep research, the company will
- [44:57] be way more impressed. If you put 5
- [44:59] hours of effort into a free
- [45:01] consultation, be like, "Oh, wow. This
- [45:03] guy, this guy did a lot for this, you
- [45:05] know, free call. Like, imagine if I hire
- [45:07] him, he'll probably overd deliver."
- [45:08] That's the type of feeling you need to
- [45:10] leave in your clients. Then to profit
- [45:12] maximize, you want to add some expensive
- [45:15] but great add-ons, right? And this is
- [45:17] where the real money is because business
- [45:19] owners value time. They value speed.
- [45:21] They value efficiency, personalization.
- [45:24] So this is example of someone on Upwork
- [45:26] to doing this today and there's no
- [45:29] reason it could be you. These people are
- [45:30] not experts in machine learning or
- [45:32] experts in math or programming. You
- [45:35] literally have to click and drag in a
- [45:37] tool like NA10 to do this. So this
- [45:39] person which we found is doing the fast
- [45:44] delivery for another 5 to 500 to 100k.
- [45:46] So if you have a bit of work ethic and
- [45:48] you can deliver fast, you can charge
- [45:50] another 1k done for you code. You know
- [45:53] if people want any u automation but in
- [45:56] code boom another 1500 and how can you
- [46:00] do that? Tools like cloth code tools
- [46:02] like codex tools like cursor I've made
- [46:04] countless videos on these. So if you're
- [46:05] subscribed to this channel you will
- [46:07] know. Code guidance is literally could
- [46:09] just be a call explaining the code to
- [46:11] them and how to integrate it. Another
- [46:12] 500. Do you see the upsells are crazy?
- [46:15] That's because this guy knows that a
- [46:17] businessman will happily spend money to
- [46:18] save time for the fast delivery or
- [46:20] happily spend time to, you know, get his
- [46:22] business up to speed with the code
- [46:24] guidance. So really being creative with
- [46:26] the bonuses, with the guarantees, with
- [46:28] the conditions this is where you can
- [46:31] make your offer stand out from everybody
- [46:33] else. I mean this is what Hermosi talks
- [46:35] about. So if you follow, if you follow
- [46:37] Alexi, if you read the book 100 million
- [46:39] offers, you will know all of this. But
- [46:41] applying this for AI agents is where the
- [46:44] untapped opportunity is because this
- [46:45] field is very new and most people have
- [46:47] such a boring commoditized offer. It's
- [46:49] crazy. So what do you need to take away?
- [46:51] It's not about creating the most
- [46:53] complicated agent. Far from it, guys.
- [46:55] All you need is a reliable agent that
- [46:57] specifically targets the business and
- [46:59] helps to solve a specific problem for
- [47:00] that business. Like you don't even need
- [47:03] to show them the notes. It could
- [47:04] literally be four nodes, five nodes. It
- [47:07] could take you an hour to build. Doesn't
- [47:09] matter. It's more about creating a great
- [47:11] offer specific to your target avatar. So
- [47:14] if you're targeting dentists, if you're
- [47:15] targeting real estate agents, whoever it
- [47:17] is you're specializing on, it is all
- [47:19] about the offer. The offer needs to be
- [47:21] compelling. It needs to reverse risk. It
- [47:23] needs to deliver the promise fast. You
- [47:26] need to understand Zatar, what problems
- [47:28] they're facing, what is their dream
- [47:29] outcome. If you don't, you will always
- [47:30] struggle. If you don't, if you do
- [47:33] understand it, you will have more
- [47:34] clients than you can handle. So this is
- [47:36] how you can turn any on missions into
- [47:37] business. Now let me show you the sixth
- [47:39] agent that everyone needs and this one I
- [47:42] really believe everyone needs. So this
- [47:44] agent unlike the other ones which are
- [47:46] more business targeted is for your
- [47:48] personal life to never ever miss a
- [47:50] person's birthday. Right? So you have a
- [47:53] Google sheet once again. Let me show
- [47:55] you. Boom. Where you write down the
- [47:58] birthdays of your friends. Right? So
- [48:00] birthday name interest and actually you
- [48:03] only need to add the let me make it
- [48:05] clear. You only need to add these three
- [48:08] fields, birthday, name, and interest.
- [48:10] The agent takes care of the rest of the
- [48:12] gift ideas and of reminding you. So, if
- [48:15] you have a calendar or some place where
- [48:17] you store all your closest friends
- [48:19] birthdays, you just once add them here
- [48:21] and then we have a schedule trigger.
- [48:24] Honestly, we could probably have it run
- [48:27] uh less frequently
- [48:29] because uh maybe like once a week.
- [48:32] You'll see the way this AI agent works.
- [48:33] Basically what this agent does is that
- [48:35] not only does it remind you of the
- [48:37] birthday when it's coming like up to
- [48:39] seven days before so you have enough
- [48:40] time to buy the gift but also
- [48:42] brainstorms some gift ideas right so it
- [48:44] reads get rows in sheet classic Google
- [48:46] sheet where you have the status as
- [48:50] nothing so this is important you have to
- [48:52] actually set it like so status value
- [48:55] empty otherwise it it doesn't work then
- [48:58] you have the AI agent which brainstorms
- [49:00] the based on the interest It brainstorms
- [49:04] ideas right based on the name. If it's a
- [49:06] man or a woman, maybe the gift ideas are
- [49:08] different. And if the birthday is within
- [49:10] 7 days, it will generate the idea using
- [49:12] a model. So you can use a reasoning
- [49:13] model. If you prefer cloth as ideas, you
- [49:16] know, disconnect openai and connect
- [49:19] anthropic pretty simple change. You just
- [49:22] need to add your uh enthropic API key.
- [49:24] That's the only change. And then we have
- [49:26] a tool structured output parser to
- [49:30] format the output of the agent. Then we
- [49:32] have if else note. So you know a lot of
- [49:35] people use AI agents for simple
- [49:37] conditional logic which is very bad. You
- [49:40] should absolutely use code where
- [49:42] possible. And if else statement is a
- [49:44] beautiful example of that. So don't be
- [49:46] one of these people who spend $1,200 a
- [49:49] month on LLM doing simple Right?
- [49:51] So this was a Reddit post like wow we've
- [49:53] been burning money for 6 months. We're
- [49:55] spending $1,200 a month. And what was
- [49:58] what was they doing? You think, okay,
- [50:00] some crazy AI agent like writing
- [50:02] personalized emails, like really doing
- [50:03] lots of reasoning. No, this person was
- [50:06] extracting phone numbers from text,
- [50:08] which you can do with regular
- [50:09] expression. He was checking profanity,
- [50:12] which you can do matching words against
- [50:14] the blacklist. He was reformatting JSON.
- [50:16] There is countless of JSON parsers that
- [50:19] exist. And he was, this one is the
- [50:21] funniest. He was using the LLM to
- [50:24] uppercase words which literally you can
- [50:27] do with that upper a single method. So
- [50:30] there's a lot of people who are quite
- [50:31] stupid who are using LLMs for things
- [50:34] that you should be using code for. And
- [50:37] this person was spending 1,200 a month
- [50:40] and and he was posting this like wow
- [50:42] look at this optimization after
- [50:44] switching to GPD photo mini we the bills
- [50:46] dropped to $200 a month. No, you're
- [50:48] still a dumbass. You're spending $200 a
- [50:51] month on something that should be a
- [50:53] simple code that costs nearly zero to
- [50:56] run. You can do this all with Python or
- [50:58] JavaScript for nearly zero. It can run
- [51:00] super fast, more reliable, by the way,
- [51:03] than LLM because LM hallucinate and
- [51:04] infinitely faster because a response
- [51:06] from LM can take 1, two, 3 seconds.
- [51:09] Python can run in a few milliseconds.
- [51:11] Same with JavaScript. So don't be one of
- [51:13] these people who avoid code at all cost
- [51:16] and then look like absolute retards when
- [51:18] they use LLMs for this. and spend
- [51:20] hundreds of dollars a month on stuff
- [51:22] that has been solved for decades with a
- [51:25] few lines of code. So this is what I
- [51:28] mean. We can use an if statement here. A
- [51:30] lot of people would use a AI
- [51:31] agent here. It's like, okay, if it's
- [51:33] true, redirect to Telegram. If it's
- [51:35] false, like guys, come on. No matter if
- [51:38] you're not a beginner programmer, it's
- [51:39] all about constructing logic. It's not
- [51:41] about being a senior developer. An AI
- [51:43] agent is really good at like recognizing
- [51:46] if email is spam or not, right? based on
- [51:48] the context of the email, who sent it,
- [51:50] how it was phrased. There's a lot of
- [51:52] different like variables and nuances
- [51:53] that goes into that. You cannot just use
- [51:55] a black list of words, right? Because
- [51:57] that would be unreliable and it would do
- [51:59] false flags. So, use AI where it makes
- [52:01] sense. But if you can solve something
- [52:03] with a few lines of code, use code for
- [52:06] that, right? And the beauty of NA10 is
- [52:08] that a lot of the code is actually a
- [52:10] place replaced with these nodes. So, you
- [52:12] have these like data transformation
- [52:14] nodes where a lot of them like edit
- [52:16] fields, right? set modify, add or remove
- [52:18] fields, filter, remove fields, matching
- [52:21] conditions, limit the these are all like
- [52:25] logic that otherwise you would have to
- [52:27] write code. But thanks to NA10, you
- [52:29] don't have to do that. You have these
- [52:31] pre-built, pre-created nodes that you
- [52:34] can just click and drag and drop. And
- [52:36] again, all you need to do is kind of
- [52:38] think through the logic in your brain.
- [52:40] And once you know how your AI agent or
- [52:42] AI automation should work, you can build
- [52:44] it just with these notes. Instead of
- [52:46] putting AI agent everywhere where it
- [52:48] doesn't make sense. So again, if it's
- [52:50] true that the birthday is coming up, we
- [52:51] send a text message on Telegram
- [52:53] reminding you that, hey, your friend's
- [52:55] birthday is coming up. I mean, look, to
- [52:57] be honest, this is mostly for men,
- [52:58] right? Let's be honest. Women, they all
- [53:00] always somehow remember their friend's
- [53:01] birthday up to like two months before
- [53:03] they're preparing for it. It's crazy how
- [53:05] much effort they put into this So,
- [53:07] this is mostly for us guys. um so that
- [53:10] we don't forget about one of our best
- [53:12] friends birthdays and the AI agent also
- [53:13] brainstorms the gift idea. If you want
- [53:15] more ideas, just change the prompt to
- [53:17] brainstorm five different ideas. One of
- [53:19] them is most likely going to be
- [53:20] relevant. And yeah, this AI agent,
- [53:23] unlike the other ones, is for your
- [53:24] personal life, but it will allow you to
- [53:26] be one of the favorite guys in the group
- [53:29] because you never miss a birthday and
- [53:31] you always have a per ready when one of
- [53:34] your boys birthday comes. So yeah, this
- [53:36] AI agent is also something that everyone
- [53:38] should have just in case. Even if you're
- [53:39] great with birthdays, it never hurts to
- [53:42] be reminded. So yeah, these were six AI
- [53:44] agents that everyone should have. And
- [53:48] again, the beauty of NA10 is that once
- [53:50] you build your first agent, you you
- [53:52] defeat most of the friction. It's it can
- [53:54] be intimidating at the start, but if you
- [53:56] really get started, if you really push
- [53:57] through to the first one or two agents,
- [54:00] the rest is really easy because you you
- [54:03] do the same right? Schedule
- [54:04] trigger. We've learned that Google
- [54:06] Sheet, we've learned that AI agent, we
- [54:08] know that. So like most of the notes
- [54:10] you're already familiar with. So really,
- [54:12] I would encourage you to sit down, block
- [54:14] out 60 to 90 minutes in your calendar
- [54:16] and build your first NAT agent. This is
- [54:19] a beyond valuable skill to have in the
- [54:21] next few years. It will future proof
- [54:23] yourself against being replaced because
- [54:26] if you can in your company be the guy
- [54:28] who finds a way to automate the process,
- [54:31] trust me, no boss is going to ever fire
- [54:33] you. So yeah, this has been six AI
- [54:35] agents that everybody needs. And again,
- [54:37] once you build agents, you need to host
- [54:39] them somewhere. And the best option is
- [54:41] by far Hostinger is the simplest way.
- [54:43] It's like literally one click. You don't
- [54:46] have to know anything about VPS
- [54:47] management. None of that. They make it
- [54:48] so easy to run self-hosted NA10 on a
- [54:52] VPS. And it's also one of the most
- [54:54] affordable options out there. So once
- [54:56] again, thank you Hostinger for
- [54:57] sponsoring the video. Make sure to use
- [54:58] code David for another 10% off when
- [55:01] going with the annual or Twitter plan.
- [55:03] And with that being said, thank you guys
- [55:05] for watching and have a wonderful,
- [55:06] productive week.
