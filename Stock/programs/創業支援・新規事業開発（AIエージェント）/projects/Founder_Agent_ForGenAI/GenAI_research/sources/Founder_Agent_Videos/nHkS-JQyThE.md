- [00:00] Yesterday, Google had launched Gemini
- [00:02] 3.0, the most advanced AI model ever. It
- [00:05] delivers state-of-the-art reasoning,
- [00:07] multimodal intelligence, and aentic
- [00:09] abilities that can turn any sort of idea
- [00:12] into a working solution instantly. For
- [00:14] example, just take a look at the quality
- [00:16] of apps it can create. In seconds, it
- [00:19] was able to produce a stunning front-end
- [00:21] UI of a web page. Fullon complex
- [00:24] animations and components that would
- [00:26] normally take developers days to build.
- [00:28] Designing has never been this fast and
- [00:30] easy. And with the launch of the Gemini
- [00:33] 3.0 Pro model, you can now easily access
- [00:36] it completely for free because Google
- [00:38] has made it super accessible. You can
- [00:40] use many of their suit of tools like
- [00:42] anti-gravity, their IDE to access it for
- [00:45] free or Google AI Studio. And a way to
- [00:48] basically harness its capabilities is
- [00:50] with the build mode. This is where you
- [00:53] can supercharge any idea with this
- [00:55] Gemini 3.0 0 Pro model completely for
- [00:58] free. This is where people have been
- [01:00] creating incredible apps. Here is an
- [01:03] example app that was built with the
- [01:05] build mode and this is where it
- [01:07] generates SVG based off the textual
- [01:09] prompt you give it. This is where it
- [01:11] created a space rocket SVG where you can
- [01:14] download the code and you can see that
- [01:16] it has downloaded the SVG code for this
- [01:18] space rocket ship. This is another app
- [01:20] where you can bring any idea to life,
- [01:23] where you can attach wireframes,
- [01:25] doodles, or napkin sketches. In this
- [01:27] case, I'm uploading a napkin sketch of a
- [01:30] blog article page, and we're going to be
- [01:32] handing it over to this app that was
- [01:34] built with the build mode. And by
- [01:35] providing the napkin sketch diagram or
- [01:38] wireframe, this app is going to make it
- [01:40] more interactive and visually appealing
- [01:43] so that we can interact with these
- [01:44] sketches a lot better. Just like that,
- [01:47] it was able to take our napkin sketch
- [01:49] and make a dashboard that helps us
- [01:52] interact with the components that we had
- [01:54] drew out. This is a great way for you to
- [01:56] get interactive lessons from diagrams as
- [02:00] well as have it generate various sorts
- [02:02] of components directly into a visualized
- [02:06] dashboard. With this canvas, you can see
- [02:07] that it was able to depict every
- [02:09] component that we had drew out and it
- [02:12] was able to thoroughly output it with
- [02:14] the code. And you can even play a
- [02:16] prototype that visualizes how this
- [02:18] actually works that mimics all of the
- [02:20] components that we had drew out. This is
- [02:22] the capability of the build mode and
- [02:25] this is the type of quality of apps that
- [02:27] you can create with it. And the best
- [02:29] part is is that you can interact with
- [02:31] the code where you can easily download
- [02:33] it locally so that you can have it so
- [02:35] that you can iterate further on this app
- [02:37] that the Gemini model developed
- [02:39] completely for free. You can even save
- [02:41] it to GitHub and you can even copy this
- [02:43] app and share it around with others.
- [02:45] Before we get started, I just want to
- [02:47] mention that you should definitely go
- [02:48] ahead and subscribe to the World of AI
- [02:50] newsletter. I'm constantly posting
- [02:52] different newsletters on a weekly basis.
- [02:55] So, this is where you can easily get
- [02:57] up-to-date knowledge about what is
- [02:59] happening in the AI space. So,
- [03:01] definitely go ahead and subscribe as
- [03:02] this is completely for free. But what I
- [03:05] really love about the new build mode
- [03:07] inside Google AI Studio is that it can
- [03:10] basically supercharge your apps with
- [03:12] Google's AI integrations, which you see
- [03:14] over here. Gemini 3.0 doesn't just
- [03:16] generate a beautiful UI, it is also
- [03:19] going to be able to create a functional
- [03:22] app, it powers it. And with the build
- [03:24] mode, it can instantly plug in these
- [03:26] preset AI features that makes your app
- [03:28] practical, useful, and production ready.
- [03:31] You can add an AI powered chatbot. You
- [03:34] can add the use of Google Maps data
- [03:37] directly within your app. Ability to
- [03:39] generate images with Google models.
- [03:41] There's so much you can do to integrate
- [03:43] with your app. And you can simply just
- [03:45] select how many presets you want within
- [03:48] your app and it will be integrated
- [03:50] directly with it. So, let's get started.
- [03:52] We're going to select the Gemini 3 Pro
- [03:54] preview model and we're going to
- [03:55] describe whatever we want to build. And
- [03:58] what we're going to do is have an AI
- [04:00] powered chatbot built inside our app as
- [04:02] well as have Gemini intelligence
- [04:04] integrated within it. The reason why is
- [04:06] because we're building a content fixer
- [04:09] and connoisseur app that is a small
- [04:11] editor powered by Gemini. It can
- [04:13] analyze, rewrite, and improve any text.
- [04:16] It is a context aware of our chatbot
- [04:18] that's also integrated. It can improve
- [04:19] text users paste in and it's going to be
- [04:22] able to make multi-step edits for you.
- [04:24] And you can see that once you send in
- [04:26] the prompt, the thinking mode will be
- [04:28] integrated within this build mode where
- [04:30] it's going to reason and work on how
- [04:33] it's going to accomplish this task. And
- [04:34] you can get a good detailed
- [04:36] understanding of the steps it's going to
- [04:38] take to accomplish this. And now it is
- [04:40] working on building out the code. And
- [04:43] you'll get a live preview of what it's
- [04:45] actually generating live in action.
- [04:50] And there we go. It ran for only 95
- [04:53] seconds and it was able to build out our
- [04:55] app. All the components have been fully
- [04:57] developed and you can actually visualize
- [04:59] the code that it generated for all of
- [05:01] the components. Now, if we go over to
- [05:03] preview, we can try this out. We can
- [05:05] paste in any type of text here. This is
- [05:08] a short story that I had provided within
- [05:10] the draft editor. And we can use all of
- [05:12] these features that we wanted it to
- [05:13] integrate like proofread. You can also
- [05:16] shorten it. You can even summarize it.
- [05:18] and directly. If you click on these
- [05:19] buttons, it'll work on providing the
- [05:21] brief summary. You can see that it is a
- [05:24] story that talks about someone is in a
- [05:26] quiet city library, an old AI named
- [05:29] Lumen residing in a forgotten computer
- [05:32] uh is finding its purpose when a young
- [05:35] girl mirror blah blah blah blah blah.
- [05:36] But you can see that it was able to
- [05:38] actually work on uh creating the summary
- [05:41] for this. You can also add in a
- [05:43] professional tone to this. In essence,
- [05:45] this is an ideal text editor app that it
- [05:47] built in less than 90 seconds. And it
- [05:50] was able to do a great job in
- [05:52] implementing all the features that we
- [05:53] had requested. It was able to have it so
- [05:56] that whenever you paste in any text, you
- [05:58] can use the AI Gemini features built
- [06:00] within this app to get you the
- [06:02] enhancements you're looking for. Whether
- [06:04] that's summarizing it, adding a new
- [06:06] tone, or proofreading it. This is
- [06:08] something that you can easily work with
- [06:10] to develop anything. And you can even
- [06:12] add other features to it like improve
- [06:14] prompt suggestion could be another
- [06:16] feature you can add and it will fully
- [06:18] work on coding that new feature out
- [06:20] built within this app. Now in my
- [06:22] yesterday video with the studio I was
- [06:24] actually able to create a fullon
- [06:26] Minecraft clone. Guys, this is where I'm
- [06:28] currently building my house. Uh
- [06:31] obviously certain components are still a
- [06:33] little wonky but overall it did a great
- [06:35] job in building out the terrain. And you
- [06:37] can see this with the trees. you have
- [06:39] the ability to move around actually as
- [06:41] most Minecraft clones don't even let you
- [06:43] do that. But in this case, I can place
- [06:45] down different blocks and it was able to
- [06:47] depict how a terrain actually looks like
- [06:50] how you would typically see something
- [06:52] within the sandbox game itself. You're
- [06:54] going to be able to also break different
- [06:56] blocks. And you can see that it also
- [06:59] adds the bottom layer, which is the
- [07:01] cobblestone. This is something that I
- [07:03] developed in a single shot, and it's
- [07:05] just incredible to see. In short, you
- [07:08] want to be using these tools that are
- [07:10] free right now. And it's something that
- [07:12] you can make the most out of by simply
- [07:14] just creating a Google account. All you
- [07:16] got to do is just simply create a Google
- [07:18] account and you can access these
- [07:19] capabilities, state-of-the-art models
- [07:21] that can help you design, build, and
- [07:24] turn any idea into a full functional
- [07:26] app. The reason why I emphasize so much
- [07:28] on this is because before we would see a
- [07:31] lot of people complaining about any sort
- [07:32] of tool that would have a payw wall and
- [07:35] it would basically restrict anyone from
- [07:38] generating or using AI for any sort of
- [07:41] use case. But with Google's tool sets
- [07:43] like Google AI studio or the build mode,
- [07:46] you have the opportunity to harness the
- [07:48] capabilities of these great models to
- [07:50] build anything completely for free. So I
- [07:53] definitely recommend that you try this
- [07:54] out. even try out anti-gravity, see if
- [07:57] that works for you. These are free tools
- [07:58] and you can make the most out of it. The
- [08:00] only thing that I would keep in mind is
- [08:03] that they might harvest data. So, that
- [08:05] is a potential concern that you should
- [08:08] keep in mind if you're working with
- [08:09] these tools. So, let me know what you
- [08:11] guys think. I'll leave these links in
- [08:12] the description below. Make sure you go
- [08:14] ahead and subscribe to the second
- [08:15] channel if you haven't already. Join the
- [08:16] newsletter. Join our private Discord.
- [08:18] Follow me on Twitter. And lastly, make
- [08:20] sure you guys subscribe, turn on
- [08:21] notification bell, like this video, and
- [08:23] please take a look at our previous
- [08:24] videos so that you can stay up to date
- [08:25] with the latest videos. But with that
- [08:27] thought, guys, have an amazing day,
- [08:28] spread positivity, and I'll see you guys
- [08:31] shortly. He suffers.
