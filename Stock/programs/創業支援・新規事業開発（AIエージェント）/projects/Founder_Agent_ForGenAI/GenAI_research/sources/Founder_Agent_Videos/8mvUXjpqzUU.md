- [00:00] Hey, so my name is Victor um Akiwandi.
- [00:03] I'm from Nigeria. [music]
- [00:05] I currently work at senior strategy
- [00:07] analyst for First Alli Capital Limited
- [00:09] in Nigeria. It's an investment bank in
- [00:12] Nigeria. However, before now, I have
- [00:15] worked as a business analyst. [music]
- [00:18] I've also worked as a business strate uh
- [00:20] business operations analyst [music] as
- [00:21] well. But currently, I'm occupying the
- [00:24] role of a strategy analyst. That's a
- [00:27] senior strategy analyst. Okay. So
- [00:29] essentially I just I wanted why I
- [00:32] decided to take up the course is because
- [00:33] I wanted to upskill. Um I've got [music]
- [00:36] to understand that some of the job um
- [00:40] requirements now requirements that you
- [00:42] [music] need to upskill. You need to get
- [00:44] knowledge from um some of these um
- [00:47] online training courses and the likes.
- [00:49] So I needed to make my work easier. I
- [00:52] needed to make it seamless and because I
- [00:54] equally wanted to improve in my
- [00:56] financials. does my salary as well. So I
- [01:00] take pick up the cost so that it's going
- [01:02] to help me as well because most um job
- [01:05] opportunities in the market requires
- [01:07] that you have uh the knowledge on um
- [01:11] skilled agile framework and um other
- [01:14] certifications [music] as well. So
- [01:16] that's why I said take up the course.
- [01:17] But my experience was great. Um it's
- [01:20] quite a just like I said before was very
- [01:23] interacting it was very in-depth [music]
- [01:26] um and a little bit was also very
- [01:29] practical because um the trainers were
- [01:32] awesome and having um for every exercise
- [01:36] I complete or module I complete I try to
- [01:39] put into practice or put into use or I
- [01:41] [music] try to relate it with certain um
- [01:45] with with certain case studies where
- [01:47] which has been very helpful. I remember
- [01:49] that um I was on a project at the time
- [01:52] and [music] I tried to just implement
- [01:54] what I've learned during the time to
- [01:56] also help expedite action on the project
- [01:59] and yes it made a very sickness for me
- [02:01] which I completed in no time and then I
- [02:04] remember that one of my senior [music]
- [02:08] um managers then cuz we were having a
- [02:11] conversation and I told him about it and
- [02:13] he he he recommended to him and I was
- [02:15] like he knows CN and it's actually a
- [02:17] very good uh platform form for me to
- [02:19] take up learnings and courses to
- [02:22] actually help improve my skills
- [02:25] professionally. So [music] that's ever
- [02:27] since then I decided to um throw more
- [02:29] energy into it and yes [music] here I am
- [02:32] today. Okay. So asideing the internet
- [02:35] cuz I have suffering the internet a lot
- [02:38] because I I just want to stay updated. I
- [02:40] want to get relevant information what is
- [02:42] happening in the world and all that. I I
- [02:44] like to drive. I love driving. And I
- [02:48] love I love traveling as well and I love
- [02:51] swimming. Yes, definitely. There are a
- [02:54] couple of courses um that allow [music]
- [02:57] um I think I'm currently on a project
- [03:00] although I've completed one um [music]
- [03:03] about um a week ago there about however
- [03:07] having to apply the safe um training
- [03:10] that I that I got from simply [music]
- [03:12] learn I was able to execute action on
- [03:14] that and the project was completed in no
- [03:17] time. So like I said
- [03:20] it has had a great impact on [music] my
- [03:22] on my projects. It has made the project
- [03:25] more structured. It has made it more
- [03:27] efficient for [music] me because I've
- [03:29] been able to implement agile practice
- [03:32] [music]
- [03:33] the principles for each and every
- [03:35] project which they make the whole um
- [03:40] alignment of the project difficult make
- [03:43] the development uh the operations and
- [03:46] even everything that contains the
- [03:48] project [music]
- [03:49] very effective efficient as well for me.
- [03:51] So yes
- [03:53] um protect that are supposed to take a
- [03:55] longer period took a shorter time
- [03:57] [music] the top management are very
- [03:59] excited and they are pleased. So
- [04:03] um it has [music] really helped me a lot
- [04:05] and that's just what I would say the
- [04:07] impact is just great.
