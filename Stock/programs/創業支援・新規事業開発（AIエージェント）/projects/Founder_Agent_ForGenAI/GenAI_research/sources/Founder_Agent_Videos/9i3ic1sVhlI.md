- [00:00] Cloud code is the most powerful coding
- [00:02] agent and general agent in the entire
- [00:05] world. In my opinion, it is the closest
- [00:07] thing that we have to AGI and Enthropic
- [00:10] just released a new feature to claude
- [00:12] code that brings us closer to AGI and
- [00:15] that is sub agents. I have not yet
- [00:17] tested sub aents and that's what we're
- [00:20] going to do today. We are going to
- [00:21] create a master agent who has a team of
- [00:25] smaller agents beneath it. So, I don't
- [00:27] want to waste any more time. Let's dive
- [00:29] into the video.
- [00:31] I created this kind of visual diagram
- [00:35] and this is kind of how I understand
- [00:36] what's happening. So basically when you
- [00:39] ask claude or chatgpt which are now
- [00:42] agents right they have access to tools
- [00:44] like browsing the internet but now you
- [00:46] can create agents that have a team of
- [00:50] sub aents and so the user asks the
- [00:52] primary agent. The primary agent
- [00:54] delegates to sub aents and the sub aents
- [00:57] respond to the primary agent. That is a
- [01:00] key distinction. The sub aents don't
- [01:02] respond back to you as a user. Primary
- [01:04] agent delegates to sub aents and the sub
- [01:07] aents report back to the primary agent
- [01:10] and the primary agent synthesizes that
- [01:13] information into a response that is
- [01:15] cited that shows attributions. It's very
- [01:18] clear where the information came from,
- [01:20] which sub agent. And this is built
- [01:22] directly into cloud code, which we're
- [01:24] going to set up in just a second.
- [01:26] Another cool fact about these sub
- [01:28] agents. After the user enters something
- [01:31] in or a query, the primary agent not
- [01:34] only delegates them like this, they're
- [01:36] actually delegated in parallel. So they
- [01:38] can happen at the same time, right? It
- [01:40] would be a lot more annoying, you know,
- [01:42] if they went 1 2 then three then four,
- [01:48] right? This would be a very annoying
- [01:50] process to basically work your way
- [01:53] through linearly and that's how a lot of
- [01:55] AIs have worked so far that have access
- [01:58] to tools. It's been quite linear and
- [02:00] that's why it takes so long. So this
- [02:02] primary agent can actually plan for
- [02:05] these agents to go off in parallel to do
- [02:07] tasks and then that gets its progress
- [02:09] report gets sent back to the primary
- [02:11] agent which can synthesize it so that
- [02:14] the user knows what's happening. Each
- [02:17] sub aent has a system prompt, a tool set
- [02:21] and a context window. And so many people
- [02:25] have understood the concept of context
- [02:27] window in terms of chat GBT. You might
- [02:29] have heard headlines about how Gemini's
- [02:31] new million token context window and
- [02:35] basically there's input tokens which are
- [02:37] how much you basically type into the AI
- [02:40] and then there's output tokens which is
- [02:42] how much the AI types back to you. So
- [02:47] like you have these chats going on. You
- [02:49] have your main chat. Let's call this
- [02:50] your main chat. And then you have this
- [02:53] agent that is has a better understanding
- [02:56] of your main chat. And that's your like
- [02:57] primary agent. If you think of this as a
- [03:00] max capacity or max tokens that fit into
- [03:02] a chat, you have these sub agents that
- [03:06] can process things without clouding your
- [03:09] massive context window because the role
- [03:12] of your primary agent is to synthesize
- [03:14] this information. It's distilling it
- [03:15] down to the important information and
- [03:17] that's what lives in the main chat here.
- [03:20] And so that's basically what's happening
- [03:22] with context window. Another thing
- [03:24] that's really important is your primary
- [03:26] agent will have access to tools and
- [03:29] it'll do things in a loop until it
- [03:31] decides that it's done. Then it will get
- [03:33] back to the user once it's decided that
- [03:35] it's done. And it can have access to
- [03:38] external tools. If you think of a tool
- [03:40] like cursor within cursor, if we were to
- [03:42] open some app here, I don't know. I
- [03:45] don't know what this is, but like if I
- [03:46] were to type into this side panel right
- [03:49] here, this this this is an agent right
- [03:52] here, but it has access to tools. It can
- [03:54] search my codebase. It can search the
- [03:55] web, search the web and make a change,
- [04:00] right? This is just a popular vibe
- [04:02] coding tool. I'm showing you an example.
- [04:03] And so, right now, it's planning. So,
- [04:05] it's using the thinking model, which all
- [04:07] of these models. And so, now it's
- [04:08] probably it's going to read this is a
- [04:10] tool. It's reading another file that is
- [04:12] the same tool but doing a different
- [04:14] thing. Now it's planning again and so
- [04:17] it'll run all these things. Now it's
- [04:18] doing a firecrawl search that was
- [04:20] another tool. Um now it's calling brave
- [04:24] search. So these are different tools
- [04:25] that it can use and it's using these
- [04:27] tools in a loop until it decides that
- [04:30] it's done. And that's kind of the way
- [04:32] that I conceptualize it and that's how
- [04:34] you give it agency. Right? in automation
- [04:36] is like kind of fixed where no matter
- [04:38] what it's going through once with this
- [04:41] right you can give it different tool
- [04:42] sets but one thing right with a primary
- [04:45] agent the more uh tools you add to an
- [04:50] agent the less consistent it becomes
- [04:54] let's say we had a master uh content
- [04:58] agent which I am actually currently
- [05:00] building right now that's probably for a
- [05:01] future episode uh if you gave it access
- [05:04] to it could post on X. It could post on
- [05:07] Insta. It could respond to DMs. If if it
- [05:11] had access to all of these different
- [05:12] tools, it would get very chaotic. If you
- [05:15] had like 50 tools it could have access
- [05:17] to because remember, it decides when to
- [05:20] use these different tools. That's what
- [05:22] makes it an agent, right? Your agent
- [05:24] when you give it a query, right?
- [05:26] Ideally, you want to give it a good
- [05:27] prompt. It will actually decide which of
- [05:30] these tools to use. And the more you
- [05:33] give it, the harder it is for it to be
- [05:35] correct in which tool to use. So the way
- [05:39] that Claude or Anthropic has decided to
- [05:41] solve this problem is to allow you to
- [05:43] create these sub agents where the
- [05:45] primary agent knows the function of the
- [05:47] sub aent, but it doesn't have to have
- [05:49] like detailed knowledge of all of the
- [05:52] tools it has access to. That's up to the
- [05:55] sub aent to know because the sub aent
- [05:56] doesn't even know what the primary agent
- [05:58] knows. the primary agent knows what the
- [06:01] sub agent needs to know and so that way
- [06:04] uh everything's faster. There is a
- [06:06] higher probability that the sub aent
- [06:08] will succeed because you can test the
- [06:10] sub aent independent of the whole
- [06:12] workflow so that you want to basically
- [06:14] maximize how frequently the sub aent
- [06:18] succeeds. And so the less tools you
- [06:20] give, the higher that percentage will
- [06:22] be. And then you just need to give
- [06:23] primary agent really good instructions
- [06:25] on how to use these sub aents and what
- [06:27] data to send to those sub aents. That's
- [06:29] what's really important. And so these
- [06:32] tools might be for one sub aent. So sub
- [06:35] agent one might have access to these
- [06:37] tools and sub aent two might have access
- [06:40] to these two tools. And that is kind of
- [06:44] what the tool set means. A different set
- [06:47] of abilities. These are functions uh
- [06:50] like calculators, APIs, executors, that
- [06:54] type of thing. And then of course all of
- [06:57] these have their own system prompt. So
- [06:59] the primary agent has a system prompt.
- [07:01] For those of you who have used chat GBT,
- [07:03] maybe you've created a custom project on
- [07:06] chat GBT or Claude or you've created
- [07:09] your your own custom space in
- [07:12] Perplexity. to create a custom um system
- [07:16] prompt for that project so that anytime
- [07:18] you ask something it has the necessary
- [07:20] context and every single one of these
- [07:24] has its own system prompt which would
- [07:27] include information about these tools.
- [07:30] You don't have to write one massive
- [07:32] system prompt. instead, right? You'll
- [07:34] write a system prompt for your primary
- [07:35] agent. And that system prompt will uh
- [07:39] basically give context of what sub aents
- [07:43] that it has. This is just a good way to
- [07:45] conceptualize it. But like you basically
- [07:47] your job is to tell the primary agent
- [07:51] what sub aents it can delegate to. And
- [07:55] then with the sub aents, your job is to
- [07:58] make sure that it uses the tools
- [08:01] effectively, that it follows the
- [08:03] instructions of this primary agent
- [08:05] effectively. Each one of these sub aents
- [08:07] has their own system instructions that
- [08:09] it uses every single time. And it's very
- [08:13] very important if this is an agent you
- [08:15] want to use over and over again or use
- [08:16] in a way that's fully automated, then
- [08:19] you should spend tons of time writing
- [08:21] these system instructions and making
- [08:23] sure that it uses these tools and
- [08:25] follows instructions effectively so that
- [08:27] you can just let it run autonomously.
- [08:28] And if it's a profitable activity, you
- [08:30] can just turn it up. You can give it
- [08:31] more tokens. Um, and if it is something
- [08:34] that benefits a company, you could run
- [08:36] it forever. And that's one thing that
- [08:38] makes agents more effective than human
- [08:40] employees. If you find something that
- [08:41] works, you can. It's a lot easier to
- [08:43] turn it up than to turn up the
- [08:45] activities a good employee does because
- [08:47] you would need to duplicate them, which
- [08:49] is not possible. And that is why I'm so
- [08:52] excited. So now what we're going to do
- [08:54] is we are going to test this. And to
- [08:56] test this, you need to download NodeJS.
- [08:59] Then what you need to do is you need to
- [09:00] copy this right here. And what we're
- [09:03] going to do is we are going to um open
- [09:08] up terminal because remember this runs
- [09:12] in the terminal. And so I'm going to go
- [09:14] to a new desktop.
- [09:16] And what I'm going to do is I have my
- [09:18] terminal open right here. And in order
- [09:22] to access cla code, all you have to do
- [09:24] is type cloud. But if you haven't yet
- [09:26] downloaded cloud code, you need to paste
- [09:28] this in right here and press enter to
- [09:30] download the latest version. And that
- [09:32] will allow you to download Claude Code.
- [09:34] Since I've already done that, I'm not
- [09:35] going to do that. All I need to do is
- [09:37] type in Claude. So now we can talk to
- [09:39] Claude Code. And remember, if you watch
- [09:42] my last video, you know that Claude Code
- [09:44] controls files on my computer. It is a
- [09:47] command line interface, and it is a lot
- [09:49] easier once you start using it. Once you
- [09:51] realize that it can just create any type
- [09:53] of file, you kind of realize the power
- [09:55] of this software, right? Let's go ahead
- [09:58] and go into our documents folder and
- [10:01] create a folder in my documents folder
- [10:06] called testing sub aents. And so this is
- [10:10] going to create a file in the documents.
- [10:13] There we go. Testing sub aents. And we
- [10:15] see that we can go into this folder.
- [10:19] Now I want to use the new claw code sub
- [10:24] agents feature. Search the web. Tell me
- [10:28] about this new feature and put it in a
- [10:33] markdown. Simple explanations and simple
- [10:38] bullets. But first, please make sure I
- [10:42] have the latest
- [10:45] version of clawed code.
- [10:48] Now, it should give it a list of to-dos.
- [10:51] And remember, this is just the the the
- [10:53] main agent. We have not yet used sub
- [10:56] aents. And so sometimes you need to give
- [10:57] it uh permissions, right? It'll be like,
- [11:00] do you want to proceed? I just always
- [11:02] press yes. But we're just going to go
- [11:04] ahead and we are running cloud code
- [11:06] here. Do you wish to create this
- [11:08] markdown file? And I'm going to hit yes.
- [11:12] And there we go. Look at this. Cloud
- [11:15] code sub aents. Now we have this clean
- [11:17] markdown file. So sub aents are
- [11:20] specialized AI assistants in cloud code
- [11:22] that handle specific types of tasks.
- [11:25] They work like having different experts
- [11:28] for different jobs each with their own
- [11:30] focus and tools. Very very interesting.
- [11:34] Very cool. Now what I want to do is I
- [11:38] want to move to an IDE. For those of you
- [11:43] who have never written any code, this
- [11:45] part might get a little bit weird
- [11:46] because we're opening up a coding tool
- [11:48] um called cursor. We're going to open up
- [11:50] a new window and we are going to open
- [11:54] project and we're going to open the
- [11:55] project at the same location that we
- [11:58] just created the project which was
- [11:59] testing sub aents open and an IDE allows
- [12:02] you to see the files cuz remember coding
- [12:04] is just files on your computer just like
- [12:07] you know Microsoft Word doc and so
- [12:09] instead of you looking at this view
- [12:10] we're going to be looking at this view
- [12:11] cuz it's a lot easier to just very
- [12:13] quickly see the different things and so
- [12:16] what we're going to do is we're going to
- [12:17] click model and I'm going to switch to
- [12:20] Opus. This one is a lot more expensive.
- [12:23] So, if you want to save money, don't use
- [12:25] Opus. But what I'm going to do is I want
- [12:28] you to search the internet more. Find
- [12:33] someone's GitHub repo template for
- [12:38] inspiration and GitHub. They uh people
- [12:40] create these agents. And by the way,
- [12:42] these agents are created with files,
- [12:44] right? These are just files on your
- [12:46] computer. And you can create these
- [12:47] agents just by creating markdown files
- [12:49] on your computer. And that's what I'm
- [12:50] getting to. We are literally just going
- [12:52] to create files. And remember, this
- [12:54] might look scary, but all this is is
- [12:55] just markdown. And markdown is just a
- [12:58] special way of text. It just turns these
- [13:00] hashtags into headings. It's nothing
- [13:02] crazy, nothing special. They're just
- [13:04] little files. And we're going to create
- [13:05] these agents by creating these files.
- [13:08] And what we're going to do here is we
- [13:10] are looking for someone's existing file
- [13:13] base or code base on GitHub who set up
- [13:16] sub aents. And so we're going to look at
- [13:17] it for inspiration. Then I want you to
- [13:20] guide me to setting up my first sub
- [13:24] agent on claude code right now using the
- [13:29] agent command. Please tell me how to do
- [13:33] it and put it in a markdown file in this
- [13:38] folder. I was going to have it created,
- [13:40] but I actually want to use the new agent
- [13:42] cuz there's there should be a new agent.
- [13:45] So, yeah, you can create you can set up
- [13:46] agents, but I actually want Opus to do
- [13:49] some research and then I want to uh set
- [13:52] up the agent manually right here. And
- [13:54] so, we're going to have AI teach us how
- [13:56] to do it. And what's really cool is
- [13:58] we're actually going to be able to set
- [14:00] different colors. So it'll actually show
- [14:02] them in the terminal here as different
- [14:03] colors when you create sub aents. But
- [14:05] for now, let's just wait for it to be
- [14:07] done getting research.
- [14:08] >> A few moments later.
- [14:10] >> Okay. So here we are setting up your
- [14:12] first cloud code sub aent. And so now we
- [14:14] can actually type in /tag or slash
- [14:17] agents. And we're going to do this
- [14:19] within the project. So you can either
- [14:21] create this. This is more globally or
- [14:24] within the project. I'm going to do
- [14:25] project and I am going to do generate
- [14:28] with claude. And now describe what you
- [14:31] want this agent to be able to do. So I
- [14:34] want this agent to be able to post on X
- [14:40] using the X API. Please put placeholders
- [14:45] in for the keys that I need. I'll give
- [14:51] them to you in just one second. And so I
- [14:56] want one of these tools to be able to
- [14:58] post on X. And this is just one tool
- [15:02] that will give to one of the sub aents.
- [15:04] And you could just make this a tool for
- [15:05] one of the agents, but I think we should
- [15:07] keep this Twitter agent separate. And so
- [15:10] it is now generating the configuration.
- [15:12] So I actually want to as we're building
- [15:14] this out, I want to keep track of what
- [15:17] we're creating. So, I'm going to go over
- [15:18] here and if I'm trying to design a chief
- [15:22] marketing officer, agent, CMO, agent.
- [15:25] What I want to do is I want to create
- [15:27] over time, we're going to start with
- [15:29] very simple tasks. And in this video,
- [15:31] we're creating just like the first part.
- [15:33] Maybe I'll make this a multi-part
- [15:34] series, but we're creating the CMO agent
- [15:36] and we're giving him access to the
- [15:39] Twitter agent. And these will, of
- [15:41] course, run in parallel, but for now, we
- [15:43] haven't created anything else. We
- [15:45] haven't created this. We'll delete
- [15:47] these. Okay, we're creating the agent.
- [15:50] And so then this Twitter agent will have
- [15:53] tools which part of the tools that it
- [15:55] has are posting on the API. It'll
- [15:56] generate system instructions and it will
- [15:59] also have its own context window. And so
- [16:04] that is kind of how this is being
- [16:06] organized. And this Twitter agent,
- [16:07] that's where it fits in. So now what
- [16:10] we're going to do is let's go ahead and
- [16:11] make this red, actually blue for
- [16:14] Twitter. So now we can actually select a
- [16:15] color. This will be blue and here X API
- [16:19] poster. In fact, let's just use that.
- [16:21] Let's go ahead and uh just call it X API
- [16:25] poster. This will be the name of the
- [16:26] agent. You are an expert. X formally
- [16:28] Twitter API integration specialist. You
- [16:30] handle all of the posting content to X
- [16:33] and your core responsibilities etc etc.
- [16:36] Okay. Was this created? The key steps to
- [16:38] create your first sub agent. Okay. Um
- [16:41] create new agent. Now we should have a
- [16:43] image generator agent that uses the FAL
- [16:49] API. I want to be able to use the most
- [16:54] popular image and video generators. Pick
- [16:59] one image gen and one video gen and put
- [17:04] them as tools in the And we can name it.
- [17:08] I know I'm typing into the ether here,
- [17:10] but bear with me. We'll call this image
- [17:12] gen agent. Okay. So we have this Twitter
- [17:15] agent and part of the tools one of these
- [17:17] tools is the X the X API. And so this
- [17:20] tool right here requires in any API
- [17:23] requires an API key and then sometimes
- [17:26] like other tokens like uh user ID in X
- [17:30] API's case it's kind of many different
- [17:33] uh keys actually. I think it's like four
- [17:35] keys that you need access to which it's
- [17:37] kind of annoying. But in the second
- [17:39] agent here, and we're actually going to
- [17:41] uh hit uh continue, and we will make
- [17:45] this one green. And this is the image
- [17:48] gen agent, which is green. Uh we'll have
- [17:52] access to tools. And these tools will be
- [17:56] FAL, which is a provider that gives you
- [17:59] access to many different image gen or
- [18:01] videogen. And we're going to give it an
- [18:03] FAL API key. That's what we're going to
- [18:05] need to give it. And these are all keys
- [18:07] that are specific. But right, the
- [18:09] Twitter agent won't have any knowledge
- [18:11] of the API keys. And the master agent
- [18:14] won't have that in its context either.
- [18:17] That is just for these sub agents to
- [18:19] know. Okay. Three agents created. Okay.
- [18:21] Create new. I don't want to create new
- [18:23] agent. I just Let's hit enter. View
- [18:24] agent. Okay. Great. Now, okay. Put the
- [18:28] agents in the codebase files in testing
- [18:33] sub agents. And so now it is copying
- [18:35] those folders into here. So what I'm
- [18:38] going to do is I'm about to give it
- [18:40] access to all of my API keys. And
- [18:44] actually um I want to actually create
- [18:46] one more agent and I'm going to make
- [18:48] this really quickly. Create new agent.
- [18:50] We're going to put it in the project.
- [18:51] We're going to generate with claude
- [18:53] research agent that researches the web
- [18:56] quickly about any topic. This is just a
- [19:00] test. So, I want to just test using one
- [19:02] of these tools without putting my API
- [19:04] keys in yet. But this is basically the
- [19:07] image generator MD. It's generating the
- [19:10] image. Okay, cool. Okay, now we're just
- [19:12] going to hit continue. And let's just
- [19:13] make this cyan. Okay, now put this agent
- [19:17] in this project and run this agent to
- [19:22] search. Please do this correctly. Like
- [19:26] I've never done this before. I want to
- [19:31] be able to use these agents. So set up
- [19:36] the project of testing sub agents so
- [19:40] that this works as anthropic wants it to
- [19:46] work. Please set up the codebase
- [19:49] correctly based on best practices,
- [19:53] please. Okay, so I wanted to put the
- [19:55] agent information in here. So, it's like
- [19:58] copy the uh web research specialist. All
- [20:01] right. So, I'm just going to very
- [20:02] quickly add that to our little thing
- [20:04] here. We have this web research
- [20:06] specialist as a sub agent that will be
- [20:09] the CMO agent cuz we need to create the
- [20:11] master agent as well. And that is what
- [20:14] we uh we need to do. So, it just added
- [20:16] something. Now, it has a claude with an
- [20:19] agents folder within it. So, hasclaude
- [20:21] and it has agents in it. Okay. So, I
- [20:24] think it's going to put the agents in
- [20:25] this folder right here. So, it put the
- [20:27] web research specialist in there. I hope
- [20:29] it puts the other two in there as well.
- [20:32] Okay. So, name Revs researcher
- [20:34] specialist. The description is use this
- [20:36] agent when. So, in the sub agent, you
- [20:40] put a description of the agent in here
- [20:42] and that will tell the main agent when
- [20:45] to use that. So, that's good to know.
- [20:46] What are the latest developments? Okay,
- [20:48] so these are examples. That's very
- [20:50] interesting. Commentary. Since the user
- [20:52] is asking for the latest development
- [20:53] which require up-to-ate information, use
- [20:54] the web research specialist agent to
- [20:56] research this topic. Okay, cool.
- [20:58] Amazing. So that makes sense. And then
- [21:00] here is you are an expert research
- [21:02] specialist with exceptional skills at
- [21:04] finding, evaluating, and synthesizing
- [21:05] information. And there we go. We've
- [21:07] created this agent that we can use.
- [21:09] Okay. So now it's created this claude MD
- [21:12] file. And so this project demonstrates
- [21:14] the proper setup and usage of cloud code
- [21:16] sub aents following anthropics best
- [21:18] practices. And here it has the project
- [21:21] structure. So this Claude MD is whenever
- [21:24] I ask something to Claude, this is kind
- [21:26] of this main agent that now fully
- [21:29] understands the codebase. And here we
- [21:32] can see the web research specialist
- [21:33] which is highlighted. I think it's doing
- [21:35] a test. Let me test the web research
- [21:37] specialist agent with real research to
- [21:40] ensure everything is working correctly.
- [21:42] That's very cool. Um so now we have this
- [21:45] web research specialist and it's
- [21:46] highlighted. So in this interface, the
- [21:48] CLI interface, we can see which agent is
- [21:50] working and it is searching for AI agent
- [21:53] 2025 companies leaders blah blah blah.
- [21:55] And that's very cool. And so while it's
- [21:58] working, what we can do here and within
- [22:00] cursor, we can actually create a new
- [22:02] folder. And we can say let's just call
- [22:04] this outputs. And just to be consistent,
- [22:08] we'll call this outputs. And we can have
- [22:09] the agent put the outputs, anything that
- [22:12] it outputs in the outputs folder. And
- [22:14] yeah, that's what we can do. I just made
- [22:17] a new folder called sensitive keys. So I
- [22:20] just created these sensitive keys. I do
- [22:22] not want these uh I do not want to show
- [22:25] you this folder because they are indeed
- [22:26] sensitive keys. So what I'm going to do
- [22:28] right now is I'm going to go to claude
- [22:32] code and remember these keys are right
- [22:34] here, right? The X API key and then the
- [22:36] FAL API key. This these are tools,
- [22:39] right? So, okay, I want to finish
- [22:42] setting up the uh API keys. I want to
- [22:46] finish setting up the uh API keys for X
- [22:49] and for FAL. Please search both. Use the
- [22:55] normal research tool, not the web
- [22:58] research specialist for whatever reason
- [23:01] that wants to research for a very long
- [23:03] time. And I think by looking at the
- [23:04] prompt, I understand why. just find the
- [23:06] docs, get it set up so the X API agent
- [23:11] can post and the image generator uh
- [23:16] agent can generate images and videos um
- [23:21] when it needs to. Please set up these
- [23:26] tools properly. Oh, wait. I never told
- [23:28] it about the sensitive keys. I'm going
- [23:30] to stop it and say I put all the keys
- [23:33] for everything in the sensitive keys.md
- [23:39] file. This file has all the keys. Now I
- [23:43] configure the keys. Let me update the
- [23:45] agent configuration. It configured the
- [23:47] API keys. Now it's creating example
- [23:49] scripts showing how to use the agents.
- [23:52] Okay, your agents are ready to use.
- [23:54] Okay, so by the way, I already have a
- [23:56] chief marketing officer Twitter account
- [23:59] here. So, we'll zoom way in. We are
- [24:01] going to be using Vibe Mo. Vibe Mo is my
- [24:04] automated AI agent, CMO VI um agent that
- [24:08] that's what these keys are set up to.
- [24:10] So, this is the account that it will
- [24:12] likely be tweeting to. I'm going to
- [24:13] test. Please delegate to the exposter
- [24:16] agent to post. Hi there. This is the
- [24:20] first time I'm using sub agents. Okay.
- [24:25] So, ideally, it should use the correct
- [24:27] agent. The agent is blue. Remember, we
- [24:30] selected the blue color. So, we can see
- [24:32] the X API poster. That is very cool.
- [24:34] Okay. Your tweet has been posted. The X
- [24:37] API poster has successfully posted the
- [24:39] image. Hi there. This is the first time
- [24:41] I'm using sub agents. Let's see if this
- [24:43] is true. And by the way, this is where I
- [24:47] am. I'm on the developer portal. Uh,
- [24:49] this is where you'll find all of the
- [24:50] information that you need. And they're
- [24:52] in the keys and tokens. So, that's
- [24:54] what's going on here. But right now, I'm
- [24:56] going to go to Twitter. I'm going to see
- [24:58] if it actually tweeted. Hi there. This
- [25:01] is the first time I'm using sub agents.
- [25:03] Okay. So now what we need to do here is
- [25:06] we need to verify. And it even said that
- [25:08] like it even put the status here, right?
- [25:11] We can actually see this. What I want to
- [25:13] do now is I want to go back to this
- [25:17] right here. So let's just keep little
- [25:19] notes on here. So we got this working.
- [25:22] The web research one takes a long time,
- [25:24] but I do think it's working. But what we
- [25:26] haven't gotten working is this image
- [25:27] generator agent. So we need to get this
- [25:29] image generator agent working. So now I
- [25:32] want you to please get the image
- [25:37] generator working and generate an image
- [25:41] of a turtle flying through space with an
- [25:47] advanced
- [25:49] image model. and please put it in the
- [25:54] outputs folder. After you do that, make
- [25:57] sure to add instructions in all
- [26:00] necessary places to make sure that all
- [26:03] of the image outputs end up in the
- [26:05] outputs folder. So you see here, these
- [26:07] are all files and we're just creating
- [26:09] these files for agents and giving these
- [26:12] files access to tools. And by giving
- [26:15] access to these tools, it can take
- [26:17] actions which generates more files and
- [26:19] puts them and keeps them organized. And
- [26:21] if you have good instructions as you
- [26:23] generate more things, generate more
- [26:24] tweets, right? It can actually go out on
- [26:26] the internet and uh generate new things.
- [26:28] Hi, this is the first time I'm using sub
- [26:30] agents. That's pretty cool. All right,
- [26:32] so it is generating a turtle in space.
- [26:35] Hopefully, it's just generating an
- [26:36] image. Test image video generator agent
- [26:38] with a turtle in space prompt. Update
- [26:40] agent configuration to save outputs
- [26:42] folder. Okay, so for this we are using
- [26:45] FAL's API. They have a bunch of
- [26:48] different models. So we can actually hit
- [26:50] explore and we are going to do text to
- [26:53] image. Bria text to image right here. Uh
- [26:58] let's see if what happens when we run
- [26:59] this. Let's see what it's doing. Oh,
- [27:01] outputs. Is there an output in here? Oh,
- [27:03] there's a space turtle output. Okay,
- [27:05] look at that. We have this space turtle.
- [27:07] Very cool. Now what I want to do is
- [27:10] update the agent configuration to save
- [27:12] outputs to the folder. Okay. Now please
- [27:15] update the uh image video generator
- [27:20] based on what you learned right because
- [27:22] it failed at the beginning. I don't know
- [27:24] why it failed at the beginning but then
- [27:26] it ended up successfully generating it
- [27:28] with what you learned. The space Oh, I
- [27:31] don't think we can add code files. The
- [27:33] space turtle image was successful. I
- [27:37] want it to be successful every time. Oh,
- [27:41] update the documentation with folder
- [27:44] instructions. Okay. Yeah, that's just
- [27:46] that part. Then I want you to generate a
- [27:50] new image of a similar style except make
- [27:56] it a panda because the um vibe is a
- [28:01] panda of a panda flying through space.
- [28:05] And please make a twos sentence tweet
- [28:09] along with this image like post the
- [28:12] image on Twitter and make it about how
- [28:15] you delegated to these sub aents and
- [28:20] describe what tools you used. Okay,
- [28:23] that's a really confusing prompt but uh
- [28:26] it's opus so it's very powerful. We
- [28:28] should probably switch back to sonnet
- [28:30] and we should probably condense our
- [28:32] context or switch to a new chat. So this
- [28:34] is what it's going to do. It's going to
- [28:36] update the image video generator. So the
- [28:38] the the cloud code is going through your
- [28:40] files the same way you know the cursor
- [28:42] agent is. But now we can delegate to any
- [28:45] of these agents that are in this.cloud/
- [28:47] aents folder and we can see which agent
- [28:50] is working based on what color is
- [28:51] showing up here. And so the plan is to
- [28:54] update the imple implementation details.
- [28:57] I wanted it to update this based on what
- [28:58] it learned. Then it's going to generate
- [29:00] an image of a panda. It's going to put
- [29:02] it in the outputs folder hopefully just
- [29:05] like it did with the space turtle. And
- [29:06] then it's going to create a tweet with
- [29:07] the sub aent describing what tools it
- [29:09] used to create the tweet and post the
- [29:11] tweet with the image to X. Let's see. So
- [29:13] right now it's generating the image. We
- [29:14] can see which sub aent is working. Okay,
- [29:17] it generated the space panda. There we
- [29:19] go. We have this space panda. It's been
- [29:22] generated. I don't know which model that
- [29:24] it's using but now it's going to post it
- [29:26] on X and ideally
- [29:31] okay generate the space Panda okay
- [29:33] create the tweet about sub aents cuz
- [29:35] remember I asked it to describe the flow
- [29:37] and then it should post it on X now it's
- [29:40] initializing the X API poster and it is
- [29:44] hopefully able to post it with the image
- [29:46] we may run into problems with the image
- [29:48] um I'm not sure if it's going to be able
- [29:50] to convert it into the right format to
- [29:52] get it posted But we will see. Let's
- [29:54] see. Okay, it claims that it's posted it
- [29:57] on X. Let me see if it gives us a tweet.
- [29:59] Okay, your tweet is live. Let's see if
- [30:02] this works. So, I'm going to refresh it
- [30:04] here. Wow, there we go. just delegated
- [30:08] image generation to my image to video
- [30:10] generator sub aent using claude's claude
- [30:13] codes task tool which called the FAL
- [30:15] flux model API created whimsical state
- [30:18] sub aent to handle specialized tax
- [30:20] independently making complex workflows
- [30:23] simple and efficient. All right, this is
- [30:27] going to get fun. Amazing. So Vibe Mo,
- [30:31] my automated chief marketing officer now
- [30:35] has tools, right? It has three tools.
- [30:37] Image video generator, web research
- [30:40] specialist, and X API poster. And it can
- [30:42] now in one command I had it generate
- [30:45] this and then post it on X. This is a
- [30:47] very simple example. This is not that
- [30:49] complicated of an agent, right? And we
- [30:52] did finish this right here. We have this
- [30:54] chief marketing officer agent that has
- [30:56] access to sub aents. And these agents
- [30:58] aren't that hard. You could have had one
- [30:59] singular agent to do all of this. But if
- [31:02] we had access to all of my social media
- [31:04] accounts and my notion and my buffer,
- [31:07] which is the place where I manage
- [31:08] manually manage all of my social media
- [31:10] accounts and it could post thumbnail
- [31:12] ideas for my video as well as research
- [31:14] for my podcast as well as everything,
- [31:16] right? This will get bigger and bigger
- [31:18] and so ViMo is the first iteration of
- [31:22] this agent, right? This is my chief
- [31:25] marketing officer and I started this
- [31:26] about two week uh 2 days ago where it's
- [31:28] claude code running 24 hours a day and
- [31:31] so it posts only once an hour and these
- [31:33] tweets are not that good yet but it's
- [31:35] going to start doing more and more
- [31:36] things. It's going to have an Instagram
- [31:38] account. It's going to have a Twitter
- [31:39] account. It's going to be able to
- [31:40] message people on our team. Right? I
- [31:41] work at a startup and we have nine
- [31:43] people now and I was the chief marketing
- [31:45] officer as as a co-founder. I want to
- [31:47] spend more time creating content because
- [31:49] I think that is a higher leverage thing
- [31:51] for me to be working on instead of being
- [31:53] the chief marketing officer and looking
- [31:55] at analytics all the time. I think it's
- [31:57] a waste of time at this stage of a
- [31:58] startup. I just think you can get AI to
- [32:00] do it. And so that's what we're going to
- [32:02] attempt to do. So eventually Vimo is
- [32:05] going to have hundreds of tools but not
- [32:07] in its main agent. It's going to have
- [32:08] sub agents that it can delegate to that
- [32:11] have access to those different tools.
- [32:12] And we are going to see how smart we can
- [32:15] get it. And instead of me sending in my
- [32:17] own manual ideas every day, it's going
- [32:20] to be triggered automatically to take
- [32:22] tasks and to choose the best task to
- [32:24] take. And I think this is a pretty good
- [32:27] little short overview/entertaining
- [32:30] video to kind of get your juices flowing
- [32:33] around agents, right? How can you get an
- [32:35] agent to delegate to smaller versions of
- [32:38] itself to accomplish more? And when you
- [32:40] start thinking about your business or
- [32:42] your life in this way, especially once
- [32:44] you get it on a schedule, you realize
- [32:46] how high leverage it is. Because if you
- [32:48] are able to create these little
- [32:50] workflows within an agent that run all
- [32:52] the time, it starts just working for you
- [32:54] in the background of your life, it's
- [32:56] like passive productivity. And the more
- [32:58] time you put up upfront and the more
- [33:00] time you spend paying really close
- [33:01] attention to the tools, the system
- [33:03] instructions and the context window of
- [33:05] your sub agents as well as your master
- [33:08] agent, the more leverage you can get
- [33:09] from these activities. And I didn't
- [33:11] really go into like absolute best
- [33:12] practices. We had AI create them.
- [33:14] Luckily, I work at a company where we
- [33:16] have really smart people and we're
- [33:18] actually going to create these agents.
- [33:19] And so in a future video, maybe next
- [33:21] week, we're going to go through what I
- [33:22] learn and maybe with the CTO of my
- [33:25] company, we'll actually dive deep into
- [33:27] the best practices for system
- [33:29] instructions for both your master agent
- [33:31] and your sub agents. And I'm really
- [33:33] excited to make future videos and make
- [33:35] Vibe, the chief marketing officer,
- [33:37] better. And so that's what we're going
- [33:39] to do. Make sure to subscribe and like
- [33:41] this video. And I'll see you here for
- [33:43] the next video.
