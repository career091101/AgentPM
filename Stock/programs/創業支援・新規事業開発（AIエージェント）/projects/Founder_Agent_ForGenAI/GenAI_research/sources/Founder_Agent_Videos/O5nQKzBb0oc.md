- [00:00] Hello everybody. In this lesson, we're
- [00:01] going to be taking a look at operators.
- [00:03] Now, operators in R are just symbols or
- [00:06] keywords that perform operations on
- [00:08] variables or values if you haven't
- [00:10] already put those values into a
- [00:12] variable. Now, we're going to take a
- [00:13] look at several different types of
- [00:15] operators. But if you've been following
- [00:17] along in this series, we've already used
- [00:19] an operator before. It was something
- [00:21] called an assignment operator. So, if we
- [00:23] have our variable and we go like this,
- [00:27] this is an assignment operator. These
- [00:29] are characters that say when we put a 42
- [00:33] over here, this 42 is going to stay
- [00:36] within this variable. So this already is
- [00:38] something that we know. So that is an
- [00:41] assignment operator. Now the next one
- [00:44] that we're going to take a look at is an
- [00:46] arithmetic and I spell this right
- [00:49] operator. There are other ones as well
- [00:51] like comparison operators and logical
- [00:54] operators and we'll get to those in just
- [00:55] a little bit. But let's start out with
- [00:57] looking at arithmetic operators. These
- [01:00] are operators that are specifically
- [01:01] built and designed for math. And so
- [01:03] let's declare two different variables
- [01:06] just to start. And then we'll take a
- [01:07] look at these arithmetic operators. So
- [01:09] let's just do the classic x and y. We'll
- [01:12] say x is 10 and we'll say y is 3. Now
- [01:19] let's go ahead and declare those. We're
- [01:20] going to see in our environment right
- [01:21] over here. We have our x and our y.
- [01:24] Within these variables, we have the very
- [01:27] basic ones. We're going to take our
- [01:29] variables. We're going to say x + y. And
- [01:32] this is going to be, of course, 13. Now,
- [01:35] what we can do, by the way, is we can
- [01:38] assign this to another variable. So, if
- [01:40] we wanted to, we can say a is going to
- [01:43] be assigned x + y. And if we run that, x
- [01:46] + y is 13. So, a becomes 13. Now, we
- [01:51] don't have to do that every time we do
- [01:53] any type of operator or mathematical
- [01:56] equation, but if we want to store that
- [01:58] value, we can. And this may not look
- [02:00] like it makes sense, but it does make
- [02:02] sense because we've stored these values.
- [02:04] We're adding them together, and then we
- [02:07] are assigning them. So, that is just
- [02:09] simple uh x + y, but we can also do x
- [02:13] minus y. This is just subtraction, and
- [02:16] we're going to get seven. So, that's 10
- [02:17] - 3 is equal to 7. We also have
- [02:20] multiplication which if we do x * 10 and
- [02:24] that's the little star right here. So
- [02:26] that is on my keyboard the shift 8. If
- [02:30] we do x and sorry it's supposed to be uh
- [02:33] x * y we're going to get 30. And so
- [02:36] we're just multiplying them together. We
- [02:38] have one more of the basic ones and then
- [02:40] we'll start going to the kind of the
- [02:41] more complicated ones. But that's
- [02:43] division. So, we're going to say x and
- [02:45] then we're going to do a forward slash
- [02:48] y. And this is going to be x / y. And
- [02:51] that's
- [02:52] 3.3333 because it's 3 into 10. Now, the
- [02:56] next one that we're going to look at is
- [02:57] a little bit more challenging. This is
- [02:59] an exponent or to the power of. So, it
- [03:01] would be x and we're going to do this
- [03:03] little carrot here. That's what it's
- [03:05] called. It's called a carrot. X to the
- [03:07] power of y. So, we're going to do 10 to
- [03:09] the power of three. So, be 10 x * 10 *
- [03:11] 10. And so when we do that, we're going
- [03:13] to get 1,00. So that one's really good.
- [03:16] I'm sure you've seen that if you've
- [03:17] taken algebra or, you know, other types
- [03:20] of maths, you're going to recognize that
- [03:22] pretty quickly. But this next one is
- [03:23] most likely one that you haven't seen.
- [03:25] This is called a modulo. And what it
- [03:27] does is it takes the remainder of a
- [03:29] division. So if we do x and we're going
- [03:32] to do two percent signs of y. If we run
- [03:37] this, we're going to do 10 / 3, which
- [03:40] means three can go into 10, but we have
- [03:42] a remainder of one. And so that's what a
- [03:45] modulo is used for. Now, I will say
- [03:48] you're going to use these a lot. They're
- [03:50] fairly straightforward. They're not
- [03:52] crazy confusing. This is kind of
- [03:54] foundational math that most people
- [03:55] should know. If you haven't, just mess
- [03:57] around with those. Uh those are really
- [03:59] good to know. Now, I'm not going to dive
- [04:00] into it a lot, but have you ever heard
- [04:03] of PEMDOS? This is the order of
- [04:05] operations within math. This is
- [04:08] something you need to be aware of
- [04:09] because if you do something like, and
- [04:12] I'm just going to use numbers. I'm going
- [04:13] to do five * 10. If we do it just like
- [04:16] this and we run it, of course, that's
- [04:19] going to be 50. But then, let's do
- [04:22] divided by 2 and let's run this. Now, of
- [04:26] course, that's going to be 25. But if I
- [04:29] add plus six here and we run this, this
- [04:33] is where it starts getting a little
- [04:34] complicated, right? What's happening
- [04:36] where and what's going to happen if I
- [04:39] add a parentheses around all of this? So
- [04:42] this is where PEMDOSS comes into play.
- [04:44] PEMDOS stands for parenthesis, exponent,
- [04:46] multiplication, division, addition,
- [04:48] subtraction. So if we are looking at
- [04:51] this, we have to start with the P, the
- [04:53] parenthesis. So, we're going to do
- [04:54] everything in this parenthesis first
- [04:57] before we do anything outside of the
- [04:59] parentheses, which is multiplying times
- [05:01] 5. We would also do the exponent, which
- [05:03] we don't have, multiplication, which is
- [05:05] not in the parenthesis. And then
- [05:07] division. So, we would divide 10 by 2,
- [05:09] which is 5. Then, we would add six,
- [05:11] which is 11 * 5 is 55. Let's make sure
- [05:14] that's correct. And there we go. If we
- [05:17] did it in a different way, if we uh put
- [05:20] the parentheses over here, and let's get
- [05:22] rid of this real quick. If we put the
- [05:24] parentheses over here, now we're going
- [05:26] to multiply in times 50, then divide by
- [05:29] two and add six, and that's going to be
- [05:32] 31 because we're going to get 25 right
- [05:34] here, and then add six to it. And so
- [05:37] these parentheses are very important.
- [05:39] You will see these in different types of
- [05:41] equations and different types of math
- [05:42] that you'll work with within R as it is
- [05:44] very statistics heavy. So, you know,
- [05:46] this is just kind of foundational
- [05:47] arithmetic and math that you need to
- [05:49] know in order to work with these types
- [05:51] of programming languages. The next one
- [05:52] that we're going to take a look at, and
- [05:54] let's give us some more room right here,
- [05:56] and these are going to be comparison
- [05:59] operators. Comparison operators allow
- [06:01] you to evaluate different conditions.
- [06:04] So, let's take a look at one. So, we
- [06:06] have x and y here. We created those
- [06:09] earlier. So, we're going to say x is
- [06:11] greater than y. Now, when we run this,
- [06:14] we're going to get a different output.
- [06:16] We're no longer going to get a string or
- [06:18] a number. Now, we're getting what's
- [06:20] called a boolean
- [06:22] value. Now, this boolean is either true
- [06:25] or it is false. So, now if we say x is
- [06:29] less than y and we run this, and I did
- [06:32] an uppercase, whoops, let's go ahead and
- [06:35] run this. Now, we're going to get a
- [06:37] false. So depending on whether it is a
- [06:41] true condition, it evaluates to true or
- [06:43] it evaluates to false, that's what our
- [06:45] output is going to be. Now we can also
- [06:48] add in to these ones an equal than or an
- [06:50] equal uh as well. So it would say x is
- [06:53] less than or equal to y. And if we run
- [06:55] it, it's still going to be false, but we
- [06:57] can add that in if you want that these
- [07:00] uh to potentially be equal or you want
- [07:02] to check for that. The other ones that
- [07:04] you really need to know are x is equal
- [07:07] to y. Now this is wrong uh because this
- [07:12] is actually an assignment operator just
- [07:14] like let's go back up. This is in
- [07:16] certain conditions within R. We need to
- [07:19] say equal equal. This is actually what
- [07:22] you need to write. And so it may seem a
- [07:24] little counterintuitive but that is the
- [07:26] syntax that you need to use. Now x is
- [07:30] not equal to y. One is 10, one is three.
- [07:32] So of course that's going to be false.
- [07:34] But if we said x is equal to x then this
- [07:37] will evaluate to true. The last one that
- [07:40] you need to know and this is the
- [07:42] opposite of equal to is not equal to. So
- [07:45] if we say x is not equal to y, that's an
- [07:49] exclamation point with an equal sign. If
- [07:51] we say x is not equal to y, we're
- [07:53] checking are they not equal? And that is
- [07:56] true. They're not equal. And so these
- [07:58] are comparison operators that are very
- [08:00] commonly used. You'll use these so often
- [08:03] they'll just become second nature. And
- [08:04] the last one that we're going to take a
- [08:05] look at is logical
- [08:08] operators. Now logical operators uh you
- [08:11] know aside from you know the basics.
- [08:14] Logical operators are used all the time
- [08:16] for everything. They are here to help
- [08:19] determine and evaluate expressions to
- [08:21] determine if they are true or if they
- [08:23] are false or if multiple conditions are
- [08:25] true or false. So right up here let's
- [08:28] get this uh x is greater than y. We
- [08:31] know that that is true, right? We know
- [08:35] this is true. But what if I add I want
- [08:38] that to be true. And this is where the
- [08:40] logical operator comes in. So we want x
- [08:43] and y that way evaluates to true. But we
- [08:45] also want x to be equal to x. So we're
- [08:49] going to put this right here. So now
- [08:52] we're evaluating two separate
- [08:54] conditions. And this one right here,
- [08:57] this amperand I believe is what it's
- [08:58] called, which is a shift uh let's see,
- [09:01] seven on my keyboard. This amperand
- [09:04] means that both this and this condition
- [09:07] need to be met in order for it to
- [09:09] evaluate to true. Let's go ahead and run
- [09:11] this. So since both of these conditions
- [09:14] is true, this is great. X is greater
- [09:16] than Y and X is equal to X, this
- [09:18] evaluates to true. But let's change
- [09:21] this. We're going to change it to Y. We
- [09:24] know this is false. So this is true but
- [09:27] this is false. So are they both true? So
- [09:29] it needs this and this need to be true.
- [09:33] Since one of them is false, we will get
- [09:35] an output of false. And so this is what
- [09:37] a logical operator is. Now we're going
- [09:40] to take take this exact same thing and
- [09:43] we're going to bring it down here and
- [09:44] we're going to change this into a bar.
- [09:47] and I call it a bar, but it's a shift
- [09:49] and it's right above my enter key on my
- [09:51] keyboard, right next to the backslash.
- [09:53] Um, but this right here means or. So,
- [09:55] this is and and this is or. These are
- [09:58] the ones you're going to use 99% of the
- [10:01] time. So, you're going to say is this
- [10:03] condition true or is this condition
- [10:06] true? If either one of these conditions
- [10:09] are true, it will be true down here.
- [10:11] They don't both have to be true. So now
- [10:14] if we run this, we're going to get true.
- [10:17] X is greater than Y. This evaluates to
- [10:20] true or this which evaluates to false.
- [10:24] Since just one of them is true, then the
- [10:26] entire expression evaluates to true.
- [10:29] There is technically one more logical
- [10:30] operator and I'm going to be honest I I
- [10:33] don't think I ever use this one. Um or
- [10:35] if I do, it's a very specific use cases.
- [10:38] This is the not operator. This is going
- [10:41] to say this. So let's run this. This is
- [10:44] false, but we're going to run this with
- [10:47] the not operator and it's going to
- [10:49] change it to true. So it basically
- [10:50] reverses the boolean value that is in
- [10:53] the output. If it's true, it changes it
- [10:54] to false. If it's false, it changes it
- [10:56] to true. It just flips the value. That's
- [10:58] all this operator does. I think I've
- [11:00] used this a few times in very specific
- [11:02] use cases, but 99.9% of the time, I'm
- [11:06] using the and and the or logical
- [11:08] operators. Those are the ones that are
- [11:09] the most common to use. So, this is the
- [11:11] basics of using operators. Now, in the
- [11:13] next lesson, we're going to start
- [11:15] working with our data set, how we can
- [11:17] pull it in, how we can put it into a
- [11:18] data frame, how we can write files and
- [11:21] create files as well. If you haven't
- [11:23] already, be sure to check out my full R
- [11:24] for data analytics course on Analyst
- [11:26] Builder. I'll leave a link in the
- [11:28] description and a coupon code if you
- [11:30] would like to take that course. Thank
- [11:32] you guys so much for watching and I will
