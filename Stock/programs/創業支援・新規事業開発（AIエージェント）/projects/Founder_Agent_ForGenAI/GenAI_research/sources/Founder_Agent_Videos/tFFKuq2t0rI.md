- [00:00] Today we're going to be talking about
- [00:01] how you can build anything with B 44 and
- [00:03] NAN AI agents. If you've never heard of
- [00:06] B 44, it allows you to spin up really
- [00:08] beautiful looking web apps with just
- [00:10] your words. So it's almost like you're
- [00:11] just having a conversation with a
- [00:13] software engineer. They've also got some
- [00:14] native integrations in there like
- [00:16] OpenAI, text to image, monday.com,
- [00:18] Slack, Google Places, and a few others.
- [00:20] But it lacks some of those really custom
- [00:22] integrations and workflows that you can
- [00:23] build with NAND. So when we combine base
- [00:25] 44 with nitn we're then able to have our
- [00:28] AI agents power the back end of our
- [00:30] entire web app. It gets really really
- [00:32] powerful and the possibilities are truly
- [00:33] endless. So what we're going to be doing
- [00:35] today is a live build of an AI powered
- [00:37] lead magnet system. If you want to
- [00:39] actually go ahead and follow along with
- [00:40] this video, I'm going to do everything
- [00:41] like I said live in front of you guys
- [00:43] and I'll have all the prompts and
- [00:45] resources that you'll need to follow
- [00:46] along in my free school community. The
- [00:48] link for that is down in the
- [00:49] description. But anyways, what we're
- [00:50] building today is a lead magnet system.
- [00:52] And so let's say you are an AI
- [00:54] consultant and you're trying to get some
- [00:55] clients. We're going to create a front
- [00:57] end with base 44. And this front end is
- [00:59] going to allow the client to put in
- [01:01] their name, their email, and describe a
- [01:03] problem they're having. The idea here is
- [01:04] that you're going to be able to capture
- [01:05] them in and provide some free value. So
- [01:07] say, "Hey, go to this website, put in
- [01:08] your information, and then I'll give you
- [01:10] a free report, a free AI implementation
- [01:12] audit." And so the data that the client
- [01:14] enters into our base 44 app is going to
- [01:16] be sent to an NIDAN AI agent that's
- [01:18] going to be trained on how to conduct an
- [01:20] AI implementation roadmap. And then from
- [01:23] NAND, it'll get sent straight to that
- [01:24] client's inbox and it's going to be
- [01:26] really professional looking. And then at
- [01:27] the bottom of that email, it's going to
- [01:28] say, "Hey, if you want more, book in a
- [01:30] call and let's talk." So this is
- [01:32] actually a system that I would spin up
- [01:33] for myself if I didn't have a lot of
- [01:34] inbound coming from YouTube. But this
- [01:36] would be a great way to add some
- [01:38] credibility to yourself and give out
- [01:39] some free value. So then even if a
- [01:41] client doesn't initially decide to work
- [01:42] with you, they still have you in your
- [01:44] mind as like a good person. Anyways,
- [01:46] don't want to waste any time. So let's
- [01:47] hop right into B 44 and start building
- [01:50] our front end. All right, so here we are
- [01:51] in Base 44. If you guys want to check it
- [01:53] out, there'll be a link down in the
- [01:54] description you can use to sign up.
- [01:55] We've got the interface right here where
- [01:57] it says, "What would you like to build
- [01:58] today?" And all we have to do is
- [01:59] describe the app that we want to create.
- [02:01] You can see up top we have app templates
- [02:03] that you can choose from if you want to
- [02:04] start with one, just get some
- [02:05] inspiration and then customize it
- [02:07] further. And Base 44 was actually
- [02:09] recently acquired by Wix. And Wix has
- [02:11] been around for a long time and it's
- [02:12] been known for being able to spin up
- [02:15] landing pages and websites really
- [02:16] easily. And if you've ever vibecoded
- [02:18] with some of the other apps out there
- [02:19] that do something like this, you may
- [02:21] notice that sometimes they look very
- [02:23] vibecoded or you can tell they were
- [02:24] built with AI. So what I'm going to do
- [02:26] today is make sure that our app does not
- [02:27] look like it was vibecoded. You can also
- [02:29] see we have some integrations here. So
- [02:31] we have native integrations with openAI
- [02:32] text to image e Toro, Gemini, Reend, 11
- [02:36] Labs, Claude, Twilio. So like I said,
- [02:38] there are some native integrations
- [02:39] within Bass itself. But where the power
- [02:42] really comes in is when we connect it to
- [02:44] any and we can do actually anything. You
- [02:46] also see that you have styling
- [02:47] instructions right here. So, if you
- [02:48] wanted to choose like a neo brutalism
- [02:50] type of style or neomorphism or glass
- [02:52] morphism, you could just click add style
- [02:54] instructions and now you already have
- [02:56] these specs in here so that the web app
- [02:58] is spun up with that type of style. But
- [03:01] we're going to start and just do this
- [03:02] pretty raw. I'm not going to use a style
- [03:03] guide. We're just going to describe what
- [03:05] we want and then I'm going to show you
- [03:06] guys how we can customize it to make it
- [03:08] look really cool. So, I'm just going to
- [03:09] go ahead and say I need a
- [03:11] professionallook landing page for my AI
- [03:13] consulting company, AI Automation
- [03:15] Society. I want it to say up top AI
- [03:18] automation society AI consulting get
- [03:21] your free AI implementation roadmap and
- [03:25] then the main section of this landing
- [03:27] page will be where they fill in some
- [03:29] information. So we'll want to collect
- [03:31] their first and last name, their email
- [03:33] address, and then a larger text box for
- [03:36] entering in a business process or a
- [03:38] problem they're having and they would
- [03:39] like to figure out how to automate it or
- [03:41] how to implement AI into it. And then
- [03:43] there'll be a button at the bottom that
- [03:44] says get your free AI implementation
- [03:46] guide. And they'll click on that to
- [03:48] submit their information. After they
- [03:50] submit, it should just basically take
- [03:51] them to a different page that says your
- [03:53] information has been received. Expect
- [03:55] your guide in your inbox in 3 to 5
- [03:57] minutes. The main color for our brand is
- [03:59] light blue. Okay. So that is my very
- [04:01] very brief prompt that we put in here.
- [04:03] One tip that you could do is you could
- [04:05] first put this into something like
- [04:06] Claude and say, "Hey, can you help me
- [04:08] create a project requirement document
- [04:10] for a website build?" and then it would
- [04:11] give you a more detailed one. But I'm
- [04:13] just going to start with this for now.
- [04:14] We're going to send this off. And what's
- [04:16] happening now is on the right hand side,
- [04:17] you can see it's creating our app. And
- [04:19] so this is where we're going to see a
- [04:20] preview of our web app. And on the lefth
- [04:22] hand side, we have just like a
- [04:23] conversation thread. So it'll you can
- [04:25] see here it's telling us what it's
- [04:26] doing. And this is where we can talk
- [04:28] back and forth and make sure that our
- [04:29] website is turning out how we want it.
- [04:31] So I'll check back in with you guys in
- [04:32] just a sec here when we get our first
- [04:34] iteration of our site. All right. So we
- [04:36] just got back our first iteration. We
- [04:38] have AI consulting excellence, AI
- [04:40] automation society, AI consulting.
- [04:41] That's a lot of AI. Get your free AI
- [04:44] implementation road map. Okay, nice. You
- [04:46] can see the background is kind of like a
- [04:48] light blue and white gradient almost.
- [04:50] We've got custom strategy, fast
- [04:52] delivery, expert guidance. And then down
- [04:54] here, you can see we have start your AI
- [04:56] journey today, first name, last name,
- [04:58] email address, and then describe
- [05:00] business process. We've also got get
- [05:02] your free AI implementation guide. Cool.
- [05:04] So, this is a great place to start. It's
- [05:06] it's really nice. It's very clean, but
- [05:08] you can definitely tell that this was
- [05:10] vibecoded with AI. So, we want to change
- [05:12] up a few of these things and make it
- [05:13] look more professional. So, what I'm
- [05:14] going to show you guys is this cool site
- [05:16] called 21st.dev, and it has a ton of
- [05:18] cool website elements that we can
- [05:20] basically just copy the code to and put
- [05:23] it into our app in B4 and it will just
- [05:26] make the changes. Okay, so here's a cool
- [05:28] one I found. We've got these display
- [05:29] cards where when you hover over them,
- [05:31] they sort of pop up. And I was thinking
- [05:33] that this could look really cool as
- [05:34] these three cards instead of them being
- [05:36] spread out like that. So all I'm going
- [05:38] to do is go into here and I'm going to
- [05:40] click on copy prompt in the top right.
- [05:42] You can see that it lets you choose your
- [05:43] prompt for bolt claw code cursor lovable
- [05:46] replet and vo. So we're just going to go
- [05:48] with lovable for now. And we're just
- [05:49] going to copy this prompt. Now back in
- [05:51] base 44 I'm going to click on this
- [05:52] button down here that says visual edit.
- [05:54] And I'm basically going to select all
- [05:56] three of these div containers. So these
- [05:57] three cards. And I'm just going to say
- [05:59] apply this effect to the selected div of
- [06:02] the three cards. Okay. So you can see I
- [06:04] pasted in that code from 21st.dev. And
- [06:07] now base 44 is just going to think about
- [06:09] how to do it. It's going to execute that
- [06:11] code. And then we should see in this
- [06:13] preview section that we have that
- [06:15] integrated. So I'll check back in when
- [06:17] we get that. Okay. So we just got that
- [06:19] changed. But you can see there's like a
- [06:20] duplicate card in front of each of
- [06:22] these. So I'm just going to ask it to
- [06:24] get rid of that. And there you go. I
- [06:26] literally just said there's a weird
- [06:27] blank card in front of the benefit
- [06:28] cards. Please remove that. And now we
- [06:30] have these three that pop up. It looks
- [06:32] really nice. We might just want to add a
- [06:34] little bit of spacing right here after
- [06:35] these cards and before the text box
- [06:37] starts. All right, cool. So, I just
- [06:38] said, "Please add some space between the
- [06:40] benefit cards and the text boxes." And
- [06:41] you can see it added space and it still
- [06:43] kept this effect. So, that's looking
- [06:44] really nice. So, what you guys will
- [06:46] notice is it's never going to be
- [06:47] perfect. No matter which of these AI
- [06:49] coding assistants you use, it's never
- [06:50] going to be perfect. You just have to
- [06:52] figure out how to work with it to go
- [06:53] back and forth a little bit. And now you
- [06:55] can see in a matter of two minutes I
- [06:57] have this cool effect on my website. All
- [06:59] right. So now I found this little
- [07:01] animation that can come behind our main
- [07:04] text. So I'm just going to copy this
- [07:06] prompt once again. And I'm going to come
- [07:08] into base 44. And I probably want this
- [07:10] animation to be up near the top. And
- [07:13] usually they call this hero text. So
- [07:14] what I'm going to do is just say to add
- [07:16] this effect behind the hero text. Okay.
- [07:19] So it's applying those actions right
- [07:20] now. Let's see how it turned out. Okay,
- [07:22] cool. So, it came through and you can
- [07:24] see now we have that little thing up
- [07:25] top. Although, I don't like how it just
- [07:27] cuts off here so abruptly. So, I'm going
- [07:29] to have it blend it all back in
- [07:30] together. And it's probably because I
- [07:32] specified the hero text. But one thing
- [07:34] you will notice is the colors are still
- [07:35] consistent with the rest of our page.
- [07:38] All right. So, there we go. It just
- [07:40] basically blended that into the whole
- [07:41] background. And I think that looks a lot
- [07:43] better than what it previously was. We
- [07:45] have our effect here. We've got our
- [07:46] background that when you basically load
- [07:48] in the page, that's when it sort of like
- [07:50] has that animation where it falls down
- [07:52] and and and floats down. So, I think you
- [07:54] could argue that maybe I'm going a
- [07:56] little too overboard with 21st.dev. The
- [07:58] point being, I want to show you guys how
- [08:00] quickly you can spin up these landing
- [08:01] pages and add some really custom effects
- [08:04] so it doesn't look like it was just an
- [08:05] AI built website. And of course, you can
- [08:08] also make changes without even using the
- [08:10] AI chat. So, like let's say you wanted
- [08:12] to change the font of this text right
- [08:14] here. I could select it and I could just
- [08:16] basically come here and choose to change
- [08:18] the font right here. We have all these
- [08:19] different options. I could underline it
- [08:21] if I wanted. I could cross it through. I
- [08:23] could also change the color. So instead
- [08:24] of this gray, I could make it white. But
- [08:26] that looks horrible because then you
- [08:27] can't see it. But anyways, the point
- [08:28] being you can use this visual edit and
- [08:30] you can select exactly what you want to
- [08:32] change. All right. So the last thing I'm
- [08:33] going to add is this little border thing
- [08:35] where you can see when my mouse is near
- [08:37] the border, it's going to sort of have
- [08:39] this little light. What you can see here
- [08:41] is in the example, this is rainbow. And
- [08:42] I'm curious to see if we put a border
- [08:44] around this div container here if it's
- [08:46] going to make it rainbow or if it'll
- [08:47] make it blue to match the theme of our
- [08:49] site already. So I clicked on visual
- [08:51] edit. I'm going to select this container
- [08:53] and just say to add this effect to the
- [08:56] selected div. Okay. So it just made
- [08:58] those changes. Let's see. So we do have
- [09:00] this glowing effect, but it's like
- [09:01] really sharp. So I think it took it a
- [09:03] little bit too literally when I selected
- [09:05] that container. All right. Perfect. So
- [09:07] now you can see it's a much softer blue
- [09:09] glow, which it did do the blue color,
- [09:11] but now it's actually applied to the
- [09:13] card. And what happened was I basically
- [09:15] said to apply the effect. I then said it
- [09:16] was too sharp and then it came back and
- [09:18] then it was too light. So I said now I
- [09:20] can hardly see it. Also, don't highlight
- [09:22] the fact that I used the wrong effect
- [09:23] here. Super embarrassing. But anyways,
- [09:25] this was all spun up in about 10 minutes
- [09:27] of work. And we've added some pretty
- [09:28] cool custom animations and effects. I'm
- [09:30] not saying I'm a master of design.
- [09:31] There's a lot here that I would want to
- [09:33] change, but once again, the point is
- [09:34] this has been 10 minutes of work. Now,
- [09:36] let's say we are a lead and we fill out
- [09:38] this information, right? We have name,
- [09:40] we have email address, and then the
- [09:41] problem. And what they'll do is they'll
- [09:42] click get your free AI implementation
- [09:44] guide. It now opens up this screen that
- [09:46] says, "Your information has been
- [09:47] received. Expect your guide in your
- [09:49] inbox in 3 to 5 minutes." It says, "Our
- [09:51] AI specialists are going to review.
- [09:53] We're going to create a custom road map
- [09:54] and you'll receive that via email." And
- [09:56] then you can also click to go back to
- [09:58] the homepage. But the issue is when we
- [10:00] just submitted that information, it
- [10:01] actually didn't go anywhere. So we need
- [10:04] to give base 44 our end web hook and
- [10:07] then our end workflow can actually
- [10:09] receive that information. So let's real
- [10:11] quick hop into a new workflow in edit.
- [10:13] You can see we have nothing here. What
- [10:14] I'm going to do is we're going to add a
- [10:16] web hook which is going to start the
- [10:17] workflow. A web hook is basically just
- [10:19] an ear that's always actively listening.
- [10:22] And so whenever sound comes in, it
- [10:24] basically just grabs it and then it can
- [10:25] do something with it. So what we have in
- [10:27] our web hook is a test URL. We're going
- [10:29] to grab this test URL. And actually
- [10:31] before we grab it, I'm just going to
- [10:32] change the method to post. I'm not going
- [10:34] to dive into why we're doing that right
- [10:35] now. Essentially, it's so that B 44 can
- [10:38] post or send data to this web hook. So
- [10:40] it's a post method. I'm going to click
- [10:42] on this to copy it. And now back in base
- [10:45] 44, I just need to say when a user
- [10:48] clicks on the get your free AI
- [10:49] implementation guide button, send the
- [10:52] data to this web hook as a post request.
- [10:55] And so then now I will paste in my web
- [10:57] hook. And then I'm going to add one more
- [10:58] thing. send over the following four
- [11:00] fields in the body of the post request.
- [11:02] First name, last name, email address,
- [11:06] and prompt. Okay, so we're going to
- [11:08] shoot that off. And basically what it's
- [11:10] going to do is it's going to change the
- [11:12] code so that when someone clicks on this
- [11:14] button, we're going to get all of this
- [11:15] data that the user input into our end
- [11:18] workflow. And then that's where we can
- [11:19] set up an agent on the back end to
- [11:21] create that AI implementation guide.
- [11:24] Okay, so it claims that it has done
- [11:25] that. I'm going to go into end and we're
- [11:27] just going to real quick hit execute
- [11:29] workflow which means that this web hook
- [11:31] is now listening. When you make it an
- [11:33] active workflow it will always be
- [11:34] listening but right now we're just in
- [11:35] test mode so I have to make it listen
- [11:37] manually but you can see it says waiting
- [11:39] for you to call the test URL. So if I go
- [11:41] back in here and I click this button
- [11:43] this should send the data to end because
- [11:45] we configured it to. And if we go back
- [11:47] into Nitn, we can now see that we did
- [11:49] capture this data. So that's perfect. We
- [11:50] know it's working. And now we can see we
- [11:52] got first name, last name, email, and we
- [11:55] got the prompt, which is what I entered.
- [11:57] So this is the problem that the user is
- [11:58] having. And this is what we need to use
- [12:00] to give them their road map. So what's
- [12:02] next is real quick, I'm going to pin
- [12:04] this data so we don't have to keep
- [12:05] sending data from base 44 to end. We can
- [12:07] just play with it here. And I'm going to
- [12:09] create two separate AI agents. The first
- [12:11] one is going to take that incoming
- [12:12] prompt, which is very minimal, and going
- [12:14] to create a full AI implementation road
- [12:16] map. And then the second one is going to
- [12:19] style it up in HTML and send it to them
- [12:21] via email. So the first one we're going
- [12:23] to do is an AI agent. This is going to
- [12:25] be our AI consultant. We have to give it
- [12:27] access to a brain, so a chat model. So
- [12:29] I'm going to click on the chat model
- [12:31] button and I'm going to go ahead and
- [12:32] grab an open router chat model. Now if
- [12:34] you've never used open router before,
- [12:35] you just need to go to open router.ai,
- [12:37] make an account. In the top right,
- [12:39] you'll go to keys and then just create
- [12:40] an API key. It will give you this long
- [12:43] string of numbers and letters and all
- [12:44] you need to do is create a new
- [12:46] credential and put that in right there.
- [12:47] And now you'll have access to tons and
- [12:49] tons of different AI chat models. Just
- [12:51] make sure you have billing information
- [12:52] in your open router account. And what
- [12:54] I'm going to do for our AI consultant is
- [12:56] I'm going to use OpenAI 03 because it's
- [12:58] a reasoning model and it's going to be
- [12:59] good for us to have lots of reasoning
- [13:01] going through this AI consultant. I'm
- [13:03] also going to open this up and we're
- [13:05] going to configure a few things. The
- [13:06] first one is what do we want the agent
- [13:08] to read? And what we wanted to read is
- [13:10] in the body request, we wanted to read
- [13:12] the prompt. So this is whatever the user
- [13:13] typed in in this big text box right
- [13:17] here. So we were able to drag in from
- [13:19] the left to the right the prompt. And
- [13:21] now the AI agent's looking at that. The
- [13:23] next thing we need to do is give it a
- [13:24] system prompt, which is basically
- [13:25] telling it its instructions. And I'm
- [13:27] just going to paste in this system
- [13:28] prompt, which is basically telling it
- [13:29] that it's an expert consultant, how to
- [13:31] think about what to do, what it should
- [13:33] break down, inefficiencies, design the
- [13:35] road map, frame ROI clearly, all this
- [13:37] kind of stuff. And then at the end it
- [13:39] needs to say close by saying if you'd
- [13:41] like to take the next step book a
- [13:42] discovery call with me here. And then it
- [13:44] will actually attach that discovery call
- [13:46] link in the full email. And if you want
- [13:47] to be able to copy this prompt it will
- [13:49] be in my free school community like I
- [13:50] said with all the other resources that
- [13:52] you need to follow along with this
- [13:53] build. So now what I'm going to do is
- [13:55] I'm going to go ahead and click execute
- [13:56] step which is running the agent. So the
- [13:58] agent has now read the web hook request.
- [14:01] It's now using 03 and it's going to
- [14:03] output some information back to us and
- [14:05] it's going to be a full implementation
- [14:08] guide. All right, so that just finished
- [14:09] up. Let me click into it and make sure
- [14:11] we do have our guide. So we've got
- [14:12] diagnosis of the problem and you can see
- [14:15] this is pretty lengthy and it ends with
- [14:16] our discovery call. So that's perfect.
- [14:18] I'm going to go ahead and pin this data
- [14:19] so we don't have to run that agent
- [14:20] again. And we're going to make the next
- [14:22] one which is going to style it up in
- [14:24] HTML. So once again, we're going to add
- [14:26] an AI agent. We're going to have it read
- [14:29] the diagnosis. So, I'm going to change
- [14:30] this to define below, and we're going to
- [14:32] drag in the output of the first agent
- [14:34] right here. That's what the stylist
- [14:36] agent is going to read. I have to go
- [14:37] ahead and give the style agent a style
- [14:39] guide of how to write HTML. So, I'm
- [14:41] going to go ahead and paste that in
- [14:42] here. As you can see, if you guys want
- [14:44] to access this, it'll be in my free
- [14:46] school community with all the other
- [14:47] resources. And then what I want to do is
- [14:49] actually give this agent a different
- [14:50] chat model. So, I'm going to once again
- [14:52] use open router, but instead of using
- [14:53] 03, I'm going to grab a sonnet model.
- [14:56] We're going to go with the new Sonnet
- [14:58] 4.5 model because I really like the way
- [15:00] that it writes and it's going to be good
- [15:02] at generating HTML. So, I'm going to go
- [15:04] ahead and click the play above the
- [15:05] agent. So, it's going to start to run.
- [15:07] It's right now looking at the output of
- [15:09] the consultant agent and it's going to
- [15:10] turn that into HTML style for us. And
- [15:13] so, one other thing that I wanted to
- [15:14] call out, this flow doesn't make us send
- [15:17] any data back to B 44. If you wanted to
- [15:20] do that, it would be super simple. You'd
- [15:22] come into your web hook. You would
- [15:23] basically right here it's kind of grayed
- [15:24] out but it says respond immediately.
- [15:26] Instead of immediately you would change
- [15:28] it to say respond using web hook node or
- [15:31] using respond to web hook node. And that
- [15:33] means that we could have base 44 send
- [15:35] data to end it in. We could have base 44
- [15:37] wait until we send something back. So if
- [15:39] we wanted to actually have the the
- [15:41] person get their report right here in
- [15:42] this interface, we could have it send
- [15:44] back and then the the person could just
- [15:45] view it right here. That's not what
- [15:47] we're doing in today's example, but if
- [15:49] you wanted to, it'd be super easy. you
- [15:50] would just have to tell B 44 to wait for
- [15:52] Naden's response and then display it
- [15:54] when it gets it back. But anyways, the
- [15:56] style agent is now done. So, I'm going
- [15:58] to go ahead and real quick pin this data
- [16:00] so we don't lose it. And you can see we
- [16:01] have, you know, doc type HTML. We have
- [16:03] all of this with different colors and
- [16:05] padding and margin and texts. So, what
- [16:07] we need to do is real quick add a Gmail
- [16:09] node so we can actually send it over as
- [16:12] an email and see what it looks like in
- [16:13] HTML. So, we're always going to be
- [16:15] sending the data to whoever entered in
- [16:17] their information. So, we can grab the
- [16:19] email from the web hook and put that
- [16:21] right there. For the subject, I just
- [16:23] went ahead and put your free AI
- [16:24] implementation guide by AI Automation
- [16:26] Society. We're leaving the email type as
- [16:28] HTML, not text because we formatted it
- [16:30] as HTML. And then the body of the email,
- [16:33] I'm just going to drag in that output of
- [16:34] the style agent. And then finally, I
- [16:36] just want to change the append
- [16:38] attribution, toggle that off. So then
- [16:40] the bottom of the email doesn't say that
- [16:42] this was sent by NadN. So now that
- [16:43] that's filled out, I can go ahead and
- [16:45] execute step and it's going to send that
- [16:46] email as HTML. And let's go take a look
- [16:49] and see how it turned out. Okay, there
- [16:50] we go. So we have your free AI
- [16:52] invitation guide, email automation
- [16:53] strategy report, intelligent email
- [16:55] processing and response system. We start
- [16:57] off with the problem diagnosis. It's a
- [16:59] very manual workflow with five
- [17:00] repetitive steps. Reading each email,
- [17:03] determining the intent, locating
- [17:04] relevant background documents, composing
- [17:07] or copy paste response, and then file
- [17:09] email for future reference. It analyzes
- [17:11] the inefficiency. So, it's calling out a
- [17:13] painoint, which is 3 to 10 minutes per
- [17:14] message, which could equal 2 to 8 hours
- [17:16] per week if there's 50 emails, lots of
- [17:18] context switching, 100% true,
- [17:20] inconsistent quality, and knowledge
- [17:22] fragmentation. We then move into the
- [17:24] road map. So, we start with phase A,
- [17:25] which is a quick win or MVP in 1 to two
- [17:27] days. We highlight how we'd actually do
- [17:29] that. So, we'd start with a trigger.
- [17:31] We'd have LLM intent classification.
- [17:33] We'd have auto labeling, and then
- [17:34] template-based drafting. And an expected
- [17:36] result would be 60 to 70% of emails
- [17:38] handled instantly without document
- [17:40] search required. Then phase B, we kind
- [17:43] of move up to a 2 to four-week solution.
- [17:45] Now we have a central knowledge base
- [17:47] with all of the documents and stuff that
- [17:48] we need. We have a unified email
- [17:50] processor. We have a feedback loop and a
- [17:53] dashboard. And then we move on to phase
- [17:55] C, which is long-term improvement. We've
- [17:57] got private LLM hosting, continuous
- [17:59] learning, multi- channelannel expansion,
- [18:00] CRM integration, and compliance layer.
- [18:03] And this is really cool. It then goes on
- [18:04] to talk about the return on investment.
- [18:06] So, we have a daily time spend. We have
- [18:08] monthly cost as you can see. And then we
- [18:10] have monthly savings, which can get up
- [18:12] to $3,000. We have infrastructure cost.
- [18:15] And we have net monthly benefit. Now,
- [18:17] one thing here is take this with a grain
- [18:18] of salt because our consultant agent
- [18:20] made this data. And the consultant agent
- [18:22] doesn't yet know how we would charge or,
- [18:24] you know, what we would price the
- [18:25] solution at. So, this kind of stuff,
- [18:27] these figures are a little bit made up.
- [18:28] In order to really do an ROI analysis,
- [18:30] you'd need to prompt for more
- [18:32] information about how much manual time
- [18:33] it's really taking. But with the very
- [18:35] very limited and minimal prompt that
- [18:38] kicked off this whole flow, this isn't
- [18:39] too bad. And it shows how our agents
- [18:41] could lay this in a table format to make
- [18:42] this really digestible for the potential
- [18:45] client. It ends the bottom off with
- [18:46] implementation steps. We've got five
- [18:48] steps right here. And then we have the
- [18:50] call to action to book our discovery
- [18:52] call, which takes us to the Calendarly
- [18:54] link to book in a call if this ever
- [18:56] loads up. There it is, as you can see.
- [18:58] So, we were given a really, really tiny
- [19:00] bit of information about a person and we
- [19:02] were able to directly to their inbox
- [19:03] give them a lot of free value and
- [19:06] hopefully convince them to book in a
- [19:08] full call. So, now that we have this
- [19:10] workflow set up, what I'm going to do is
- [19:11] unpin all of this data and hit save. And
- [19:14] now I'm going to activate this workflow.
- [19:16] So, now it is turned on and it says you
- [19:19] now make calls to your production URL.
- [19:21] So, what we have to do is go back into
- [19:23] our web hook and we have to switch this
- [19:25] to production and grab this production
- [19:27] URL. Now, keep in mind it's always going
- [19:30] to by default when you open up this web
- [19:31] hook node, it's always going to look
- [19:33] like it's on the test. But don't worry
- [19:34] about that. As long as you give your
- [19:37] front end base 44, as long as we give it
- [19:39] this production URL, it will call it.
- [19:42] And I'll show you guys what I mean by
- [19:43] that right now. This is all saved. I'm
- [19:45] going to go back into our website and
- [19:47] I'm going to say please update the web
- [19:48] hook to this following web hook.
- [19:51] Everything else can be the same. So
- [19:52] hopefully it understands what I mean by
- [19:54] that. I'm going to shoot that off and it
- [19:55] should be basically updating this button
- [19:57] to go to this new web hook address
- [19:59] rather than the old one that we gave it.
- [20:01] So it says that it updated the web hook
- [20:03] to the new endpoint. We see that our
- [20:05] workflow is active. And what I'm going
- [20:06] to do now is just make another request
- [20:08] and we'll see if it's actually capturing
- [20:09] it or not. Okay, so I filled in some
- [20:11] information. We're going to go ahead and
- [20:12] submit that. We can see your information
- [20:14] has been received. I'm going to go to
- [20:16] our edit in workflow and I'm going to
- [20:18] click on executions and we should see
- [20:20] nice it is running. So this is going to
- [20:23] run for I don't know maybe a minute or
- [20:24] so and once that's finished up we'll see
- [20:26] that it's done and then we'll go take a
- [20:28] look at our email that we should have
- [20:30] gotten from this landing page. Also, one
- [20:33] quick thing that I felt obligated to
- [20:34] make sure you were all aware of. If you
- [20:36] are doing this and you're giving out
- [20:37] your link to random people, when they
- [20:40] submit a request on your site and your
- [20:42] web hook captures it, this is going to
- [20:43] be using your API credits. So if someone
- [20:46] decides that they want to submit a,000
- [20:47] requests on your website, you would be
- [20:49] the one paying for those thousand
- [20:50] requests when it comes to running those
- [20:52] AI models in NIDN. So just wanted to
- [20:54] make sure you guys were all aware of
- [20:55] that and just something to keep in mind.
- [20:57] All right, so you can see that this just
- [20:58] finished up. I just wanted to real quick
- [21:00] prove to you guys that this is the one
- [21:01] that we just submitted. As you can see,
- [21:03] this came from Nate. Nate
- [21:05] Nateherk@gmail.com. And this was exactly
- [21:07] what I typed in there. And the email has
- [21:09] been sent. So let's hop over and see
- [21:11] what it looks like. Okay, so we got your
- [21:13] free AI implantation guide once again.
- [21:15] Meeting prep, automation, proposal, and
- [21:17] road map. Notice that the HTML style is
- [21:19] consistent with the last one. So we
- [21:21] always have this basically being the
- [21:23] format that matches our brand. We have
- [21:25] transform 20 minutes of manual research
- [21:27] into automated intelligence. We start
- [21:28] off again by diagnosing the problem. So
- [21:30] 20 minutes per meeting manually. We're
- [21:32] pulling the information from LinkedIn
- [21:34] and Google. We're hunting through the
- [21:35] CRM system for deal history and
- [21:37] transactions and we're creating talking
- [21:39] points and formulating relevant
- [21:41] questions. The time impact is at five
- [21:43] meetings a day. This represents almost 2
- [21:45] hours lost daily which could be 8 hours
- [21:47] a week. We then once again highlight
- [21:49] more pain. Why is this current process
- [21:51] inefficient? And then we move into our
- [21:53] three-phased automation road map. We
- [21:55] start with a quick win MVP which is 1
- [21:57] hour before every meeting we should
- [21:59] receive a single DM which is a prep
- [22:01] sheet for that meeting. This is a really
- [22:03] cool table. We've have the component, we
- [22:04] have the tech, and then we have the
- [22:06] function. So it breaks down the trigger,
- [22:08] the data enrichment with Apollo or
- [22:10] people data labs, the CRM integration,
- [22:12] the AI summary, the news content, and
- [22:14] then the delivery. We also move into our
- [22:16] scalable solution once again, which is
- [22:18] one to two weeks. We have things like a
- [22:20] cron job, result caching, cost
- [22:21] optimization, and a dashboard. And then
- [22:24] when we move into our long-term
- [22:25] enhancements, we have things like our
- [22:27] real-time meeting assistant, automating
- [22:28] follow-ups, knowledgebased gra, and
- [22:30] analytics layer. And keep in mind what
- [22:32] you guys would do here is you would
- [22:34] prompt your AI consultant to maybe even
- [22:36] dig into your database so that it knows
- [22:38] a lot about you and your business and
- [22:39] how you like to do business so that your
- [22:42] actual implementation guides are more
- [22:44] accurate and specific to you. Down here
- [22:46] once again we have estimated ROI. We can
- [22:48] see that you would get you know payback
- [22:49] within 3 days. You would make around
- [22:51] 2500 a month off of this system in ROI
- [22:54] that is and you would save about 36
- [22:57] hours a month. Of course, it's going to
- [22:58] list out some next steps and then the
- [23:01] nice call to action here. Ready to
- [23:02] reclaim eight plus hours per week and
- [23:04] never walk into an unprepared meeting
- [23:06] again? Well, book in a discovery call
- [23:08] right here. So, that is the example of
- [23:10] what we have. And you can see in total
- [23:13] that took me like maybe 30 minutes if
- [23:15] that to build a front-end landing page
- [23:17] like this that's very professional
- [23:19] looking. This took less than 10 minutes.
- [23:21] And just imagine where I could get if I
- [23:22] spent another hour on it. And then we
- [23:24] built a back-end automation that only
- [23:26] utilizes two agents, one to do the
- [23:28] consulting and one to do the style. And
- [23:30] once again, this took me less than 10
- [23:31] minutes. So all you would need to do is
- [23:33] create your own landing page and then
- [23:35] create your own AI consultant. And then
- [23:37] you can start throwing this out there as
- [23:39] a value ad lead magnet. And back in base
- [23:42] 44, what you see in the bottom left is
- [23:45] ready for a custom domain, just go ahead
- [23:46] and connect one. So if I wanted to
- [23:48] connect one, all I'd have to do is buy a
- [23:50] new domain or connect it here. So any
- [23:53] single domain you have, you can make it
- [23:55] host your base 44 web app. You also can
- [23:58] see analytics, you can have users, you
- [24:00] can add security, you've got logs, all
- [24:02] this kind of stuff that you can add. So
- [24:04] you can manage your full website and of
- [24:06] course send all of your data to a
- [24:07] backend automation like Naden. So the
- [24:09] way that this works is through credits.
- [24:11] And you can see you can start for 20
- [24:12] bucks a month and you can get 100
- [24:14] monthly credits. And just for reference,
- [24:15] you're getting charged a credit every
- [24:17] time you basically send it a message. So
- [24:19] the more detailed you are, the better.
- [24:21] But you can see in just this web app, I
- [24:23] probably only used 10 credits. There's a
- [24:25] link down in the description if you want
- [24:26] to check out B4 for yourself. So go
- [24:28] ahead and get over there. So if you guys
- [24:30] want to spin up a lead magnet like this
- [24:32] and you're looking for some support or
- [24:33] you're looking to connect with some
- [24:34] other people that are already doing
- [24:35] something like this, then definitely
- [24:37] check out my plus community, the link
- [24:38] for that is down in the description.
- [24:39] We've got a great community of over 200
- [24:41] members who are building with naden
- [24:42] every day. A lot of these people are
- [24:44] also running businesses with NAND every
- [24:46] day. We've got a classroom section with
- [24:47] three full courses. Agent Zero is the
- [24:49] foundations of AI automation for
- [24:51] beginners. We've got 10 hours and 10
- [24:53] seconds where we dive into NN. And then
- [24:54] we have a new course for annual members
- [24:56] called One Person AI Agency where you
- [24:59] learn how to lay the foundation for a
- [25:00] scalable AI automation business. So, I'd
- [25:02] love to see you guys in these live calls
- [25:04] in the community. But that's going to do
- [25:05] it for today's video. If you enjoyed or
- [25:07] you learned something new, please give
- [25:08] it a like. It definitely helps me out a
- [25:09] ton. And as always, I appreciate you
- [25:11] guys making it to the end of the video.
- [25:13] I'll see you on the next one. Thanks so
- [25:15] much everyone.
