- [00:01] I don't think this is a finite game. I
- [00:03] don't think there is a winner. I think
- [00:04] this is the classic Simon Sync Infinite
- [00:06] game. I think um the players are going
- [00:09] to play until they run out of resources
- [00:11] and they can no longer play the game.
- [00:13] And I think we're going to win, right? I
- [00:15] think it opens up a creator ecosystem.
- [00:17] What I hope that it breaks up is all
- [00:20] these kind of web 2 massive companies
- [00:23] controlling everything and we can get a
- [00:25] a more uh surrounded marketplace. All
- [00:29] that and more on today's Mixture of
- [00:30] Experts.
- [00:36] I'm Tim Huang and welcome to Mixture of
- [00:38] Experts. Each week, Moe brings together
- [00:40] a panel of the smartest and most
- [00:42] charming thinkers in technology to
- [00:43] distill down what's important in
- [00:45] artificial intelligence. Joining us
- [00:47] today are three incredible panelists.
- [00:48] We've got Chris Haye, distinguished
- [00:49] engineer, Lauren McHugh Oende, program
- [00:52] director AI open innovation, and Vulmar
- [00:54] Ulleig VP core AI and Watson X AI. So,
- [00:57] this is our Thanksgiving episode and
- [00:58] we're going to change up the format a
- [01:00] little bit. Rather than ticking through
- [01:01] the news of the moment, we're going to
- [01:03] take a step back and have a focused
- [01:04] discussion about the bigger picture.
- [01:06] But, as always, we've got the headlines
- [01:07] with
- [01:12] Hi everyone, I'm Eile McConnen, a tech
- [01:14] news writer for IBM Think. As always,
- [01:17] I'm here to cover your top AI news of
- [01:19] the week. But instead of running through
- [01:21] a bunch of headlines today, we're
- [01:22] actually going to focus on one, the big
- [01:24] news of the week. Anthropic's new Claude
- [01:27] 4.5 Opus model which just dropped. And
- [01:29] to do this, I'm joined by our expert,
- [01:31] Mihi Creetti, distinguished engineer for
- [01:33] Aentic AI.
- [01:35] >> When I heard it was about the latest
- [01:37] model from cloud, I couldn't resist. So
- [01:39] happy to be here.
- [01:40] >> What would you say is the most important
- [01:42] thing that users need to know about
- [01:44] Anthropic's new Claude 4.5 opus?
- [01:46] >> I think it's just how efficient it is
- [01:48] with its tokens. It's 50% more efficient
- [01:51] than Cloud Opus 4.1. So even though it's
- [01:54] a reasoning model, even though it can be
- [01:55] a fairly expensive model, it's cheaper,
- [01:58] but it also consumes 50% fewer tokens
- [02:00] when reasoning. So it's it's one of the
- [02:02] most efficient models out there. So
- [02:04] don't be afraid to use it. Give it a
- [02:06] try. I think the best way to use it is
- [02:08] through cloud code and leveraging those
- [02:11] capabilities and it really performs very
- [02:14] well for how token efficient it is.
- [02:16] >> Mihi, what are some of your initial
- [02:18] reactions to the model after playing
- [02:19] with it? Yeah, it's all kind of fresh
- [02:21] because I think it all happened like 21
- [02:22] hours ago. So, this is all fairly new.
- [02:25] Um, but I've already been using it. I've
- [02:27] been using it with both, you know, the
- [02:30] desktop application and with cloud code
- [02:32] and I can say this is by far the best
- [02:34] model for coding and the bar has already
- [02:36] been set quite high. Uh, as you know,
- [02:38] Google has released Gemini 3 Pro quite
- [02:41] recently and I think uh two three days
- [02:44] ago. Um, OpenAI released GPD 5.1 Pro
- [02:48] which has great reasoning capabilities,
- [02:50] but also they've released GPD 5.1 Codeex
- [02:53] Max, which makes their codeex uh I would
- [02:56] say agentic platform really really good.
- [02:59] I suspect at least from my initial
- [03:01] testing that it was on par or even
- [03:03] better than um cloth code with um the
- [03:06] previous 4.1 models or opus 4.1 or 4.5
- [03:10] set but now with Opus 4.5 I believe uh
- [03:15] entropics has regained the lead in terms
- [03:16] of the best model for coding still doing
- [03:19] some initial testing on it but it's
- [03:22] performing really well. That's super
- [03:23] interesting. And you mentioned this
- [03:25] comes, you know, shortly after the
- [03:26] release of Gemini 3 and we've had some
- [03:29] other big models. You know, what do you
- [03:31] make of the the timing of Anthropics
- [03:32] release? Obviously, it's been a busy
- [03:34] fall for big releases of coding agents.
- [03:37] >> This can't be a coincidence. I'm
- [03:38] wondering if these vendors just have
- [03:40] these models ready to go. Um, they just
- [03:43] might not have the best, I would say,
- [03:45] uh, price performance or they're waiting
- [03:47] from another announcement from their
- [03:49] competitors before they put them out to
- [03:51] market. uh because the timing was really
- [03:53] really good. I mean within the span of
- [03:54] three days we got you know three world
- [03:56] leading models or all for code all
- [03:59] outperforming each other in various
- [04:01] benchmarks which is you know quite
- [04:04] interesting.
- [04:04] >> And are there you mentioned you know
- [04:06] three uh strong performing new agents
- [04:10] you know being released in quick
- [04:11] succession. Is there any aspect of um
- [04:14] the cloud 4.5 opus that is different or
- [04:17] that you know obviously it has it sounds
- [04:19] like slightly superior performance but
- [04:21] you know what what makes this release
- [04:22] different if it is from your perspective
- [04:25] >> I think it's the pricing as well they're
- [04:27] able to reach much better price per
- [04:29] performance or number of tokens used
- [04:31] than the previous 4.1 opus um I was at
- [04:34] some point where I was just using um 4.1
- [04:37] opens for the planning or the more
- [04:39] complex tasks and using 4.5 set or the
- [04:41] previous models for the actual work cuz
- [04:44] they have, you know, a very large uh
- [04:46] context window. They were cheaper, they
- [04:47] were faster. I think they've been making
- [04:50] some optimizations in terms of things
- [04:52] like pricing and performance as well for
- [04:54] Oppus 4 lat 5 and it feels you get a bit
- [04:56] more bang for your buck than the
- [04:58] previous versions of um you know for lot
- [05:00] one opus
- [05:01] >> and can you talk a little bit more about
- [05:03] how you know they've achieved that those
- [05:06] uh a lower pricing you know are there
- [05:08] sort of innovations in how they're
- [05:10] approaching things that have helped them
- [05:12] um to do that
- [05:13] >> I'm not sure it's necessarily to do with
- [05:15] innovation maybe it just has to do with
- [05:16] more availability of the hardware. You
- [05:18] know, they've recently announced some
- [05:20] very, very strong partnerships with both
- [05:23] u Microsoft Azure and with uh Google to
- [05:25] use, you know, more GPUs, more TPUs. Uh
- [05:28] I think part of it just has to do with
- [05:30] having more availability of the
- [05:31] infrastructure and being able to reach a
- [05:34] bit further and say, hey, we're putting
- [05:36] some of our best models out there as the
- [05:37] default. I was actually quite surprised
- [05:39] and maybe even shocked that when I've
- [05:42] opened up
- [05:44] uh cloud code, it recommended 4.5 opus
- [05:47] as the default, which is somewhat
- [05:49] unusual. It might say something like,
- [05:50] "Hey, we're going to use for.1 or we're
- [05:52] going to use for 5 for uh thinking and
- [05:54] then we're going to transition into 4.1,
- [05:56] but outright they've launched a new
- [05:58] version of uh cloud code and it used for
- [06:01] five opus as a default."
- [06:03] >> And I guess it's hard to predict, but
- [06:05] how long does Anthropic have the lead?
- [06:07] you know, we've had is it 48 hours? Will
- [06:10] we have something new by um by next week
- [06:12] or you know, does this set itself apart
- [06:15] such that you'll be using it yourself at
- [06:17] least as your top choice for at least
- [06:19] the coming weeks?
- [06:20] >> I think the way I see it and I'm I'm
- [06:23] using all three models. I'm using Gemini
- [06:26] for a lot of my deep research, my
- [06:28] research, my advisory. I'm using codeex
- [06:32] sorry cloud code with um opus for
- [06:36] writing code or for you know writing
- [06:38] test cases and I'm using uh codeex with
- [06:40] GBD for reviews or for anything else uh
- [06:44] after so I'm actually using all three
- [06:46] but I would say by number of tokens
- [06:49] it's still the entropic models they're
- [06:51] I'm using the most tokens with uh
- [06:53] they're writing the vast majority of the
- [06:55] code for me because they perform the
- [06:57] best for this particular use case. uh I
- [07:00] don't see it necessarily as a
- [07:03] situation where if I had a different use
- [07:05] case I would still use the mouse from
- [07:07] from entropic if it was you know u
- [07:09] summarization or content generation or
- [07:12] creative thinking or creative writing u
- [07:14] maybe I would lean more towards GBD5.1
- [07:17] pro um but at least for in the area of
- [07:20] code it could also be a combination with
- [07:22] what they put in uh the cl code tooling
- [07:25] it still seems to outperform
- [07:28] um codeex at least for my use cases or
- [07:31] from my my personal experience.
- [07:33] >> Do you think for that specific area of
- [07:35] coding does this sort of have enterprise
- [07:37] application or usefulness or you know do
- [07:39] you think that's part of the the play in
- [07:41] trying to bring the cost down to make it
- [07:42] sort of um more enterprise friendly or
- [07:45] yeah how do you see that? Yeah, I think
- [07:47] the strategy of making this available
- [07:49] through the various hyperscalers at um I
- [07:52] would say at a reasonable cost is going
- [07:54] to help with enterprise deployments
- [07:56] because many of the enterprises are
- [07:58] never going to consume the models
- [07:59] directly from the provider. So you know
- [08:01] you're not going to go off and consume
- [08:03] this on if you're using models from open
- [08:06] AAI you're going to consume them likely
- [08:08] on Azure from Microsoft not necessarily
- [08:10] directly from chat GPT. Uh same thing
- [08:13] goes with cloud. You're going to consume
- [08:14] it through maybe AWS bedrock, but there
- [08:16] has been somewhat of a limiting choice.
- [08:18] Uh for enterprises with its availability
- [08:20] through Microsoft Azure, for example,
- [08:23] this has really opened it up to to
- [08:24] enterprise customers and uh uh
- [08:27] consumers.
- [08:28] >> Is there anything else about the model
- [08:30] um you know that's worth worth talking
- [08:32] about that we haven't covered yet that
- [08:34] sort of strikes you as interesting?
- [08:36] Yeah, I think um clearly they've
- [08:37] optimized it for agents, they've
- [08:39] optimized it for computer use, they've
- [08:40] optimized it for coding, but I like the
- [08:42] fact they've also optimized it for
- [08:44] things like building PowerPoint slides,
- [08:45] which was maybe at um something that,
- [08:48] you know, even Microsoft was looking at
- [08:50] these models for for use in Office 365
- [08:53] or, you know, PowerPoint generation,
- [08:54] slide generation. So, they're not
- [08:56] looking just at software development use
- [08:59] cases. They're now starting to tackle a
- [09:01] lot of other enterprise use cases. you
- [09:03] know being the best model for generating
- [09:05] a PowerPoint slide or generating a word
- [09:07] document of generating and working with
- [09:08] you know XML or working with the schema
- [09:11] uh required to build those documents. So
- [09:13] I I I'm I'm pleased and happy to see
- [09:15] that models are being optimized for
- [09:17] these enterprise use cases.
- [09:18] >> I'd be happy to have a model uh to do my
- [09:20] PowerPoint slides as well.
- [09:22] >> Yeah, 100%
- [09:23] >> to optimize. Thank you Mihi so much for
- [09:25] joining our conversation. And now we're
- [09:27] going to return to our special
- [09:29] Thanksgiving episode. Happy holidays
- [09:31] everybody.
- [09:35] Thanksgiving, I think, is like a really
- [09:37] good time to be talking about agents
- [09:39] because, of course, agents have been
- [09:41] very much hyped in 2025, but Agentic
- [09:43] Commerce has been one of the things in
- [09:46] agents that people have been excited
- [09:47] about. And you know, this week is going
- [09:49] to feature Thanksgiving, but also
- [09:50] importantly, Black Friday, which is one
- [09:52] of the biggest shopping moments of the
- [09:54] year. And so, I guess maybe Chris, I'll
- [09:57] kick it to you first. you know, do you
- [09:59] think this week is going to be breakout
- [10:01] moment for agents in Agentic Commerce?
- [10:03] You know, why or why not?
- [10:05] >> No, I don't think it will be. I think
- [10:07] we're probably another year away from
- [10:09] that. Um, why not is that I think all of
- [10:15] the ingredients are getting in place. So
- [10:16] if you think about what OpenAI's done,
- [10:19] they're now bringing on board the
- [10:21] ability to shop in their channel for uh
- [10:24] commerce products and they partnered
- [10:25] with uh you know uh you know Shopify
- [10:29] etc. But there's so many commerce
- [10:32] retailers that they've not on boarded
- [10:33] yet. So I think that's really early and
- [10:35] it is US only at the moment. And then
- [10:37] Google has released their uh agent
- [10:40] commerce protocol and again that's
- [10:43] really early at the moment. So I think
- [10:46] we're and agentic browsers haven't quite
- [10:49] taken off yet. So I I I just think we're
- [10:51] about a year away from that. Now what
- [10:53] where where I do think it's going to
- [10:54] become relevant is utilizing web search
- [10:58] and deep researchers from within chat
- [11:00] GPD to find the products that you want.
- [11:03] That is going to be big and that is
- [11:04] disrupting retailers. But I I I don't
- [11:07] see a massive effect on Black Friday
- [11:09] this year. And what's sort of
- [11:10] interesting and I'd love to kind of
- [11:11] parse that out a little bit more is I
- [11:13] guess Chris you've listed like a couple
- [11:15] key components right it's almost like
- [11:17] the agentic browser is not quite there
- [11:20] the uh you know the the like
- [11:22] partnerships are not right there from a
- [11:24] business standpoint I guess Lauren do
- [11:26] you kind of agree with this assessment
- [11:27] do you think like you know this week is
- [11:29] going to be big for Aenta commerce I
- [11:30] guess you know Chris is almost saying
- [11:32] like I guess there is some in so far as
- [11:34] people are using it to find products but
- [11:36] um it's it's not obviously what we were
- [11:37] promised in the in the the the exciting
- [11:40] early days of 2025.
- [11:42] >> Yeah, my feeling is it's also not going
- [11:44] to be so different from last year. So,
- [11:47] the you know, the protocols that Chris
- [11:48] talked about will help in automating the
- [11:53] actual checkout. Once you're using chat
- [11:55] GBT and you find the thing you want, you
- [11:56] can automate the checkout. But I'm not
- [11:59] sure that was really ever the biggest
- [12:02] problem. You know, I didn't have a big
- [12:03] problem putting in my credit card
- [12:05] manually once I get to the link. They
- [12:07] spent a lot of time making it easy to
- [12:09] spend money on the internet.
- [12:11] >> Yeah.
- [12:11] >> I mean, we've had automated checkout for
- [12:14] a while. It was very hacky. You know,
- [12:16] that's why it's hard to get concert
- [12:18] tickets is because it is possible to
- [12:20] build browser automation to buy things
- [12:23] automatically. So, I don't see a big
- [12:26] revolution coming from the simple act of
- [12:29] being able to check it out once you're
- [12:31] in the AI application. And I do think
- [12:34] too that even the product research
- [12:36] capabilities are a bit underwhelming.
- [12:39] You know, when you know you're looking
- [12:40] for something specific like size,
- [12:42] dimensions or a style or something, it's
- [12:46] not it's not always easy to find that
- [12:49] just through the kind of interface that
- [12:51] we have now. And I think a lot more work
- [12:54] could be done on both training AI models
- [12:57] on e-commerce relevant information. So
- [13:01] you know what are the input output pairs
- [13:03] of input this was the customer intention
- [13:05] output this is what they ultimately
- [13:07] selected and you know allow the AI model
- [13:09] to build those pattern recognition of
- [13:12] okay you know that intention really
- [13:13] meant this size of things or this
- [13:16] configuration so I think there's
- [13:17] definitely work that could be done on
- [13:20] that front of having the models
- [13:21] themselves better uh working better for
- [13:25] e-commerce and then I think there's also
- [13:27] you know when you fit those models into
- [13:29] a aent authentic pattern. How do you you
- [13:33] know prompt it? How do you build in the
- [13:35] steps of that process? So you know like
- [13:38] first by start start by identifying the
- [13:40] retailers you want to look in then you
- [13:42] know get the information you need on
- [13:44] their products then compare them like
- [13:47] that's a whole flow that using a general
- [13:49] purpose um chatbot or you know chat GPT
- [13:53] or whatever pick your system is not it's
- [13:56] not made specifically for that. So I
- [13:58] think if we had more workflows that were
- [14:01] built specifically for that, the
- [14:03] performance of those would go could go,
- [14:05] you know, through the roof that you know
- [14:07] when you have an intention, you can get
- [14:09] a specific link to that product right
- [14:11] away. So I think that's really where I'd
- [14:12] like to see more improvements.
- [14:14] >> Yeah, definitely. Vulmar, I'd love to
- [14:15] bring you in because I think your angle
- [14:17] of this is really interesting. When we
- [14:18] talk about agents, obviously we tend to
- [14:20] talk about like higher up in the stack,
- [14:21] right? It's like the application's not
- [14:23] quite there. Even like the business
- [14:25] partnerships are not quite there to get
- [14:26] this to work. Is there a hardware
- [14:27] limiter to the world of agents really
- [14:29] taking off particularly in commerce but
- [14:31] I guess otherwise or is this not like
- [14:33] almost not even in the picture? So I I
- [14:35] would take a completely different stand
- [14:37] right I think it is actually the year of
- [14:39] agents and the reason is very simple um
- [14:42] if you look at black Friday 15 to 20% of
- [14:46] the stuff gets returned right and so I
- [14:49] think the agents are not the consumerf
- [14:52] facing agents but the agents are
- [14:53] actually the back end and I think this
- [14:55] is where the true adoption happens where
- [14:58] stuff you know people are returning it's
- [15:00] the same after Christmas like you know
- [15:02] it's like statistics like it's unclear
- [15:04] somewhere between 15 and 25%. It depends
- [15:06] on the product category. So if you look
- [15:08] at Amazon today already um you know if
- [15:11] you want to return something it used to
- [15:13] be like you know they they click five
- [15:15] buttons and then they're like okay good
- [15:17] ship it back or no we reject it and you
- [15:19] had to make a phone call. Now that's all
- [15:21] done through agentic workloads. And so I
- [15:24] think from from the big retailers and
- [15:26] probably not I mean Shopify at some
- [15:28] point will offer it as well but the big
- [15:30] retailers uh are already in that motion
- [15:33] of actually optimizing that backend
- [15:35] flow. I do not know what they are doing
- [15:38] when the product hits you know their
- [15:40] their shipping center. um if they have
- [15:42] agentic workloads there I'm sure they do
- [15:45] but that first customer touch point uh
- [15:48] effectively doing like the return I
- [15:50] think that's where the the majority of
- [15:52] the labor is on their side because the
- [15:53] the front end is very optimized so um we
- [15:57] just don't see it as a consumer but we
- [15:59] see it indirectly because actually
- [16:01] return is easier
- [16:03] >> yeah definitely and I think this is kind
- [16:04] of a pattern I did want to talk about I
- [16:06] mean just zooming out from e-commerce
- [16:08] right or like you know buying stuff
- [16:10] online is I think it's almost easy as
- [16:12] like a consumer to be like agents are
- [16:14] the dog that didn't bark in 2025 because
- [16:17] yeah most of the people I know are not
- [16:19] using agents every single day for all
- [16:20] sorts of things but it does seem like on
- [16:22] the back end on the enterprise there is
- [16:24] a lot of agent activity and so it's sort
- [16:26] of interesting is that kind of like the
- [16:28] public face and public experience of
- [16:29] agents is like very underwhelming
- [16:32] whereas you know Vulmar there's like
- [16:33] stuff under running under the hood for
- [16:34] like returns which are like very much
- [16:37] identified um and so we have this kind
- [16:38] of split screen that's happening in in
- [16:41] agents that might actually fool us about
- [16:43] just how far this thing is going.
- [16:44] >> And I think that I mean if you look at
- [16:46] programming agents it's pretty
- [16:47] complicated you know what you need to do
- [16:49] and you need to coers it into doing the
- [16:50] right thing and so I think the consumer
- [16:53] will always uh consume agents indirectly
- [16:56] through products and so it's not like
- [16:58] you know I mean we have like these apps
- [16:59] on the phone where I can automate stuff.
- [17:02] I don't know I I have one automation on
- [17:04] my iPhone which is like when I'm driving
- [17:06] close to our community open the gate.
- [17:08] Okay, that's the only automation I have
- [17:10] out of all the automations I could
- [17:11] build. And so humans typically like you
- [17:15] know they want to have a packaged
- [17:16] product which just solves the problem.
- [17:18] And I think this the beauty of what CHPT
- [17:21] did is giving you that that one line
- [17:23] everybody knows how to use from Google
- [17:25] over 20 years. Um and it's it's really
- [17:28] easy to consume and now they're building
- [17:31] similar to Google all these capabilities
- [17:32] in. So I think that's how we will as a
- [17:35] human we will consume agents. Um but
- [17:37] then in the enterprise no you take your
- [17:39] business process and where every every
- [17:42] place you have a human you can actually
- [17:43] try to put an agent and so I think we
- [17:45] will see adoption indirectly but not
- [17:48] directly now is it the year of the
- [17:50] agents I think we are still in the PC
- [17:53] phase and some companies and so in that
- [17:55] sense I just want to have a contrarian
- [17:57] opinion I think to a certain extent um
- [18:00] the it is probably the year of the agent
- [18:03] PC's let's call it this way
- [18:05] >> okay yeah pilot agent Yeah, the pilot
- [18:07] agents. Yes.
- [18:08] >> Yeah. Chris, go.
- [18:10] >> Yeah. No, it's it's the year of the
- [18:12] agents. I don't you know, I disagree
- [18:14] with Mar. It's the year of the agents.
- [18:16] So,
- [18:17] >> you don't need to caveat that. Uh you
- [18:19] say, yeah,
- [18:20] >> it just is, right? I mean, we we need to
- [18:23] think about this for a second, right?
- [18:24] So, if we
- [18:26] >> look at what has happened with chat GPT,
- [18:28] right? And we'll we'll start from there
- [18:30] and then move outwards. But um
- [18:32] integrated both in it claw Gemini you've
- [18:35] got web search capabilities which is
- [18:37] which is tool calling you've now got the
- [18:39] model catalog so you can hook up things
- [18:41] like your Jira your you know and pretty
- [18:44] much anybody who's got a service uh on
- [18:46] the internet you can hook up as a
- [18:48] connector now and that is basically tool
- [18:50] calling everybody's offering deep
- [18:51] researcher which is a agent behaviors um
- [18:55] and then probably the biggest star of
- [18:56] them all is going to be the coding
- [18:58] agents right that's just went crazy
- [18:59] especially things like claude code if
- [19:01] you think about things like lovable etc.
- [19:03] um everybody uh you know codecs
- [19:06] everybody's using codec uh coding agents
- [19:09] uh to get their work done and the
- [19:10] biggest thing that's made the difference
- [19:11] there is given access to tools so I I
- [19:15] think agents are here and as I said at
- [19:17] the beginning of the year year to super
- [19:19] agent is that um the fact is that with
- [19:23] planning and reasoning these agents have
- [19:26] became really really capable so I I
- [19:29] think uh it can still feel PC like
- [19:32] because everything's maybe not agent
- [19:35] agent agent in the way that you think,
- [19:36] but we are all pretty much using agents
- [19:39] every day. We're just not thinking about
- [19:40] them in that way.
- [19:42] >> Yeah. And I guess they're not weaved
- [19:43] together in kind of like the cohesive
- [19:45] experience that we've been promised,
- [19:47] right? Like Chris, you began by saying
- [19:48] like, well, it's not like Black Friday
- [19:51] like agent commerce is really going to
- [19:53] be happening everywhere because all
- [19:54] these pieces are still missing. They're
- [19:55] they're there, but they just haven't
- [19:57] been kind of orchestrated in a certain
- [19:59] sense. Um, Lauren, I I always joke, you
- [20:02] know, the agentic consumer demo is
- [20:04] always like, you need to book a trip and
- [20:06] he's like, push the button and the trip
- [20:07] is booked. Um, and I guess kind of what
- [20:10] Vulkmar is saying is like that that
- [20:12] isn't that isn't happening. Might take a
- [20:14] really long time to happen. Do you think
- [20:16] it eventually will like will we get to
- [20:18] the much more kind of like consumerry
- [20:21] agentic experience, right? That like I
- [20:23] think that is the source of all these
- [20:25] like splashy videos and startups that
- [20:27] people are working on. Um, or is that or
- [20:29] is that kind of I mean Vulmore what I
- [20:30] heard you saying is almost a little bit
- [20:31] like the future may not actually look a
- [20:34] whole lot like that just because of all
- [20:35] the things you need to package and so
- [20:37] like all the agents might always be kind
- [20:39] of a little bit in the background but
- [20:41] I'm curious about kind of like how far
- [20:43] to the consumer you think the age agent
- [20:45] experience will look like.
- [20:46] >> Yeah, I think the trajectory of just
- [20:49] LLMs standalone is a really interesting
- [20:52] one to compare this to. So LLMs we had,
- [20:56] you know, 2017 the Transformers paper.
- [20:58] Um 2018 was the year that we got BERT
- [21:03] and was the year that we got GPT1
- [21:06] and then 2022 was when we got those
- [21:09] things available to the end consumer in
- [21:12] a very very easy way like in the form of
- [21:14] a web app or a mobile app. So I feel
- [21:17] like where we are with agents is maybe
- [21:18] that 2018 like you know not purely
- [21:22] research paper level but still not in
- [21:24] the hand not 2022 in the hands of every
- [21:27] single person. You know we have like our
- [21:30] GPT1 BERT kind of demos and things to
- [21:33] look at and then I think the big
- [21:35] question is will it take four years to
- [21:38] get into the hands of everyone like it
- [21:40] did with LLMs? You know, there's
- [21:42] definitely reason to think that across
- [21:44] the board, these timelines are
- [21:46] accelerating. So maybe it could be less
- [21:48] than four years. We have way more
- [21:50] attention and investment in this
- [21:53] technology than we did with, you know,
- [21:55] there was just low awareness amongst
- [21:56] the, you know, community of investors
- [21:59] and people who are going to nudge this
- [22:01] along back in 2018 of LLMs. Um, so could
- [22:05] it be faster because of that or could it
- [22:06] be longer because maybe it's a lot going
- [22:09] to turn out to be a lot more complicated
- [22:11] than getting LLMs into production and
- [22:14] into everyone's hands. So
- [22:15] >> yeah, it's like I I do like the idea
- [22:17] this like background hype on AI makes
- [22:19] all downstream AI things happen faster
- [22:22] because everybody's paying attention to
- [22:23] it now. Um, and I guess Lauren, what I
- [22:26] think this is actually one thing I did
- [22:27] want to ask you a little bit about is
- [22:29] that like a big part of this
- [22:30] acceleration is whether or not it's easy
- [22:32] for people to develop agentic platforms,
- [22:35] tools, applications. And do you want to
- [22:38] give just kind of a flavor of the state
- [22:39] of the developer ecosystem right now?
- [22:40] Because I feel like that's a critical
- [22:41] thing. I mean, I think Vulmar said a
- [22:43] moment ago, right, like getting these to
- [22:45] work still takes a lot of work, right?
- [22:48] And so I feel like that in some ways
- [22:49] limits our progress just because like
- [22:50] the number of organizations and people
- [22:52] who can actually do this is like small.
- [22:54] And so one way you increase progress is
- [22:56] you just make it easier for people to
- [22:58] develop for it. And so interested in how
- [22:59] you see the developer ecosystem around
- [23:01] this uh evolving.
- [23:02] >> I think it's a really really fun time to
- [23:05] be a developer if you want to try and
- [23:07] you want to experiment and you can I
- [23:09] mean you can do that no code. There's
- [23:10] things like lang flow that you I mean
- [23:12] it's visual to build an agent and drag
- [23:15] and drop. That's super cool. that helps
- [23:17] you not waste a lot of time coding
- [23:20] something that ultimately you know the
- [23:21] data is just not there or the LLM just
- [23:23] doesn't understand all the way to like
- [23:25] the pro code there's lane chain lane
- [23:27] graph crew AI autogen semantic kernel
- [23:30] there's I mean your choice of things and
- [23:32] some are a bit more easier and
- [23:34] abstracted to use some give you full
- [23:37] control if you want it so I think if you
- [23:39] want to try you have all of the tools to
- [23:42] do that that should never be the problem
- [23:44] I think if you want to actually deploy
- [23:46] deploy that and take it out of, you
- [23:48] know, a very tightly controlled
- [23:50] environment with a very, you know,
- [23:54] precisely specified use case, which is
- [23:56] probably book a trip. Like you said, if
- [23:59] you want to ever, you know, expand
- [24:01] beyond that, actually have it hosted
- [24:02] somewhere, somewhere where you could
- [24:04] invite your friends to try it, that's
- [24:06] where it immediately gets very
- [24:08] complicated and there's far fewer just
- [24:12] obvious options of what you're going to
- [24:14] use. You know, you might have to I mean,
- [24:17] right now it would probably make sense
- [24:19] to you want to deploy an agent and have
- [24:22] it hosted somewhere. You have to figure
- [24:23] out where to host the agent logic
- [24:25] itself, which is not really LLM type
- [24:28] workloads and then a separate
- [24:30] environment to host the actual inference
- [24:33] and then patch those two things
- [24:34] together. So, it's really not ideal. So,
- [24:37] I think you know actually scaling up,
- [24:39] sharing, hosting what you build is the
- [24:42] hard part. So I think it's also one of
- [24:44] the inhibitors right so if you look at
- [24:46] it right now we don't have this packaged
- [24:48] all happy solution and it's the the
- [24:50] entry barrier we are not at the Shopify
- [24:53] level right where the you know a mom and
- [24:56] pop shop can say hey I want to have an
- [24:58] agent and it should you know deal with
- [25:00] something um you know and I think the
- [25:02] the there are some projects we have in
- [25:05] IBM where we take the the um like the
- [25:09] flows and the business um like
- [25:12] description and we're converting that
- [25:14] straight up from English into like you
- [25:17] know an a lang flow and so that
- [25:20] transformation when we are at the point
- [25:22] that you can actually use English to
- [25:25] describe what problem you want to
- [25:26] automate um and not know anything about
- [25:29] programming I think then you get uh you
- [25:31] get it to the masses and then you can do
- [25:33] it on a cell phone right it's like hey
- [25:35] when I come home I want the lights to be
- [25:36] on and not like you know build
- [25:39] automation you know when someone's like
- [25:41] it's it's the the the interface is just
- [25:43] like really it's it's um it's a baby
- [25:46] programmer interface for people who can
- [25:48] program and that's why nobody uses it
- [25:50] right but I mean there there's a logic
- [25:52] and and I can describe that logic in
- [25:54] English so now you need to be very
- [25:55] explicit but I think the models can
- [25:58] already fill in the gaps they are smart
- [26:00] enough for that if you can get to a
- [26:02] point similar to you know right now we
- [26:03] are doing English to code if we can get
- [26:06] English to agent then we are at a point
- [26:08] that it's mass consumable and right now
- [26:11] the interface is are still it's still
- [26:12] built for programmers. It's not built
- [26:14] for consumers.
- [26:15] >> Yeah, that's right. And I feel like that
- [26:16] vision almost shortcircuits it which is
- [26:18] like well do you need a developer
- [26:20] ecosystem, right, for a whole set of
- [26:23] applications? Um which I think is pretty
- [26:25] pretty interesting.
- [26:26] >> I think it's pretty obvious that you
- [26:27] know someone like I always use Shopify
- [26:29] but Shopify was this you know if you
- [26:32] look in the 2000s it was like oh my god
- [26:34] you can you can run a web server on the
- [26:36] internet that's amazing right? So I can
- [26:38] build a billion dollar business and then
- [26:39] Shopify came along and just in fact we
- [26:41] democratized this. We are not yet at the
- [26:44] point it's still high-tech. It's not
- [26:46] democratized. But it's just a question
- [26:48] of time that someone wraps it and says
- [26:50] okay you know I make it really easy and
- [26:52] and that easiness once you have that and
- [26:54] you the complexity goes down by a factor
- [26:56] of 10 or 100 then it will be then you
- [26:58] know everybody will use it because
- [27:00] otherwise you die and I think there will
- [27:02] be an an integration in already these
- [27:04] type of commerce applications. Um, and
- [27:07] so the moment someone figures this out,
- [27:09] well, it will just be wildfire. But I
- [27:11] think that pivotal moment hasn't
- [27:12] happened. The Shopify moment for agents
- [27:15] hasn't happened.
- [27:15] >> Yeah. There's almost a tension between
- [27:17] these kind of two pathways. It feels
- [27:18] like where one of them is Vulmar where
- [27:20] you're talking about which is like
- [27:21] language to agent. If we got that really
- [27:23] good and really powerful, then you
- [27:25] almost don't need to build a lot of the
- [27:27] kind of like deployment infrastructure,
- [27:29] I guess, in some ways that like Lauren
- [27:31] you're talking about, right? which is oh
- [27:32] we've got this like prototype we're
- [27:34] building and then now it's got to be on
- [27:35] some kind of rails for us to like make
- [27:36] it more available. There's kind of a
- [27:39] vision for I guess Vulma where you're
- [27:40] talking about which is like the consumer
- [27:42] just simply types in what they want and
- [27:44] then it it happens basically. Um, I I
- [27:47] guess Chris, maybe to bring you into the
- [27:49] conversation, I think going to kind of
- [27:50] what Lauren is saying about like, okay,
- [27:52] right now there's lots of ways of kind
- [27:53] of like prototyping an agent, but the
- [27:56] minute you want to do anything more
- [27:57] complicated or to scale it, there's just
- [27:59] this like gap in the space. Um, do you
- [28:02] have a sense of kind of like what's
- [28:03] necessary to sort of mature that right
- [28:05] now? Is like we're I guess we're still
- [28:07] waiting on the companies and platforms
- [28:08] that are going to make that happen.
- [28:09] >> Yeah, I I think so. I mean I I think it
- [28:13] is to to take things to your point from
- [28:16] from P and MVP to scale is a hard
- [28:20] problem because you know consumers do
- [28:22] crazy things right so you start to have
- [28:25] to say well am I am I putting the LLM
- [28:27] right in front of the consumer and if
- [28:30] you are at that point then you need to
- [28:32] guard rail it and that could be things
- [28:33] like guard models it could be running
- [28:36] you know deterministic flows in
- [28:38] conjunction with the AI to keep it on
- [28:40] track to Vogmar's point about text to
- [28:43] plans if you look at something like
- [28:45] claude code if you look at something
- [28:47] like cursor wind surf etc almost all of
- [28:50] these things have a built-in planner and
- [28:52] and so when you ask a question the first
- [28:55] thing that happens is it goes to the
- [28:57] planning module for anything complex and
- [28:59] then the model is kept to the plan and
- [29:02] you see that you know we talked about
- [29:03] manis early in the year same sort of
- [29:05] thing right you ask a task it goes the
- [29:07] planning module the planning agent uh
- [29:10] kicks in creates the plan and then the
- [29:12] agents execute to the plan. And and
- [29:14] there's a good reason that exists, which
- [29:17] is if you give an LLM and agent uh a big
- [29:21] list of tools, who knows what tool it's
- [29:24] going to pick, right? And and and and my
- [29:27] favorite one at the moment for this is
- [29:28] the Kimmy K2 model, right? I love the
- [29:30] Kimmy K2 model. It can call 200, 300
- [29:33] tools. It has a long sequential range of
- [29:36] tool call and it can do a massive amount
- [29:37] of tools. But you know what it is? You
- [29:39] give it a tool, it's gonna call it,
- [29:41] baby. You know what it's like? It's like
- [29:43] every tool that it's got, it's like, I
- [29:45] will do it this way. I will do it that
- [29:47] way. It goes off the rails. It's in a
- [29:49] phenomenal model, but it goes off the
- [29:51] rails because it can't keep itself on
- [29:53] track. And then even when you're
- [29:55] executing to the plan, quite often the
- [29:57] models will either use its own memory or
- [30:00] it will not even bother updating the
- [30:03] progress. So, it will be like, "Oh, no,
- [30:04] no, no. I know the answer to this." And
- [30:06] then just answer it, right? as opposed
- [30:07] to no I I need you to use the tool.
- [30:10] Right. Your your information that that
- [30:11] that you've got isn't enough. I need you
- [30:13] to use a tool. And it's like no no no I
- [30:15] know I know this. I know this. And then
- [30:17] gives it Yeah. Exactly. And it's like
- [30:18] you don't got it. I do. I do. I do. And
- [30:20] then and then and even if it does that
- [30:23] once it's done the task when you're
- [30:24] following a plan you want to go executed
- [30:27] step executed step executed. And again
- [30:29] the model if if you're not deterministic
- [30:32] and if you leave the model on its own it
- [30:34] will skip steps in the plan or not even
- [30:36] update it. Right? So actually to that
- [30:38] point about frameworks when you want to
- [30:40] start to get to production that's where
- [30:42] those sort of frameworks become really
- [30:44] important in place but but the reality
- [30:47] is that there's not a lot of you you you
- [30:50] then back to a developer mindset to be
- [30:52] able to put those frameworks in place to
- [30:54] deploy. They're not out of the box. I
- [30:56] think I think when we see that being a
- [30:58] mass thing, those frameworks are either
- [31:01] just going to be part of the platform
- [31:02] and ecosystem you deploy your code onto
- [31:04] it or that's going to be solved at the
- [31:06] model level.
- [31:07] >> So I guess in the last few minutes I
- [31:08] want to talk a little bit about sort of
- [31:10] we've been talking about technically
- [31:11] what needs to happen for 2026 I guess to
- [31:14] be the the the real year of the agent.
- [31:16] Um I'm interested a little bit in sort
- [31:19] of like uh winners and losers and kind
- [31:22] of platforms here, right? Um, you know,
- [31:24] I I guess the question is like are the
- [31:26] winners in agent land from a platform
- [31:28] standpoint going to be the winners in AI
- [31:31] in general, right? Like is it going to
- [31:32] be, you know, open AI and Enthropic that
- [31:35] end up dominating the kind of like
- [31:37] agentic ecosystem? Will it be, you know,
- [31:40] some of the maybe the cloud players that
- [31:41] really end up doing this? Uh, I don't
- [31:43] know if anyone here has any strong
- [31:44] priors on like who's well positioned to
- [31:46] kind of really be the the major platform
- [31:49] for this space.
- [31:50] >> I think there are two questions to
- [31:52] answer. So one is what model or what
- [31:55] model zoo do I need to use um to
- [31:58] actually get good results and what Chris
- [32:01] just said was you know that these things
- [32:03] go off the rails and so you need to kind
- [32:05] of babysit them into giving you the the
- [32:06] right answer. I had a case where I you
- [32:09] know I tried to program something and it
- [32:11] had an API call and the API call didn't
- [32:13] work and so in the end the model just
- [32:15] decided like oh I I just stub it and you
- [32:19] know I just call my own function and
- [32:20] it's like look I'm done it works right
- [32:22] and didn't do anything anymore. So it's
- [32:24] like the solution is don't do anything
- [32:26] and then I'm good and it's like success
- [32:28] congratulations. So I think there's a
- [32:31] the whole like how do we manage the
- [32:34] model and uh that's um that's a hard
- [32:37] problem in itself right um building a
- [32:40] model like right now we are the state of
- [32:42] the world is you need these frontier
- [32:44] models because otherwise the reasoning
- [32:45] capabilities are not not you know not
- [32:48] prevalent enough now I think that
- [32:50] probably next year we will see people
- [32:52] just building like planning models like
- [32:55] you just focus on one thing get the
- [32:57] planning right and then of course the
- [32:59] the models underneath to execute the
- [33:01] plan and not go off the track and right
- [33:03] now I don't think we have done that. Uh
- [33:05] and so I think the the the frontier
- [33:07] models are really the only place where
- [33:09] it can go right now but of course with
- [33:10] humongous cost associated to it. So so
- [33:13] we will see um like the smaller models
- [33:15] being specialized for planning. Um the
- [33:19] uh I think the second question is how
- [33:22] you execute this and where you execute
- [33:24] this. And I think that's a that's a
- [33:26] really good question. My belief is and
- [33:28] this where I'm also taking uh like the
- [33:31] our product is AI is everywhere. There
- [33:34] is no place where AI is not right. So
- [33:37] the idea that we are like oh we're just
- [33:38] putting a bunch of you know H100s or
- [33:40] H200s in the data center and that's
- [33:42] where all the AI will happen. That's
- [33:44] just not true. Like we will see
- [33:46] pervasive application. It will happen on
- [33:48] your cell phone. It will happen in the
- [33:50] data center. And so um the real trick
- [33:53] here is who can make those agents
- [33:55] cost-effective because in the end right
- [33:57] now the work is done right in in
- [33:58] Portugal in in business scenarios um the
- [34:01] work is done by labor right there is a
- [34:03] person who is currently doing it by hand
- [34:06] and what we are hoping for is that the
- [34:07] agents a replace the people who do it by
- [34:09] hand so that the people who are doing by
- [34:11] things by hand can do better things. Um
- [34:14] and then the other one is uh we want to
- [34:16] have agents in the hands where right now
- [34:18] the work doesn't get done at all. right
- [34:20] or poorly. So I we want to get more
- [34:22] choices. And so that one is really now a
- [34:25] cost optimization problem. And so I
- [34:27] think there's an industry at the bottom
- [34:29] of like we need to efficiently run that
- [34:32] capacity that infrastructure so that we
- [34:34] bring down the cost of these agents you
- [34:36] know by 10 or 100x and if we hit that
- [34:39] then it will be pervasive. Right now we
- [34:41] are using it primarily for like high
- [34:43] value tasks which are incredibly labor
- [34:45] intensive right or which are very very
- [34:48] controlled. So I can actually say I have
- [34:50] you know thousands of people doing this
- [34:52] but I can put an agent behind it um
- [34:54] because it's a confined enough problem
- [34:56] space that I can supervise and watch it
- [34:58] and so the moment these things get more
- [35:00] powerful and we bring the cost down I
- [35:02] think then it will be a more pervasive
- [35:04] application.
- [35:04] >> Yeah that's right. I like seeing that
- [35:05] kind of like almost like the market sort
- [35:07] of dividing between sort of maybe like
- [35:08] the existing frontier AI model companies
- [35:11] going more agentic and like that's kind
- [35:13] of one part of the market and then
- [35:14] there's a whole kind of like cost
- [35:16] efficiency universe that kind of emerges
- [35:18] and they they also like you know the
- [35:20] frontier model companies might also get
- [35:22] into that but it's also like maybe looks
- [35:23] like a very different kind of market and
- [35:25] a very different kind of ecosystem. Um,
- [35:28] Lauren, I'm curious about how you divide
- [35:29] up the future agentic market. Is it, you
- [35:32] know, one model model's to rule them
- [35:34] all? You know, is it uh I just kind of
- [35:36] curious there's many ways this could
- [35:37] play out and I'm sort of interested in
- [35:38] how you how you forecast here. Yeah, I
- [35:40] think whoever can make something
- [35:42] repeatable will win because it really
- [35:45] feels like this moment of agents right
- [35:47] now is like traditional AI 10 years ago
- [35:50] where it was really cool that you could
- [35:53] build an AI model to do anything, but
- [35:56] you had to do that from scratch. So you
- [35:58] wanted it to predict education outcomes,
- [36:00] you had to find the data, train the
- [36:02] model just for that, refine it, and then
- [36:05] package it up and use it. And then if
- [36:07] you wanted it to do something else, you
- [36:08] had to start over. It was a whole
- [36:09] endto-end process every time. And that's
- [36:12] kind of what agent building is right
- [36:14] now. And it's even more painful because
- [36:16] it's not just code based, it's language
- [36:19] based. So so much of that rebuilding is
- [36:21] like prompting it and figuring out how
- [36:23] to nudge it in certain directions and
- [36:26] get it to use tools sometimes and not
- [36:27] other times and use the tools in better
- [36:29] ways. So I feel like if there
- [36:33] I mean the breakthrough with traditional
- [36:34] AI was foundation models. We then
- [36:37] trained bigger better models because we
- [36:40] could we had more data we had more
- [36:41] compute and then that one model could do
- [36:45] different things because it knew a
- [36:47] little bit of everything. I think if we
- [36:49] similarly had some concept of foundation
- [36:52] agents it could work similar um and then
- [36:55] you know kind of reduce that friction of
- [36:57] having to build from scratch every
- [36:59] single time.
- [37:00] >> Yeah for sure. And you think the winners
- [37:01] that are best positioned I guess there
- [37:03] would be the existing leaders right like
- [37:05] I guess they take their model polish it
- [37:07] off and then it's the foundation at
- [37:09] Gentic you know model basically
- [37:11] >> and I don't even think it would be model
- [37:12] at this point it would be orchestration
- [37:15] of multiple models plus other um you
- [37:18] know constraints put on that
- [37:21] >> um I really don't know I don't know if
- [37:23] it would be the existing leaders or is
- [37:26] it going to be some dark horse that
- [37:28] builds one agent initially builds one
- [37:30] agent to do one specific thing but then
- [37:33] takes the pieces of that you know
- [37:36] whatever percent of the code and uses
- [37:38] that to do a second thing and then a
- [37:40] third thing and then eventually because
- [37:42] that was kind of the AWS story right is
- [37:43] they were building for themselves to do
- [37:45] something specific initially but then a
- [37:48] lot of that cloud infrastructure could
- [37:49] be used for other things beyond that so
- [37:51] I think there is a scenario where that
- [37:54] happens where someone just commits to a
- [37:56] use case and initially you know they're
- [37:58] kind of looked down upon because they're
- [38:00] using AI to just do one thing but do it
- [38:03] well, but then they realize what the
- [38:05] pattern is to expand to other things and
- [38:07] eventually build something that's more
- [38:09] repeatable and more of a platform.
- [38:10] >> Yeah, that's very rich. I never really
- [38:12] thought about that as basically like
- [38:13] what's the specific agentic problem that
- [38:16] if you solve unlocks the largest number
- [38:18] of subsequent agentic problems and it's
- [38:20] kind of interesting to think about like
- [38:22] is that is that the travel planning one?
- [38:24] Like what what what is that use case?
- [38:26] So, um Chris, do you want to give us a
- [38:28] final thought here before we close up? I
- [38:30] don't think this is a finite game. I
- [38:32] don't think there is a winner. I think
- [38:33] this is the classic Simon Sync infinite
- [38:35] game. I think um the players are going
- [38:37] to play until they run out of resources
- [38:40] and they can no longer play the game.
- [38:41] And I think that's that's that's what's
- [38:44] going to happen, right? So I I think a
- [38:46] lot of the technology and the techniques
- [38:48] is known. I think it's well known across
- [38:51] the world and the limiting factor is
- [38:52] resource. But in an agentic world, the
- [38:55] the models need to get smaller and
- [38:57] smarter and they need and in the future
- [38:58] be able to fit on a chip, right? And and
- [39:00] therefore I I just don't think there is
- [39:03] a winner in this scenario. So who do I
- [39:06] think is going to win? I think we're
- [39:07] going to win, right? I think it opens up
- [39:10] a creator ecosystem. What I hope that it
- [39:12] breaks up is all these kind of web 2
- [39:15] massive companies controlling everything
- [39:18] and we can get a a more uh surrounded
- [39:21] marketplace. That's what I believe in.
- [39:22] And and and the biggest thing if I think
- [39:25] about this is what what I think was
- [39:28] going to happen for 26 and 27 is you
- [39:30] remember the Rick Rubin episode where I
- [39:32] was frantically uh googling who Rick
- [39:35] Rubin was so and I could give an
- [39:36] intelligent answer to your question,
- [39:38] Tim. Um I'm obsessed with Rick Rubin at
- [39:41] the moment because actually I think
- [39:45] composition is where we're going. I
- [39:47] think 26 and 27 is going to be about
- [39:49] marketplace, but I think it's going to
- [39:51] be about being being producers. And
- [39:54] you're going to say, "Okay, I've got
- [39:55] this model over here and I've got my
- [39:56] piece of data and I've got my brand and
- [39:58] my style and I've got these five tools
- [40:00] and then I'm going to combine them
- [40:01] together into my ecosystem and I'm going
- [40:03] to create something new and beautiful
- [40:05] and therefore and that's going to be my
- [40:07] product." And and so I I hope that's
- [40:09] what happens is that it's not this this
- [40:13] one model or whatever is is the winner.
- [40:15] That's a depressing future. What I'm
- [40:17] hoping is this vibrant, amazing
- [40:19] ecosystem and marketplace where
- [40:21] everybody's got a chance to use AI to
- [40:23] improve their lives, personalize it to
- [40:25] them, and create their own company's
- [40:27] products and data without the
- [40:28] limitations that we have today. So,
- [40:30] we're going to be the winners. And but
- [40:32] but I I think these model providers,
- [40:33] they're going to come and go, right? And
- [40:36] we saw that this year. Who you know who
- [40:38] who was Moonshot and Kimmy, right? You
- [40:40] know, ask that question six months ago,
- [40:43] right? And then and then if we go back
- [40:45] last year, who was DeepSeek, right? Same
- [40:47] sort of thing. And and new new model
- [40:50] providers are going to come in. And you
- [40:51] remember when we were super excited
- [40:53] about Manis again? I expect them to come
- [40:56] back at some point. Just people are
- [40:57] going to come in and out and it's and
- [40:59] it's fine and it's okay. But uh yeah,
- [41:01] who knows for the future, but it's going
- [41:02] to be fun.
- [41:03] >> Nice. Well, on that hopeful note, I'm
- [41:06] going to let you all get to your
- [41:07] impending holidays. Uh Vulmar, Lauren,
