- [00:00] A while back, we had taken a look at an
- [00:02] Aentic open-source coding agent that
- [00:05] lives directly inside your terminal, and
- [00:07] it functions completely for free. It's a
- [00:09] perfect alternative to Cloud Code and
- [00:11] Gemini CLI that's called Open Code. We
- [00:14] were actually the first channel to cover
- [00:16] it and since then it has grown
- [00:18] remarkably. For anyone new here, Open
- [00:21] Code is an AI coding agent that's built
- [00:23] for the terminal that is completely
- [00:26] open- source and it actually ships with
- [00:28] better feature sets than most AI CLIs.
- [00:32] You get out of the box LSV support, a
- [00:34] clean and beautiful TUI, more commands,
- [00:37] and an entire different architecture
- [00:40] that makes working in the terminal feel
- [00:42] modern and powerful. And ever since my
- [00:44] last video on open code, it has gotten
- [00:47] drastically better. to a point where
- [00:49] I've genuinely used it over many of the
- [00:51] AI CLI that are available today. Since
- [00:54] our last video, there have been a lot of
- [00:56] changes like we' mentioned, which is why
- [00:58] today I'm back again to explore all of
- [01:00] the new changes a part of Open Code that
- [01:03] will definitely make you want to use it
- [01:05] even more. To start off, Open Code now
- [01:08] includes Mgrep and this alone is
- [01:10] completely a gamecher. Mgrep is going to
- [01:13] make open code four times faster while
- [01:16] using three times fewer tokens. You can
- [01:19] install it super simply using the mpm
- [01:22] install mghrep open code command which
- [01:24] I'll leave in the description below. And
- [01:26] once it's enabled, you can semantically
- [01:29] gp anything. This is what mgp is capable
- [01:31] of doing. It's a commi native way to
- [01:33] semantically grap everything like code,
- [01:36] images, pdfs, and much more. It is
- [01:39] something that will make your coding
- [01:41] agent faster and more efficient. This
- [01:43] means fewer tokens will be wasted.
- [01:46] You're going to get faster results and a
- [01:48] far more efficient terminal agent. Just
- [01:51] take a look at this demo where it
- [01:53] compares open code with mgrep versus
- [01:56] without it. And you can clearly see how
- [01:58] drastically mgrep improves the workflow.
- [02:01] It gets the job done faster, cheaper,
- [02:03] and without sacrificing the quality of
- [02:06] results. Next is where open code is
- [02:09] releasing a new desktop app. This is
- [02:12] something that will be coming soon and
- [02:14] you can join the wait list by obviously
- [02:16] giving your email address.
- [02:20] Something I also realized before making
- [02:21] this video is that open code is coming
- [02:23] out with their own desktop app which is
- [02:26] actually pretty impressive cuz this is
- [02:27] going to make the whole experience a lot
- [02:29] easier to work with. It's not out yet
- [02:31] but the results are pretty impressive.
- [02:34] This is the preview of the new Open Code
- [02:36] desktop app. You have the terminal and
- [02:38] you can manage multiple sessions, which
- [02:40] is something that's really similar to
- [02:42] Warp, but obviously this is better cuz
- [02:44] it's open- source and it actually
- [02:46] functions a lot better than Warp, which
- [02:48] is something that's helped a lot of
- [02:50] people not to use Warp over many of
- [02:52] these free tools that are out there.
- [02:54] This is something that lets you run the
- [02:56] terminal agent directly within the app.
- [02:59] You have a new TUI that we're going to
- [03:01] be showcasing as well with this current
- [03:03] update. And you can easily plan and
- [03:06] build things with the new desktop app.
- [03:08] But speaking of the TUI, the overall
- [03:11] interface of the CLI tool has gotten
- [03:14] drastically better than what we saw
- [03:16] previously. It is a lot easier to work
- [03:19] with. It is super appealing and there's
- [03:21] a lot of fixes to make this overall a
- [03:25] lot better in terms of the user flow. It
- [03:27] has improved drastically on textbased
- [03:30] interfaces, clear, large, and obvious
- [03:33] animations for agents to work and
- [03:36] display their progress. And you have a
- [03:39] lot of different things that makes this
- [03:40] overall interface a lot visually
- [03:43] appealing with less noise and more
- [03:45] focused animations. This new upgrade
- [03:48] with the TUI showcases this right-hand
- [03:51] panel. This is the check-in panel that
- [03:54] showcases the context, how much it was
- [03:56] used, as well as how much you spent. It
- [03:59] will also showcase the LSPs, which is
- [04:01] the language server protocol. Before we
- [04:04] get started, I just want to mention that
- [04:05] you should definitely go ahead and
- [04:07] subscribe to the world of AI newsletter.
- [04:09] I'm constantly posting different
- [04:11] newsletters on a weekly basis. So, this
- [04:14] is where you can easily get up-to-date
- [04:16] knowledge about what is happening in the
- [04:18] AI space. So definitely go ahead and
- [04:20] subscribe as this is completely for
- [04:21] free. Next is where open code also now
- [04:25] has a z.dev extension. This is where you
- [04:28] can now install and start using it with
- [04:30] just one click. You don't need to log in
- [04:32] and you can just simply go ahead and
- [04:34] install it and use it directly within
- [04:35] the zed editor. So you can use the
- [04:37] terminal agent alongside the editor. And
- [04:40] if you do have the zed editor, you can
- [04:42] simply head over to the extension store,
- [04:44] click on install in zed. This will
- [04:46] prompt open the editor itself and then
- [04:48] you can install it with a single click.
- [04:50] By the way, I found an open sandbox
- [04:52] environment that actually hosts the Open
- [04:55] Code SDK which you can access on the
- [04:58] web. Now, I haven't tested this out, but
- [05:01] this is a test project that I found on
- [05:02] Twitter that you can basically use on
- [05:05] the web. This is pretty subtle, but it
- [05:07] is pretty cool cuz Open Code can run
- [05:10] itself and other toys directly within
- [05:12] the agent. This is an update that was
- [05:15] powered by a major node PR and it's
- [05:17] honestly one of the coolest upgrades
- [05:19] that I was able to notice because with
- [05:22] this change any large language model can
- [05:24] actually see the NC output and it can
- [05:27] render it inside the open tui directly
- [05:30] where it appears within the real
- [05:32] terminal. And so if you were to guess
- [05:35] what a tui looks like open code can
- [05:38] visualize it. it can interact with it
- [05:39] and work with the terminal instance that
- [05:42] is just like something a real developer
- [05:44] would actually do. Next is the open code
- [05:47] SDK, a new type safe JavaScript and
- [05:50] TypeScript client that lets any
- [05:52] developer embed and control open code
- [05:55] programmatically. It is the same SDK in
- [05:58] TUI that it uses internally. meaning
- [06:00] anything the TUI can do will basically
- [06:03] have it trigger any sort of TUI actions
- [06:06] that you can automate from your own
- [06:08] code. So this is something that you can
- [06:11] easily install with the client. You can
- [06:13] configure it and it is something that
- [06:16] will also allow you to run multiple
- [06:18] tasks in parallel, build custom
- [06:20] integrations or embed open code directly
- [06:23] into your app which is definitely
- [06:25] remarkable. you can have it so that it
- [06:28] is going to be not just a terminal agent
- [06:30] anymore because with this SDK it is
- [06:32] fully programmable where the AI coding
- [06:35] engine can build on top of whatever
- [06:38] you're working on. Looks like Open Code
- [06:40] also introduced their own curated model
- [06:42] provider that's called Zen. This is a
- [06:45] plug-and-play list of highquality
- [06:47] pre-ested AI models that's optimized
- [06:50] specifically for coding so you get the
- [06:52] best performance without configuring
- [06:53] providers yourself. I am definitely not
- [06:56] recommending to use this cuz I believe
- [06:58] it is something that you can set on your
- [07:01] own where you can just use and configure
- [07:04] uh a planning agent with the Opus 4.5
- [07:06] and then using the Gemini 3.0 as your
- [07:09] code executor. This is the optimal uh
- [07:13] code workflow that I have set and it's
- [07:15] something that I demonstrated in my most
- [07:17] recent video which I highly recommend
- [07:19] that you watch because it is going to
- [07:21] practically show you the best practices
- [07:23] for using AI with coding and in the same
- [07:26] manner you can use that with open code
- [07:28] where you can use the opus for the
- [07:30] architect and then you can use the
- [07:32] gemini model for the coder and if you're
- [07:35] looking to install this it is super
- [07:37] simple you can easily install it with a
- [07:39] single npm command. You can use whatever
- [07:42] you want like bun brew peru as well as
- [07:45] curl. To run it, just simply type in
- [07:48] open code within your terminal. And this
- [07:50] is where you will be able to access the
- [07:52] latest version of open code. And you can
- [07:54] see that it looks a lot cleaner. You can
- [07:57] switch between the different modes like
- [07:59] plan as well as build. And you can
- [08:01] change whatever model you want to use by
- [08:03] using the model command. Now you have a
- [08:05] lot of different options of whatever
- [08:07] model provider you want to use as well
- [08:08] as model and you can actually interact
- [08:11] with these with actual mouse and you can
- [08:14] select the model that you want to work
- [08:16] with. There is different commands that
- [08:18] have been also introduced like opening
- [08:21] the editor directly within the terminal.
- [08:24] You have the ability to switch sessions
- [08:27] where you can run multiple sessions
- [08:28] simultaneously which is a new feature
- [08:31] and different modes like model cycle
- [08:33] reverse switching agents and different
- [08:36] commands that I highly recommend that
- [08:38] you view through. Currently, Grock code
- [08:40] fast one is available for free directly
- [08:43] within open code and you can see this is
- [08:45] the new TUI with the animations on the
- [08:48] left and you have the panel that
- [08:51] showcases the context of what it's
- [08:53] working on. If you like this video and
