- [00:00] The AI ecosystem continues its rapid evolution. Today's users are quickly learning that the
- [00:05] strategic integration of AI's various capabilities into holistic solutions is the key
- [00:11] to unleashing the full power of the technology. But
- [00:18] mapping this Venn diagram of a team's overall goals into an end-to-end AI
- [00:24] strategy with components that work seamlessly together can be . . . puzzling. Let's
- [00:31] investigate how to make AI infrastructure transformation a little less mysterious. In this
- [00:38] talk, I'll explore why AI agents are so powerful.
- [00:44] What the main components of those solutions are.
- [00:51] And then I'll delve into the role AI agents play in the virtual environment and how
- [00:59] they actually enable these solutions. Then we'll put all the pieces together and go through an
- [01:03] example. But first, what is it about these AI agents that are so powerful?
- [01:10] So, unlike traditional AI models that are reactive and predictive, AI agents are initiative.
- [01:16] They're goal-driven, context aware. They actually maintain short- and long-term memories, and they
- [01:22] use that to learn, reflect and adjust future behavior. They can plan things.
- [01:30] They can plan things and they can plan complicated things, multistep workflows. And then
- [01:36] secondly, they can interact within the metaverse to execute that work.
- [01:45] So they can make a plan and then they can get things done. This autonomous power is
- [01:52] really helpful, overcoming the huge hurdle that there is in incorporating AI into infrastructure.
- [01:59] That complexity of combining use cases
- [02:05] with the optimal combination of all of the different models available
- [02:12] today, the software that connects these models and the growing
- [02:19] use of AI accelerator cards is
- [02:26] a challenge that agentic AI can help automate. Because what agentic AI can do
- [02:33] is autonomously assemble these puzzle pieces to form more useful solutions, and that can result
- [02:39] in much, much higher inference and decision accuracy,
- [02:46] and much lower overhead and operational cost
- [02:54] of finding these solutions, because so much is not being done manually by the team. As a result,
- [03:01] productivity of the team and of the AI solution itself goes
- [03:08] up. How these agents do this has a lot to do with their ability to interact
- [03:15] within the metaverse or the software ecosystem. So let's imagine we had a
- [03:21] AI agent. That agent
- [03:28] has ability to interact with many other things in the ecosystem, including
- [03:35] APIs, so it can interact with customer applications, databases to get data
- [03:42] and run models on, basically any resource that's available out in the cloud, as
- [03:49] well as the software running on the box that the agent is actually running on, the
- [03:56] actual computer that that is running the agent, the program. In addition, in some cases,
- [04:04] the firmware for some of these accelerator cards can also interact with the AI agent.
- [04:11] My favorite piece of this is AI agents have the capability to interact with other AI
- [04:18] agents, and those agents can then, in turn, take their task and communicate
- [04:25] with the other pieces of the ecosystem in order to get their task done, and then return control
- [04:31] back to the AI agent. So, to fully illustrate the power of what these agents can do,
- [04:38] let's walk through a real-world example. Let's imagine we're a car insurance company modernizing
- [04:44] our claim process. In this example, uh, we would need an AI agent, um,
- [04:51] that is capable of doing claim processing. So we could create an AI claim agent.
- [05:00] Now, this agent will need to get the claim data that came from the user.
- [05:07] And because it's an agentic piece of AI, it can actually plan a workflow
- [05:14] for what to do with that claim data
- [05:22] and then figure out how to execute it. So, again, absolutely just a simplified example of all the
- [05:29] different things that need to be done to process an insurance claim. But here's just a possibility
- [05:35] of things that would need to be done that the claim agent could recognize and plan for. So, a
- [05:40] claim would probably need to be parsed. It would need to be
- [05:47] matched with the policy, the policyholder's information, and make sure that this
- [05:53] claim is allowed to be covered by this policy. There's likely going to be some image
- [06:00] processing that needs to happen. There's likely gonna be some fraud detect that needs to
- [06:07] happen. As in almost any process these days, there's going to be some audit work that has to
- [06:13] be done. And last but certainly not least, there is client interaction.
- [06:20] Because we might need more data from the client. And at the very least, we need to communicate the
- [06:26] results of the claim back to the client. So there's many ways that this can be done. And
- [06:33] that's gonna vary a little bit based off of the ecosystem that the claim agent is running in.
- [06:38] So depending on the resources that are available to it and what is in that ecosystem, it might make
- [06:43] different choices for processing all the different steps of the claim. For example, to parse
- [06:48] the claim, there could be available to this agent in the cloud
- [06:55] a good NLP model that is effective at doing parsing.
- [07:02] So it might outsource that parsing task out to the cloud. To do the policy match, an LLM
- [07:09] is a pretty good choice. This claim agent could be working on a enterprise
- [07:16] system with software that has capability to offload tasks to some,
- [07:23] say, PCIe attached acceleration card that is really good at handling LLMs. So,
- [07:30] that interaction could be done to offload the policy matching work. The claim agent could then
- [07:36] think, okay, I need to do some image processing. I need to look at these images and determine if
- [07:39] they're fraudulent or not. What are these pictures of? Might have access to a bank of GPUs where it
- [07:46] could send that work to, and run the image processing model there. Fraud is a little bit
- [07:53] interesting.Uh. There's many ways to maybe check for fraud. And but it could so be that in this
- [07:59] particular ecosystem, there is firmware, uh, that is controlling a card that is optimized for fraud
- [08:06] detect models. And so the claim agent, if that is available, could send that over to the firmware.
- [08:12] And that card could process and
- [08:18] determine if there is fraud or if there is not fraud, uh, in the particular claim. If you haven't
- [08:23] interacted with a database already in this process, the claim agent will certainly need to at
- [08:29] least do that for the audit step. And then
- [08:35] finally, at this point, most of the work is done, but the communication of the results and the
- [08:41] output needs to go back to the client. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure the skills you
- [08:47] need to process insurance claims are vastly different than the skills you need to interact
- [08:52] with clients. Certainly, that's true for a human, and I think that would map pretty well to AI
- [08:58] agents as well. So this might be a really good use case to create a second AI agent.
- [09:04] And this agent has a different specialty. This is a client
- [09:12] interaction agent. So it has the tools and capabilities to interact
- [09:18] with client applications. They might also need to reference databases, etcetera.
- [09:25] And that is a more effective tool for getting the job done in terms of communicating
- [09:31] the results back to the user. Just one very simplified example of how these different pieces
- [09:37] can work together, but I hope I've given you at least a little hint of the possibility. So you
- [09:44] see like while words like metaverse and agentic AI might seem mysterious on the surface,
- [09:51] breaking the concept down into the different components and then thinking through how these
- [09:56] components work together to form holistic solutions to real world problems, very much like
- [10:02] the AI agents do themselves, that's the key to understanding the real power of this technology
- [10:08] and sparking inspiration for future possibility.
