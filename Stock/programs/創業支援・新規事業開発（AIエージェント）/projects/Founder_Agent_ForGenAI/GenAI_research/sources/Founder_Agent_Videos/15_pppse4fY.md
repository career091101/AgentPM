- [00:00] My goal for today's video is to provide
- [00:02] you with no BS extremely simple agentic
- [00:05] AI explanation. I'm going to show you
- [00:07] some real agentic AI systems along with
- [00:10] the code. So please stay with me till
- [00:12] the end. We will start with a real life
- [00:15] example of my own company. We have 55
- [00:17] plus people and for these people we want
- [00:20] to build an HR assistant which can
- [00:23] answer simple questions on policies such
- [00:25] as how many vacation days do they have
- [00:27] per year or what is the policy on seek
- [00:30] leave and for this all this policy data
- [00:34] you have it available in PDF files you
- [00:36] can build a retrieval augmented
- [00:39] generation chatboard which can simply
- [00:42] pull the information from this PDF and
- [00:45] answer these questions.
- [00:46] Now is this an agentic AI? The answer is
- [00:50] no. Anthropic has this document on
- [00:53] building effective agents and they
- [00:56] categorize these AI applications into
- [00:58] two categories workflows and agents.
- [01:00] This rack based chatboard is actually a
- [01:03] workflow. It is not agentic. Let's
- [01:05] advance this chatboard a bit more and
- [01:09] let's add a support where you can ask
- [01:12] question. Okay, how many leaves do I
- [01:14] have left? Specifically, you know, as an
- [01:17] employee, how many leaves do I have
- [01:19] left? You can also apply for the leaves
- [01:22] right here. Now, see this is important.
- [01:24] This is not just question and answer.
- [01:25] You are taking actions. So, here you
- [01:28] obviously have access to your policy
- [01:31] data via PDF. But on top of that you
- [01:34] integrated LLM with HR management system
- [01:38] through their APIs where you can not
- [01:40] only pull the leaves for a given
- [01:43] employee you can also apply for a leave.
- [01:46] Okay. So here it will detect your login.
- [01:49] It will identify whether you are moan
- [01:52] Sharma or Abdul Kadir whoever you you
- [01:55] are and it will take the necessary
- [01:59] action. Do we call this agentic AI?
- [02:02] Well, the answer is again no. This is
- [02:04] tool augmented chatboard. We want to
- [02:09] advance this further and give it a goal
- [02:12] such as prepare for Sara's maternity
- [02:16] leave. Now, this requires multi-step
- [02:19] reasoning and multi-turn planning.
- [02:21] Another question, onboard the new intern
- [02:24] joining next Monday. Well, this again
- [02:27] requires multi-step planning. Okay. So,
- [02:30] let's call this a broader goal. It is
- [02:33] not a simple task. It's a complex task
- [02:37] and it requires a multi-step reasoning
- [02:40] first of all and then you come up with a
- [02:42] plan that I need to schedule a welcome
- [02:45] meeting with this intern and you will
- [02:48] actually send the meeting invite via
- [02:50] Outlook or whatever uh calendar system
- [02:53] that you're using. then you might want
- [02:55] to create interns profile in HR
- [02:58] management system. So now you have
- [03:00] integration uh through your HR
- [03:03] management system APIs where it can go
- [03:06] and create interns profile at every step
- [03:10] there will be some generation also right
- [03:12] because you let's say if you want to
- [03:14] schedule a meeting you need to write
- [03:16] some description on what this meeting is
- [03:18] about and all of that you can generate
- [03:20] using this LLM that you have then you
- [03:23] want to create a ticket in IT help desk
- [03:27] where you get Wi-Fi credential s the
- [03:29] email, Slack access, etc. for that
- [03:32] particular intern. Again, here you will
- [03:35] have uh LLM's role being played as well
- [03:39] as you have integration with multiple
- [03:41] tools such as Slack, Outlook, u your
- [03:44] Wi-Fi system and so on. And then you
- [03:47] want to order a laptop. So you have some
- [03:49] kind of you know inventory management
- [03:51] system or some kind of uh IT support
- [03:54] desk where you can issue ID card order
- [03:57] laptop and so on. This is agentic AI
- [04:01] folks. It requires multi-step reasoning
- [04:04] and you have to do multi-step planning
- [04:07] and in each of these steps LLMs will be
- [04:10] involved along with APIs and tools and
- [04:13] knowledge and memory and so on. So if
- [04:15] you describe a few characteristics of
- [04:18] agentic AI system then first one is goal
- [04:21] oriented planning you are not giving a
- [04:24] task such as tell me how many leaves I
- [04:26] have left okay two that is a simple task
- [04:29] you are giving here a complex task which
- [04:35] requires reasoning as well as multi-step
- [04:38] planning okay so the first
- [04:40] characteristic is goal oriented planning
- [04:43] second one is multi step reasoning then
- [04:47] autonomous decision making. See this
- [04:49] system will send an email it will send
- [04:52] uh the invite for the meeting. So all of
- [04:55] that it is doing in a autonomous way. It
- [04:58] is not saying okay go to outlook click
- [05:00] this button. It is actually doing that
- [05:02] work. It is performing actions for you.
- [05:05] Then it has access to tools. All these
- [05:08] tools okay outlook and HR management
- [05:10] system and so on. knowledge which can be
- [05:13] a PDF files, database and so on. It will
- [05:16] also have a memory. So when you are
- [05:17] having a conversation, it will have a
- [05:19] context, it will remember things. So
- [05:22] this is agentic chatboard. Okay. And any
- [05:25] AI system that you are building uh which
- [05:28] has uh autonomy, okay, it it has some
- [05:32] kind of agency where it can make certain
- [05:35] decisions and it can take certain
- [05:37] actions on its own. Plus it has
- [05:40] multi-step complex reasoning and
- [05:42] planning. That system is called agentic
- [05:45] AI. If I have to put it in a very simple
- [05:47] definition, agentic AI is an AI system
- [05:50] that can make decisions and take actions
- [05:52] on its own to achieve a goal without
- [05:56] being told exactly what to do at every
- [06:01] step. Here is a table summarizing the
- [06:03] capabilities of all three chatboards.
- [06:06] The rack based chatboard is reactive
- [06:08] which means more like Q&A. You ask a
- [06:10] question it responds but it doesn't have
- [06:13] tool usage, reasoning etc. The second
- [06:15] one tool augmented chatboard is reactive
- [06:19] and it also has access to tool but it
- [06:22] cannot reason plan and be proactive.
- [06:25] Whereas agentic AI system has all these
- [06:28] characteristics. There are many examples
- [06:31] of agentic AI systems. For example, AI
- [06:33] coding. If you're using lovable or
- [06:35] replet to create a react native app
- [06:38] similar to to-do east okay then see it
- [06:41] will first figure out what kind of
- [06:45] features to-do list has then it will do
- [06:48] see this kind of multi-step planning and
- [06:51] it will then write code execute the code
- [06:55] it will debug it fix issues again write
- [06:58] code execute it and so on okay so AI
- [07:02] coding being done through lovable,
- [07:05] rapit, etc. is an example of an agentic
- [07:08] AI system. The other one is travel
- [07:11] assistant. You might have a travel
- [07:13] assistant where you can say book a 7-day
- [07:15] trip to London in May where where the
- [07:18] weather is sunny for at least 4 days.
- [07:20] This is usually my criteria. You know,
- [07:22] whenever I go anywhere, I want the
- [07:23] weather to be sunny. And you have some
- [07:26] uh budget uh constraints. So now if you
- [07:30] have built agentic AI system, it will
- [07:32] first prepare a plan. You know how
- [07:35] deepsek creates that plan or any other
- [07:38] reasoning model will create a plan. So
- [07:40] it will first create a plan then it will
- [07:43] execute that plan step by step with the
- [07:47] help of all the tools and APIs that you
- [07:50] have integrated. In this particular
- [07:52] system, I might have integrated Acue
- [07:56] weather API for weather, Xedia API for
- [07:59] booking flights and so on. Here is a
- [08:01] small example of agentic AI system where
- [08:04] you are writing an agent to assist an
- [08:07] equity research analyst. They usually
- [08:10] write reports on companies. So here you
- [08:13] are giving a goal. You are not giving
- [08:14] the exit steps. Okay. Write a report on
- [08:17] Nvidia. You're also giving it access to
- [08:21] y finance tool reasoning tools. You can
- [08:23] provide duck duck go search and so on.
- [08:26] And here we are using agno framework.
- [08:28] You can just say pip install agno and
- [08:30] you can run this code. This code is
- [08:32] available in the video description
- [08:33] below. Now when I run this, see here I'm
- [08:36] using gemini as a model here. And what
- [08:40] it will do is it will look at this goal
- [08:43] and it will do multi-step reasoning
- [08:47] planning and then it will execute those
- [08:49] steps. So see here it is doing
- [08:51] reasoning. Okay, I need to gather this
- [08:53] much information. Here is my reasoning.
- [08:56] Then this is the step number two.
- [08:58] Compile a report. Uh you need to perform
- [09:02] all these steps right like getting a
- [09:03] company info, analyst recommendation,
- [09:06] company news. So it is doing all of that
- [09:08] step by step and generating this
- [09:10] comprehensive report which has some key
- [09:13] statistics for that company. Uh analyst
- [09:16] recommendation is one of the common
- [09:18] things you'll find in any uh equity
- [09:20] research report and recent news as well.
- [09:23] I did not say okay have news in the
- [09:26] bottom have analyst recommendation and
- [09:28] so on. It kind of figured it out on its
- [09:30] own. You don't have to always write the
- [09:33] code. You can use low code or no code
- [09:36] tools such as Zapier. Here they are
- [09:38] showing a cloud integration with their
- [09:40] Zapier MCP server and you have connected
- [09:43] all these tools and now you're saying
- [09:44] like what's on my calendar. It will
- [09:46] access the uh calendar tool and it will
- [09:48] tell you uh what do you have then you
- [09:52] can have some other task. See here it is
- [09:55] showing me the calendar items. Then you
- [09:57] can say can you tell me more about this
- [10:00] particular thing and it will call the
- [10:02] appropriate uh tool and it will tell you
- [10:07] l veo is a CEO at whatever company. Uh
- [10:12] these are simple tasks but you can have
- [10:14] complex tasks you can use a reasoning
- [10:17] model and you can uh design your MCP
- [10:21] server such that it can handle those
- [10:23] multi-step reasoning process. The other
- [10:25] tool I want to mention which is similar
- [10:27] to Zapier is
- [10:29] N8N where you can do drag and drop
- [10:32] essentially and see here let's say you
- [10:36] are doing create user form submission
- [10:38] and then it will trigger this AI agent
- [10:40] which has anthropic chat model it has
- [10:44] posgress chat memory it has access to
- [10:46] Jira Microsoft enter ID and so on and
- [10:49] then you can define these kind of
- [10:51] workflows see you can define these kind
- [10:53] of workflows and you can create rag
- [10:56] based system or tool augmented system or
- [10:59] even agentic AI. Okay. So agentic for
- [11:03] agentic AI this AI agent piece is going
- [11:05] to be important. The kind of prompt that
- [11:08] you write you can make it solve really
- [11:11] complex issues using the reasoning model
- [11:14] such as GPT40. You may have this
- [11:17] question what is the difference between
- [11:18] AI agent and agentic AI? Well, you see
- [11:21] this diagram. This is a diagram of an
- [11:24] agentic AI system in an ATN. And any
- [11:28] agentic AI system will have one or more
- [11:31] agents. So here you have this one agent.
- [11:34] You can have multiple agents. Okay. But
- [11:36] you need at least one AI agent with that
- [11:38] agentic complex reasoning behavior. The
- [11:42] second question you might have is what
- [11:44] is the difference between Gen AI? Okay,
- [11:47] Gen AI versus agentic AI. Well, Genai is
- [11:52] part of agentic AI. So you see this
- [11:55] Google Gemini model. So this model might
- [11:58] generate some text. It might write
- [12:00] email. It might summarize something. It
- [12:03] will have all those generation
- [12:04] capabilities and it is one of the
- [12:06] component in your agentic AI system. All
- [12:09] right. So generative AI is related to
- [12:12] generating new data, text, video, images
- [12:14] and so on. And you can have that as a
- [12:17] subcomponent within your agentic AI
- [12:19] system. If you want to see some real
- [12:21] project examples along with the code for
- [12:23] rag and two augmented AI systems then I
- [12:26] have two different videos. We have given
- [12:28] all the code. See the code for both the
- [12:30] projects is here. This is a cold email
- [12:32] generator and the second one is MCP for
- [12:36] that HR le management and also I would
- [12:39] suggest you read this building effective
- [12:42] agents guide by anthropic. They have
- [12:46] mentioned various design patterns. So
- [12:49] this is one workflow based design
- [12:51] pattern where let's say you have a
- [12:53] chatboard and the question might be
- [12:55] routed to a technical support team or a
- [12:59] sales team or some other team. In that
- [13:01] case you can have LLM as a router and
- [13:03] then individual LLMs each for sales team
- [13:06] technical team and so on. Uh everything
- [13:09] is hardwired through code here. So this
- [13:11] is a workflow. There is another example
- [13:14] of a workflow where uh you perform
- [13:16] individual tasks using these LLMs and
- [13:18] then you aggregate them. Okay. Uh here
- [13:21] is another example of orchestrator based
- [13:24] workers. This is also a workflow and
- [13:27] then comes agents. So for agents see
- [13:30] there will be this kind of loop. So
- [13:31] action feedback action feedback you know
- [13:34] multi-step reasoning multi-step
- [13:36] planning. Folks I hope now it is clear
- [13:38] what exactly is agentic AI. It's just a
- [13:41] jargon. The idea is really simple.
- [13:43] Please check video description for the
- [13:45] code and other resources.
