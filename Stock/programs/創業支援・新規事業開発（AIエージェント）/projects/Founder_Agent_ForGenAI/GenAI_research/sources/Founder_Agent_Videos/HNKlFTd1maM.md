- [00:00] So, we built these four AI agents and
- [00:01] got paid $23,000 total by four separate
- [00:04] businesses, and they weren't anything
- [00:06] too complex or advanced. In fact, I
- [00:08] actually started selling agents just
- [00:09] like this a few months after starting
- [00:11] out. So, I'm confident that you could
- [00:12] build and sell something just like them.
- [00:14] In this video, I'm going to walk you
- [00:16] guys through what each agent actually
- [00:17] did, how much we charged per agent, the
- [00:19] exact process we followed to sell our
- [00:21] agents, and how you can sell your first
- [00:23] agent a step by step. And stay to the
- [00:24] end because that's when I go through the
- [00:26] most expensive agent out of the four.
- [00:27] All right, let's start with the first
- [00:29] agent I sold, which was a personalized
- [00:30] outreach agent. Basically, it let my
- [00:32] client drop in a list of contacts,
- [00:34] however many he wanted, and the system
- [00:36] would automatically research each person
- [00:37] and their company, then generate a
- [00:39] personalized outreach message and
- [00:41] follow-up message for them. This agent
- [00:43] didn't actually send the messages or run
- [00:44] the campaigns. It simply filled up the
- [00:46] database with ready to go, customized,
- [00:48] researchbacked messages that he could
- [00:50] then plug into an email or DM sequence.
- [00:53] Super simple, but insanely valuable. I
- [00:55] ended up charging $1,650 for this build.
- [00:58] And honestly, that number was pretty
- [00:59] random. At the time, I had already sold
- [01:01] another agent for 1,200, so that was
- [01:03] kind of my baseline. And I thought to
- [01:04] myself, okay, this one's a bit more.
- [01:06] Let's try 1650. I was clearly a
- [01:09] beginner, and I wasn't even thinking
- [01:10] about ROI back then. But if you actually
- [01:12] do calculate the ROI, it still was a
- [01:14] total no-brainer for him. I think he got
- [01:16] a great deal because he was spending 2
- [01:17] to three hours per week crafting
- [01:19] personalized messages and doing all that
- [01:20] research himself. So, let's say his time
- [01:22] was worth 50 bucks an hour. That's
- [01:24] around $400 a month. With the system, he
- [01:26] instantly got that time back, which
- [01:27] means in about four months, he's made
- [01:29] his money back. And every month after
- [01:30] that, it's pure ROI. Over the course of
- [01:32] a year, that's nearly $5,000 saved. And
- [01:34] that doesn't even count the opportunity
- [01:36] cost of having those extra hours back
- [01:38] every week to actually grow the business
- [01:40] instead of writing repetitive outreach.
- [01:42] Now, how did I actually sell this? Well,
- [01:43] the client found me on YouTube because I
- [01:45] had built something similar on my
- [01:46] channel just for fun. And he emailed me
- [01:48] saying that he wanted something similar.
- [01:50] We hopped on a couple of calls. I scoped
- [01:51] out the build. I told him I could do it.
- [01:53] He said yes. It was that simple. The
- [01:54] crazy part is at this stage I wasn't
- [01:57] positioning myself as a freelancer or
- [01:58] saying that I did paid work. I just
- [02:00] happened to have my email address in the
- [02:01] description of the videos and I was
- [02:03] posting builds online because I was
- [02:04] excited about learning. But because I
- [02:06] was putting myself out there, people
- [02:07] started reaching out and that's how I
- [02:09] was able to close this deal and my other
- [02:11] first ones. So that was the first agent.
- [02:13] Soon after that, things started moving a
- [02:14] lot faster. I'd quit my job. I started
- [02:16] getting more inbound traction and I
- [02:18] realized I couldn't keep doing
- [02:19] everything solo. That's when I decided
- [02:20] to team up with my co-founders and we
- [02:22] started building what's now our AI
- [02:24] business, True Horizon AI. And this was
- [02:25] a big turning point because up until
- [02:27] then, I was just throwing out random
- [02:29] numbers for pricing, like that $1,650
- [02:31] outreach agent. But once I had a team,
- [02:33] we started taking this more seriously,
- [02:34] and we realized we needed to get a
- [02:36] system for pricing rather than just
- [02:38] throwing out a number. That way, instead
- [02:39] of guessing, we could actually sit down
- [02:41] with a client, break down how much time
- [02:43] or money a process was costing them, and
- [02:45] show them exactly how an automation
- [02:46] would save that time or money. and then
- [02:48] we could price the system in a way that
- [02:49] made sense for both sides. That made
- [02:51] selling way easier because clients could
- [02:52] see in black and white that it wasn't an
- [02:54] expense, it was an investment with a
- [02:56] measurable return. And that's how we
- [02:57] ended up landing the second agent that
- [02:58] I'm going to show you guys. So once I
- [03:00] started working with my business
- [03:01] partners Milan and Tyler, we launched
- [03:03] True Horizon AI. We started getting our
- [03:05] internal systems in place and we landed
- [03:07] one of our first products together. This
- [03:08] one was a type of sales agent. The idea
- [03:10] here was simple but really impactful.
- [03:12] The agent could handle customer
- [03:13] inquiries, generate quotes, and
- [03:15] automatically enter everything into the
- [03:16] CRM. It would talk to both the customer
- [03:18] and the orders team, generate an
- [03:20] accurate quote, and then log all the
- [03:22] important details like name, email,
- [03:23] phone number, location, and even a
- [03:25] summary of the conversation back into
- [03:27] the CRM. The value proposition here was
- [03:29] clear. The system would cut down manual
- [03:31] data entry, reduce errors, and free up
- [03:33] the business owner's time so he could
- [03:34] focus on growth rather than repetitive
- [03:36] administrative work. And because it
- [03:38] streamlined operations, it also gave him
- [03:39] a foundation to scale without hiring
- [03:41] more staff. And that was a huge deal for
- [03:43] him because hiring wasn't something he
- [03:45] could yet afford to do. but he still
- [03:46] needed to grow his business. So for this
- [03:48] project, we charged $4,000 and the
- [03:50] client was happy to pay that because we
- [03:52] weren't just automating a small task. We
- [03:54] were removing hours of repetitive work,
- [03:55] setting up a system he could scale with,
- [03:57] and helping him avoid the cost of extra
- [03:59] headcount. Now, let's talk about the
- [04:00] sales process. It started with me
- [04:02] hopping on an initial discovery call to
- [04:04] scope things out. From there, I brought
- [04:05] in my co-founders, Milan, our CEO, and
- [04:07] Tyler, our CTO, to make sure there
- [04:09] weren't any crazy technical requirements
- [04:11] that we were overlooking and that we had
- [04:12] the bandwidth to actually deliver on
- [04:14] this project. After that, Milan and I
- [04:16] ran a second discovery call with the
- [04:17] client and then Milan closed the deal on
- [04:19] the third call. Looking back, we
- [04:20] definitely didn't have our processes
- [04:22] nailed down yet. For example, we forgot
- [04:24] to collect baseline data, which meant we
- [04:26] couldn't build a strong case study to
- [04:27] show the ROI afterward. At the same
- [04:29] time, we were getting flooded with
- [04:30] inbound requests, but didn't have solid
- [04:32] SOPs or systems to handle them. So, for
- [04:35] delivery of this build, Milan, our CEO,
- [04:37] ended up doing a lot of the heavy
- [04:38] lifting himself and then transitioned
- [04:40] into more of an account management role
- [04:42] once we brought on a developer to help
- [04:44] finish things out. But I want to be
- [04:45] clear, you don't need a co-founder or a
- [04:47] full team to land a $4,000 project. What
- [04:49] this really shows is that the jump from
- [04:51] freelancer to consultant to trying to
- [04:53] run an agency is tough. There are
- [04:54] growing pains, and even though you might
- [04:56] be able to charge more, you'll still be
- [04:57] figuring out internal systems along the
- [04:59] way. This third agent that we built was
- [05:01] essentially a personal assistant for a
- [05:02] business owner and his team. It could
- [05:04] provide quick access to internal data
- [05:05] sources, streamline task management, and
- [05:07] improve team productivity, all directly
- [05:09] inside Slack, which was where the
- [05:11] company lived most of the day. The value
- [05:12] prop here was all about productivity,
- [05:14] centralizing data retrieval, automating
- [05:16] routine admin tasks, and enabling faster
- [05:18] communication without switching between
- [05:19] tools. Now, when it came to pricing,
- [05:22] this one was trickier. With sales or
- [05:23] outreach agents, it's easy to calculate
- [05:25] how much time you're saving. But with
- [05:26] something like a personal assistant, the
- [05:27] value is a little more variable because
- [05:29] those small admin tasks don't happen on
- [05:31] a set cadence. So, it's harder to
- [05:33] directly tie them to ROI. So, we ended
- [05:35] up charging $6,000 for this project. And
- [05:37] even though we tried to back that number
- [05:39] with some ROI calculations, the truth is
- [05:42] we priced more on complexity of the
- [05:43] build rather than the actual long-term
- [05:45] value. Valuebased pricing is obviously
- [05:47] the way to go and something that we
- [05:48] didn't learn right away. And when you
- [05:50] really break it down in terms of value,
- [05:51] I actually think that we should have
- [05:53] charged more for the sales agent than we
- [05:54] did for this personal assistant agent.
- [05:56] If you think about the way that the
- [05:57] usage and leverage of a system actually
- [05:59] compounds with a process like a sales
- [06:01] agent compared to a personal assistant
- [06:03] administrative agent, it becomes very
- [06:05] clear because if the sales agent
- [06:06] converts those leads, the business grows
- [06:07] and as the business grows, more leads
- [06:09] come through. So the usage of the system
- [06:10] grows and this creates like this
- [06:12] flywheel where the ROI of the system
- [06:14] actually exponentially scales. And
- [06:16] that's something that's not as clear
- [06:17] with a personal assistant because as the
- [06:18] business grows, does the personal
- [06:20] assistant usage grow? Maybe it does,
- [06:22] maybe it doesn't, but it doesn't scale
- [06:24] in the same way. And that's an important
- [06:25] lesson because pricing in this space is
- [06:27] hard and it takes time, data, and
- [06:29] experience to get it right. Looking
- [06:30] back, I know we were pricing too low
- [06:32] because our close rate was insanely
- [06:34] high. If you're closing over 50% of your
- [06:36] proposals, it means your clients are
- [06:37] realizing that they're getting a steal,
- [06:39] and this is the market telling you that
- [06:40] you need to charge more. It means that
- [06:42] you're rarely getting push back on your
- [06:43] pricing, which is a strong signal that
- [06:45] you're doing it too low. So, anyways,
- [06:47] the sales process for this project
- [06:49] looked a lot like the previous one.
- [06:50] Milan and I ran the discovery calls. We
- [06:52] brought in Tyler, our CTO, to doublech
- [06:54] checkck the technical scope and then we
- [06:55] closed the deal. But this is where our
- [06:57] growing pains really showed because in
- [06:58] order to deliver this build, our CTO
- [07:01] ended up being the one in the weeds
- [07:02] developing the workflow. And that's not
- [07:04] how a CTO should spend their time. He
- [07:06] should be managing a team of engineers
- [07:08] and innovating, which is what Tyler's
- [07:09] passionate about and does best, not
- [07:11] being stuck in the weeds of a build
- [07:13] connecting nodes to an agent. So this
- [07:15] process was another reminder that
- [07:16] scaling a team doesn't automatically
- [07:18] make things easier. It actually gives
- [07:19] you more things to manage, more moving
- [07:21] pieces, and more chances for
- [07:22] inefficiency. But by the time we got to
- [07:24] our next agent, we were in a much better
- [07:26] place. We had stronger SOPs, better
- [07:28] systems. And because of that, we were
- [07:29] finally able to charge double what we
- [07:31] just charged for this one. Finally, the
- [07:33] fourth agent we sold was a full AI
- [07:35] concierge. This one was designed to
- [07:37] support a client's business by helping
- [07:38] their members with everything they
- [07:39] needed. Onboarding, finding and starting
- [07:41] events, managing guest passes, offering
- [07:43] support, and even keeping a running
- [07:45] conversation history across all the
- [07:47] members. In other words, it acted like a
- [07:49] virtual secretary, a single point of
- [07:51] contact that could handle the day-to-day
- [07:52] tasks of guiding users and keeping the
- [07:54] business running smoothly. And because
- [07:56] the company was launching a new offer,
- [07:57] our AI concierge was critical in helping
- [07:59] them get it off the ground quickly
- [08:01] without hiring more staff. This was also
- [08:03] right around the time that MCP servers
- [08:04] started to become a big deal online and
- [08:06] we were able to transition the scope and
- [08:08] architect to incorporate this new
- [08:10] technology which was another value lever
- [08:12] for us to pull here by showing the
- [08:14] client that we stay bleeding edge and
- [08:15] are always looking for the newest
- [08:17] technology. This was by far one of the
- [08:19] more complex systems that we had built
- [08:20] up to this point and that's why we
- [08:22] charged $12,000. The client could
- [08:24] clearly see the value because the agent
- [08:26] was basically filling the role of an
- [08:27] intern or assistant but at a fraction of
- [08:29] the long-term cost of hiring. The good
- [08:31] news was by this point our internal
- [08:33] systems were finally catching up to the
- [08:35] size of the projects we were landing. We
- [08:36] had a dedicated account manager keeping
- [08:38] the client communication smooth. Our CEO
- [08:40] was in the right spot, focusing on sales
- [08:41] strategy, operations, and growth. And
- [08:43] our CTO was finally managing a team of
- [08:45] engineers instead of being stuck
- [08:47] building by himself. And for me, I
- [08:49] finally had more freedom to spend time
- [08:50] creating YouTube videos and focusing on
- [08:52] the front end of the business instead of
- [08:54] being buried in client projects. So this
- [08:56] project wasn't just a win because of the
- [08:57] $12,000 price tag. It was proof that we
- [09:00] had gone from scrappy freelancers to
- [09:02] consultants, then to building a business
- [09:04] with real systems that could handle
- [09:05] bigger and more valuable clients, and
- [09:07] now looking to scale our operations. All
- [09:09] right, so we've walked through the four
- [09:10] agents that we sold. Now, the question
- [09:12] is, how do you actually do this
- [09:14] yourself? This is the exact road map
- [09:15] I've followed as a freelancer, then when
- [09:17] I built my own agency, and now with my
- [09:19] co-founders at True Horizon as we
- [09:21] started to move up market. And it's the
- [09:23] same road map you can follow to start
- [09:24] landing your first real AI automation
- [09:26] clients. Step one, diagnose the problem.
- [09:29] Prescribe a solution. The very first
- [09:31] step is learning to think like a problem
- [09:32] solver. The value isn't in the fact that
- [09:34] you know how to wire up nodes in your AI
- [09:36] workflow. The value is your brain and
- [09:38] your ability to understand how a
- [09:40] business runs, where it's leaking time
- [09:42] or money, and where an automation can
- [09:44] fix that. For example, don't pitch, I
- [09:46] can build you an AI chatbot. Instead,
- [09:48] say your team spends 15 hours a week
- [09:50] answering repetitive client questions. I
- [09:52] can build a system that cuts that down
- [09:54] to almost zero, freeing them up to close
- [09:55] more deals. That shift takes you from
- [09:57] just being a builder to being a business
- [09:59] partner. Number two, pick simple tools.
- [10:01] Once you've identified the problem, the
- [10:03] tools are just the way you solve it. For
- [10:05] 90% of use cases, simple building blocks
- [10:07] like Naden, vector databases, and an AI
- [10:09] model or two will get the job done. But
- [10:11] don't over complicate the step. Many
- [10:13] freelancers underpric because they think
- [10:14] in terms of technical effort. Clients
- [10:16] don't care if it takes you 2 hours or
- [10:18] 20. They care about the outcome. Selling
- [10:20] workflows and templates may have worked
- [10:21] when the space first started up, but if
- [10:23] your value is defined by the templates
- [10:24] you give out, it's all becoming
- [10:26] commoditized. You should leverage
- [10:27] templates to help you build quicker and
- [10:29] smarter, but the value is how you were
- [10:30] able to customize them to fit the
- [10:32] client's needs. Step three is to
- [10:34] multiply the hours saved by the hourly
- [10:36] rate by 4 weeks, and that's how you get
- [10:38] to monthly savings, and then just times
- [10:40] that by 12 to get to annual savings. So,
- [10:42] number four is to package and anchor
- [10:44] your offers. Don't just blurt out a
- [10:45] number. Try creating tiered packages
- [10:47] like a starter plan, a growth plan, and
- [10:49] a scale plan so clients can self- select
- [10:51] and always lead with the highest anchor.
- [10:53] So, for example, our scale package is
- [10:55] 25,000 and it includes these
- [10:56] functionalities, but most clients
- [10:58] actually go with the growth package at
- [10:59] 12K that has these functionalities.
- [11:01] Suddenly, that 12K feels like the smart
- [11:03] middle option. Packaging makes you look
- [11:05] professional. Anchoring makes your
- [11:06] pricing logical, and together they stop
- [11:08] clients from comparing you to hourly
- [11:10] freelancers. Number five, avoid the
- [11:13] traps. There are a couple of silent
- [11:14] killers that you need to watch out for.
- [11:16] One of them is underpricing. It attracts
- [11:17] the wrong clients and makes it nearly
- [11:19] impossible to raise your rates later.
- [11:21] Number two is under scoping. Saying yes
- [11:23] to just one more feature without
- [11:24] rescoping will destroy your margins and
- [11:27] always define exactly what's included
- [11:28] and create a change request process for
- [11:31] anything outside the scope. Number three
- [11:32] is chasing small retainers too early.
- [11:34] One $10,000 project is often more
- [11:37] profitable and better for your mental
- [11:38] health and business reputation than five
- [11:40] $2,000 a month retainers. Stability
- [11:43] comes from having a lead pipeline, not
- [11:45] from having retainers. And just another
- [11:47] quick reminder to raise your rates
- [11:49] regularly. If your close rate is way
- [11:51] above 40 to 50%, it's a clear signal
- [11:53] that you're underpricing. For B2B
- [11:54] consulting services, a 20 to 30% close
- [11:56] rate is considered strong. So, if you're
- [11:58] not receiving any friction or push back,
- [12:00] you're going down a bad path where your
- [12:01] CLV or customer lifetime value is going
- [12:04] to be way too low. Number six, we have
- [12:06] prototype and QA. Now that you've priced
- [12:08] and packaged the deal, it's time to
- [12:10] build. But don't overthink it. Prototype
- [12:12] fast. get a working version live, then
- [12:14] test. At True Horizon, we follow a
- [12:16] simple QA cycle, which is one week of
- [12:17] internal QA. We run it through a sample
- [12:19] and a real data set. We stress test it
- [12:21] with edge cases, and we fix issues
- [12:23] before the client sees anything. And
- [12:24] then we give the client a week to QA,
- [12:26] where he or she will test it in the real
- [12:28] world, give us feedback, and then we're
- [12:29] able to iterate and make those
- [12:31] adjustments. The QA process does two
- [12:33] things. One, it protects you from edge
- [12:34] case failures, and two, it shows your
- [12:36] client that you're professional,
- [12:37] reliable, and looking out for their
- [12:39] business. Number seven, building
- [12:40] long-term partnerships. Finally, just
- [12:42] remember this. You're not selling
- [12:44] one-off automations. You're building
- [12:46] relationships. Your early projects
- [12:47] position you in the client's mind as
- [12:49] either the cheap freelancer or the
- [12:50] strategic AI partner. Long-term value
- [12:52] comes from collecting data and case
- [12:54] studies from every project, turning one
- [12:56] project into multiple by showing
- [12:57] measurable ROI, offering ongoing
- [12:59] optimization or expansion once trust is
- [13:02] established, and building relationships
- [13:03] with more than just one person in the
- [13:05] customer's organization. When you can
- [13:07] clearly demonstrate this system saves
- [13:09] you 10 times what you paid me, clients
- [13:11] stop thinking about cost and start
- [13:12] thinking about how else they can work
- [13:14] with you. So if you want to follow the
- [13:16] same path, here's the road map. Spot the
- [13:18] problem, pick simple tools, price based
- [13:20] on ROI, package an anchor, avoid the
- [13:22] traps, prototype, and build long-term
- [13:24] partnerships. That's the exact framework
- [13:26] that I've used to find success selling a
- [13:28] agents. And it's the same one that we
- [13:30] will still use today at True Horizon. So
- [13:32] that's going to do it for today. I'm
- [13:33] going to have this full resource pack in
- [13:35] my free school community if you guys
- [13:36] want to access that. It just basically
- [13:38] goes over everything that I just talked
- [13:39] about here so you can reference that
- [13:41] later. And if you're looking to go even
- [13:42] deeper with this kind of stuff and you
- [13:43] also want to connect with other people
- [13:45] who are building businesses with NN,
- [13:46] then definitely check out my plus group.
- [13:48] The link for that is also down in the
- [13:49] description. And by the time you're
- [13:50] watching this, we just dropped a full
- [13:52] course called automation to monetization
- [13:54] where I talk about how you can actually
- [13:55] start to monetize your AI skills now
- [13:57] that you are not just advanced in edited
- [13:59] end, but you're also becoming advanced
- [14:00] in AI implementation and becoming a
- [14:02] problem solver for these businesses. And
- [14:04] trust me, these businesses desperately
- [14:06] need someone to help them out with their
- [14:07] AI implementation road maps. If you guys
- [14:09] enjoyed or you learned something new,
- [14:11] please give it a like. Definitely helps
- [14:12] me out a ton. And as always, I
- [14:13] appreciate you guys making it to the end
- [14:14] of the video. I'll see you on the next
- [14:16] one. Thanks everyone.
