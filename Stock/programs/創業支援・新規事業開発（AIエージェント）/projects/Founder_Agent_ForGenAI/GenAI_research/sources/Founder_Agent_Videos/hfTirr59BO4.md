- [00:03] Let's say I'm building a code assistant
- [00:05] uh application and the response times
- [00:08] need to be really really fast. Time to
- [00:09] first token really matters in a coding
- [00:11] assistant scenario, right? And then if
- [00:13] you are in the advanced stage of
- [00:16] workflow integration means you have
- [00:19] already thought about going to
- [00:20] production. You have completed those
- [00:22] checks but now you still have issue on
- [00:24] how do I integrate this application
- [00:27] along with some other things. Is there
- [00:29] API or SDK that needs to be built around
- [00:31] it so that it can be integrated better?
- [00:33] How do I manage traffic? Right? I might
- [00:36] get spikes on weekdays between 10:00
- [00:38] a.m. and 1:00 p.m. How do I handle for
- [00:40] that? Should I just increase my capacity
- [00:42] during those 3 hours and then scale it
- [00:45] down? Should I have a cluster? How
- [00:48] should I be building my applications?
- [00:49] Right? So, Jenn applications uh if you
- [00:52] are building within your organization at
- [00:53] different stages, you have different
- [00:55] challenges. Okay?
- [00:57] The challenge also is from who is asking
- [01:00] the question, right? So you have geners,
- [01:02] managers, CTO, CIO, CEOs and and so on,
- [01:05] right? So if you're a gener, you are
- [01:08] trying to develop with some coding
- [01:10] assistant, cursor, github copilot, uh ru
- [01:13] code, client, I mean there are so many
- [01:16] of them right uh these days. Uh lovable
- [01:18] is there uh windserve I can just go on
- [01:21] and name it one after the other. But
- [01:24] then there is also choice about okay
- [01:26] should I use crew AI for my
- [01:27] orchestration framework should I use uh
- [01:29] Google's agent development kit should I
- [01:31] use langraph lang chain uh AWS came up
- [01:35] with strands Microsoft has autogen openi
- [01:38] also has swam and then hugging face has
- [01:40] small agents
- [01:42] if I'm not good at programming to begin
- [01:45] with especially in gen space is there a
- [01:47] no code low code alternative these are
- [01:49] the questions that you would likely have
- [01:52] as a gener Right? If you are a manager,
- [01:55] you're looking to evaluate and develop
- [01:56] robust yet cost effective ways for user
- [02:00] access management and your application
- [02:02] to be available to everybody who needs
- [02:04] access to those LLMs and have those
- [02:07] costs budgeted for. If you're CTO as a
- [02:11] technology person, you should be focused
- [02:12] on security, guardrails, observability
- [02:14] of your ja application. What is getting
- [02:17] sent? What happens? uh they call it
- [02:19] negative testing. But what happens if
- [02:21] you are asked a question uh to your HR
- [02:23] chatbot about some war in some two
- [02:26] different countries should it is it
- [02:28] supposed to answer that question? How
- [02:30] are you going to protect your chatbot
- [02:31] from kind of giving out uh your
- [02:34] computers information? So these are in
- [02:36] these are things that are considered by
- [02:38] your technologists within the company
- [02:40] the decision makers in order to
- [02:42] safeguard your interest right and then
- [02:44] the last one is for CIOS CEOs kind of
- [02:48] they want to see that what's the usage
- [02:51] that we built an application it is kind
- [02:53] of in dev or it's in production let's
- [02:54] say what are my costs every month how
- [02:57] many requests is it serving how many
- [02:59] people is it helping right and that is
- [03:01] true for every ja project you might have
- [03:03] five different departments within in
- [03:05] your organization each with its own
- [03:07] workspace own set of people and they are
- [03:09] all building different applications at
- [03:11] the CEO CIO level you want kind of
- [03:14] observability across all of them at
- [03:17] individual department or workspace level
- [03:19] but also at the entire organization
- [03:21] level so if these are your different
- [03:25] challenges right let's look at the types
- [03:27] of gen engineers because I am assuming
- [03:29] most of you are builders right you're
- [03:31] here because you want to get some
- [03:33] hands-on experience building jenna
- [03:35] application and we are going to show
- [03:36] some examples but you will be one of
- [03:38] these three right either you are of
- [03:40] category and I didn't want to name them
- [03:42] because there are different types of
- [03:45] developers and engineers here.
