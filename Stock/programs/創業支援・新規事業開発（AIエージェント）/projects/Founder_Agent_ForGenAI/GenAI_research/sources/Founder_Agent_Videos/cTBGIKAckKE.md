- [00:00] Everyone is building AI agents nowadays
- [00:02] but most of them remain stuck in
- [00:04] prototyping phase. If you want to unlock
- [00:06] a real business value out of it, you
- [00:09] need to deploy them to production at
- [00:11] scale. And there is one platform that
- [00:14] allows you to build, deploy and operate
- [00:16] these AI agents in a secure manner. The
- [00:19] name of that platform is Amazon Badrock
- [00:22] Agent Core. In this beginner-friendly
- [00:24] tutorial, we are going to first build
- [00:26] customer care AI agent using Langchen
- [00:29] and Langraph. Then we will deploy it and
- [00:32] operate it from Amazon Bedrock Asian
- [00:34] core environment. We are going to cover
- [00:36] all the essential features of this
- [00:38] platform and in the end we are going to
- [00:41] announce one challenge. The top 20
- [00:43] winners of this challenge will get $250
- [00:46] of AWS credit. All right, let's get
- [00:49] started. Let's look at the problem
- [00:51] statement of our project. There is this
- [00:53] company called Loki phones which is in a
- [00:55] wireless calling business similar to
- [00:57] Verizon or Reliance Jio and they want to
- [01:00] build an AI agent that can answer the
- [01:03] customer's questions. So right now they
- [01:06] have this uh CSV file with questions and
- [01:08] answers. So right now the human agents
- [01:11] that they have whenever customer is
- [01:13] calling uh the call center and when they
- [01:16] ask any question they refer to this CSV
- [01:18] file. So this is their knowledge base.
- [01:20] Okay. So we are going to use this
- [01:22] knowledge base to build an agent in
- [01:25] langraph using rag agentic rag actually
- [01:29] and once that agent is built we will
- [01:32] deploy it and operate it using agent
- [01:34] core environment. This diagram
- [01:37] highlights the main capabilities of this
- [01:39] platform. You will first build an agent
- [01:42] using any framework of your choice
- [01:45] langraph crewi etc. So you are
- [01:48] essentially writing the code in any of
- [01:50] these frameworks.
- [01:52] Then you will use some of these
- [01:55] capabilities to build the agent. For
- [01:57] example, you need memory for your agent.
- [02:00] Then you use this memory feature of
- [02:02] agent core platform. You can also use
- [02:06] code interpreter browser which are the
- [02:09] built-in tools.
- [02:11] You may want to call external rest API
- [02:14] or MCP server. And for that you can use
- [02:18] gateways. For inbound and outbound
- [02:21] authorization you will use identity.
- [02:25] And you don't want to run your agents
- [02:28] without setting up the proper
- [02:30] boundaries. For example, if a customer
- [02:32] is issuing a refund beyond certain
- [02:35] threshold, then you want to stop there.
- [02:39] And to do that, you will use policies.
- [02:42] So you can have a policy which will say
- [02:44] that do not allow to issue refund beyond
- [02:48] certain threshold. So these are the
- [02:49] resources you will use along with the
- [02:52] code which is written in any of the
- [02:54] frameworks to build an agent and then
- [02:57] you will deploy it using runtime. Once
- [03:00] the agent is deployed when you want to
- [03:02] monitor it you will use the
- [03:04] observability feature. So here you can
- [03:06] monitor and debug your agent. You can
- [03:09] also use this evaluation feature here.
- [03:11] By using pre-built evaluators and custom
- [03:14] evaluators, you can figure out how good
- [03:17] your agent is. So there are three
- [03:20] essential highlights here. The first one
- [03:23] is time to value. See, you are just
- [03:25] focusing on the business value that your
- [03:29] AI agent is delivering. You don't have
- [03:31] to worry about your infrastructures and
- [03:34] operational headaches. Okay. So you know
- [03:37] that AWS platform is very popular
- [03:39] because uh in general it helps you avoid
- [03:43] those operational and infrastructure
- [03:45] headaches for your regular software
- [03:48] developments. Similarly agent core will
- [03:51] help you remove the headache of
- [03:53] infrastructure and op management for
- [03:56] your AI agent. The second key highlight
- [03:59] here is it is very flexible. You can
- [04:02] create your AI agent using any framework
- [04:05] or model. And the third one is it is
- [04:08] trusted. Okay, there are uh security
- [04:11] guardrails. There is AM authentication.
- [04:15] You can deploy them. They can scale
- [04:18] well, right? In the end, it's AWS. So
- [04:20] you can scale them in a reliable manner.
- [04:23] We are going to explore all these
- [04:25] features when we build, deploy, and
- [04:29] operate our AI agent. All right. So as
- [04:31] the next step we are going to now do the
- [04:33] gro setup, hugging face setup and we
- [04:36] will start building the agent in
- [04:38] langraph. Hugging face is a platform
- [04:41] that allows you to access variety of
- [04:43] models and data sets for free. We are
- [04:46] going to be creating an account by
- [04:48] clicking on this sign up link and having
- [04:51] this account created will give you the
- [04:53] HF token and we can use HF token later
- [04:56] on in this video. I have given my email
- [04:59] id and password. Let's click on next and
- [05:03] here
- [05:04] just give your name right full name
- [05:09] uh you can give other details if needed
- [05:12] and then create an account you'll go
- [05:14] through some verification some more
- [05:17] verification and success okay now check
- [05:21] your email so I'm going to open my email
- [05:26] in another link
- [05:29] and
- [05:31] copy paste that particular link which I
- [05:34] got from my got in my email and your
- [05:37] address has been verified. Now here you
- [05:41] can go to access tokens and create a new
- [05:44] token.
- [05:46] So it has three type of tokens. We are
- [05:48] going to be using read because we'll be
- [05:50] using the the read operation mainly. So
- [05:53] just give a token name. You can say
- [05:56] agent code tutorial
- [05:59] whatever just just just say something
- [06:02] and then copy that and save it at a safe
- [06:05] place. For LLM we are going to be using
- [06:08] this Gro platform. It's a free cloud
- [06:11] platform that allows you to use all
- [06:13] these amazing models. Look at this
- [06:15] GPTOSS Lama all of that. Creating an
- [06:19] account is pretty straightforward. You
- [06:20] can use Google or your email and just
- [06:24] create an account. Once the account is
- [06:26] created, go to API keys and create a new
- [06:29] API key and note down that API key at
- [06:32] some secret place. This is like your
- [06:34] password and we will be using that API
- [06:37] key later on. While we are going to use
- [06:39] Grock for this learning project, many
- [06:42] companies which are in AWS ecosystem
- [06:45] prefers Amazon Badrock for LLMs. Bedrock
- [06:49] provides so many different LLMs. So you
- [06:52] can click on this and you will see see
- [06:56] all these models. You have Claude Opus,
- [06:58] Amazon Nova, Quain you have so many
- [07:03] different models that you can choose
- [07:05] from and for enterprise setup staying in
- [07:08] same ecosystem makes so many things
- [07:11] easier for your project. Let's create a
- [07:13] folder to store our code. So here I will
- [07:18] create a folder called agent core
- [07:22] tutorial.
- [07:23] Okay. And we are going to provide you
- [07:26] all the code of uh this uh complete
- [07:30] video and that code is in agent course
- [07:33] uh crash course. So if you check the
- [07:35] video description below you'll be able
- [07:37] to download this entire directory and
- [07:40] from this I want you to copy pi
- [07:43] project.toml toml file and also loi qna
- [07:47] csv file. Okay. So let's Ctrl C these
- [07:50] two file. Actually the third file is
- [07:52] sample env. Ctrl C and put this here.
- [07:59] Then launch the ID of your choice. I
- [08:02] like PyCharm. And in PyCharm I'm going
- [08:05] to open that project. So that project is
- [08:08] where it is in C code directory. It is
- [08:13] called agent core tutorial. So I'm
- [08:16] selecting that folder. I'm going to open
- [08:19] it. Okay. So I have this different code
- [08:22] window. So I'll move it here. And then
- [08:27] this is the project where I'll be doing
- [08:30] my work. So we're going to first create
- [08:32] the local agent. Okay. And we will be
- [08:36] using UV as a package manager for
- [08:39] Python. Now UV is a alternative of pip.
- [08:43] Okay. It allows you to install the
- [08:45] packages and so on. So go to their
- [08:48] website if you have not already
- [08:51] installed it. You can go to their
- [08:53] website and you can install it. See I'm
- [08:55] in Windows. So I'll go to my PowerShell.
- [08:57] Okay. So you can open your PowerShell
- [09:01] power shell from your command prompt and
- [09:04] in that PowerShell just copy paste this
- [09:07] this command and it will install it.
- [09:10] Okay. So UV is installed for me and now
- [09:13] I will go to terminal and in this
- [09:16] particular folder I will call it UV in
- [09:19] it. Okay. So here project is already
- [09:23] initialized in this. Okay. So this file
- [09:26] is already exist because this toml file
- [09:28] exist. It will say okay this project is
- [09:31] initialized. Okay. So that is fine. Now
- [09:33] you will say uv sync. So what this will
- [09:36] do is so let me open pi project toml. So
- [09:39] see here I have specified all the
- [09:41] dependencies for this project you know
- [09:43] all the modules we need lang chain lang
- [09:45] graph sentence transformer and so on. So
- [09:48] when you say uv sync it will read that
- [09:51] pi project toml file okay and it will
- [09:54] install all of it. If you want to add
- [09:56] any additional package, right? Like you
- [09:58] can just say whatever.
- [10:01] For example, let me just let me just
- [10:04] type the same thing like lang for
- [10:06] example
- [10:10] and see. So this way it will initialize
- [10:14] the environment for you and it will uh
- [10:18] install essentially all these
- [10:20] dependencies for you. The next thing you
- [10:22] will do is look at this sample env file.
- [10:25] Okay. So, Ctrl Ctrl +V you will copy it
- [10:30] as env file and in this file put your HF
- [10:35] token and grow KPI key. We already got
- [10:38] the values of these two. Okay. So, just
- [10:39] copy paste the token and API key. Okay.
- [10:42] So, I set those things up. Now, let's go
- [10:45] to agent core crash course directory and
- [10:48] copy this 00 langraph agent.py pile.
- [10:51] Okay. So, we are going to copy this here
- [10:56] and then I will go open this file. Now,
- [11:00] see this is the simple agent that we
- [11:03] have created and what this agent is
- [11:05] doing is a pretty simple thing. We have
- [11:08] this Loki Q&A CSV file, right? So, let
- [11:11] me open it in a Excel so that it's uh
- [11:14] there is a better visibility of it. It
- [11:17] is just a question and answer pairs for
- [11:20] this particular company. Okay. Any
- [11:22] customer department in any company will
- [11:25] have this kind of FAQ. Okay. If customer
- [11:27] ask question how long does activation
- [11:29] take? Okay. Give this answer. Okay. So
- [11:32] we have this particular file here and we
- [11:37] are reading that file. See load faqsv.
- [11:41] So we are reading that file by calling
- [11:44] this uh load faqsv function. See here we
- [11:48] are loading that this particular file.
- [11:50] Then we are using hugging face embedding
- [11:54] sentence transformers. Okay we are also
- [11:56] using this rag approach. Now if you
- [11:58] don't know how rag works we have many
- [12:00] other tutorials. I'm going to provide
- [12:02] you a link. So the purpose of this video
- [12:04] is not to explain you rag. Okay. We want
- [12:06] to move to agent core quickly. That's
- [12:08] why
- [12:09] uh I'm just keeping things uh really uh
- [12:12] quick and you are loading dot
- [12:14] environment through which you will load
- [12:16] those environment variables and here we
- [12:19] are creating a chat group using the GPT
- [12:23] OSS uh model okay and then as a next
- [12:27] step what you're doing is by the way
- [12:29] even if you don't do this it's okay
- [12:30] because we have done the load
- [12:33] environment okay and we are using
- [12:36] creating this agent
- [12:37] create agent which will take our model
- [12:40] GPTOSS model and tools. Okay, what are
- [12:43] the tools? Well, that we have two tools.
- [12:45] Okay, so first tool is search FAQ. For a
- [12:48] given query, it will do rag approach. So
- [12:52] in rag, you will retrieve the
- [12:54] semantically matching text blocks from
- [12:57] your vector database. Okay, so vector
- [12:59] database is phase from Facebook and then
- [13:03] we pass that to our context uh in the
- [13:06] llm and let's say if you want to
- [13:08] reformulate the query you use these two
- [13:10] tools okay so we essentially have these
- [13:12] two tools folks look at this code it's
- [13:15] pretty straightforward as I said if you
- [13:17] don't know rack fundamentals I'm going
- [13:18] to provide you another tutorial link
- [13:20] okay so we have created this agent which
- [13:23] has a model which has bunch of tools and
- [13:24] we are asking these questions okay
- [13:26] explain roaming activations So now let's
- [13:29] right click and run it. And before you
- [13:31] run it, you need to set your system
- [13:34] interpreter properly. So interpreter.
- [13:38] Okay. So what is my interpreter? So here
- [13:42] my interpreter as you can see is
- [13:46] agent core tutorial in which you have v
- [13:49] environment script python. Make sure
- [13:51] this setting is set up. Okay? Otherwise
- [13:53] you can add a local interpreter. Let's
- [13:55] say if this is set up to a different
- [13:56] value, you can add a local interpreter.
- [13:59] You can say select existing and you can
- [14:02] go to your directory uh agent code
- [14:06] tutorial
- [14:07] v environment scripts and here here
- [14:11] select python. Okay. And which is what I
- [14:14] have already. So I don't need to make
- [14:16] any change. Okay. And then right click
- [14:19] and run the project. So now it's using
- [14:23] that particular virtual environment and
- [14:25] it is running my agent. It took some
- [14:27] time but here is the answer. I asked the
- [14:30] question on okay roaming related
- [14:32] question and it provided me this answer.
- [14:34] Okay. So my local agent is now built and
- [14:38] ready to be deployed to agent core.
- [14:40] Agent core runs within AWS. So obviously
- [14:43] we have to set up AWS account which is
- [14:45] something we are going to do next. If
- [14:47] you already have the account created
- [14:49] then skip this section folks. We will be
- [14:51] using AWS in the upcoming chapters. So
- [14:54] let's first set up the account. You can
- [14:56] Google create AWS account and click on
- [14:59] this link here. Click on create a free
- [15:03] account link. If you already have an
- [15:06] account then you can skip this video.
- [15:08] You can log into your account. But if
- [15:10] you don't then
- [15:13] sign up for AWS and here provide your
- [15:16] email address. Okay. And then you can
- [15:18] provide some AWS account name. I'm going
- [15:21] to say code basics double whatever uh
- [15:24] account name doesn't matter that much.
- [15:26] But here you can provide your Gmail ID.
- [15:29] Once you do that, it will send an email
- [15:31] to your email ID to verify. So I have
- [15:35] done the verification and now I can uh
- [15:39] provide my password.
- [15:42] So just provide a password and proceed
- [15:45] further. Okay. At some point uh it will
- [15:48] ask you for selecting your plan. So I'm
- [15:50] going to say okay free 6 month plan.
- [15:53] Okay. So let's select that. And uh you
- [15:57] can provide all the details here.
- [16:05] So see in the previous screen it asked
- [16:08] me for my credit card. It is not going
- [16:10] to charge actually they just do this
- [16:12] credit card verification. So you will
- [16:14] get some free credits. Okay. So you can
- [16:17] provide your credit card details etc.
- [16:20] And then it will um ask you for this SMS
- [16:24] just for another verification. So here
- [16:26] it send a code on my phone. So I'm just
- [16:29] confirming my identity. See it will
- [16:31] require multiple step of verification.
- [16:35] Okay. So now see my AWS account is set
- [16:38] up. At any step if you're feeling stuck
- [16:41] folks use common sense. You have to use
- [16:43] common sense. Take help of chat GPT.
- [16:46] Setting up an AWS account should not be
- [16:48] a rocket science. You should be able to
- [16:49] figure it out folks. Okay? So please do
- [16:51] that. And now I can go to AWS console
- [16:55] where I'll be able to kind of see
- [16:58] different offerings and different
- [17:00] options that AWS has. Let's now install
- [17:04] AWS CLI version v2. So just Google it
- [17:08] and you will uh go on this particular
- [17:11] page. AWS CLI is a way to access your
- [17:15] AWS environment via command line
- [17:18] interface. Now based on the OS you have
- [17:21] you can click on one of these. So I have
- [17:23] Windows. So I'm going to click on this
- [17:25] and I will install it. So you can
- [17:26] install it via MSI. So if you click on
- [17:28] it you know you can just execute this
- [17:32] and install it. The other way is you can
- [17:34] use a command line. So I'm going to use
- [17:36] command line. So just copy this thing
- [17:38] and in Windows start the Windows
- [17:42] PowerShell. Okay. So type in Windows
- [17:44] PowerShell
- [17:45] and you will get this and
- [17:50] hit this and it will come up with this
- [17:54] uh thing. Okay. So it will install it.
- [17:57] It will take some time. Just follow your
- [18:00] common sense uh steps to finish the
- [18:02] installation.
- [18:06] Okay. So for me installation is going on
- [18:08] and I'll be back when this is complete.
- [18:11] It installed after few minutes it was
- [18:13] actually slow and when you run AWS
- [18:16] version I can see AWS CLA version 2. I'm
- [18:19] into my AWS management console where you
- [18:22] can see different services. So here you
- [18:24] can click and search for S3 for example.
- [18:28] So S3 is a service within AWS
- [18:30] environment that lets you store objects
- [18:33] and people use it for data lake and
- [18:35] variety of other purposes. You will also
- [18:37] see agent core. Okay. So bedrock agent
- [18:41] core you will see all kind of services
- [18:44] and whatever service you have used
- [18:45] recently they will be visible here. Now
- [18:48] one of the important services is
- [18:51] identity and access management. So we
- [18:54] will go here and we will create a new
- [18:57] user because see right now you are
- [18:59] logged in as a root user which has all
- [19:02] kind of access. We want to create a user
- [19:05] with some limited access.
- [19:08] So let's call it agent core user.
- [19:12] I will give it my name. Okay, double
- [19:15] and provide access to AWS management
- [19:18] console. Which means this user will be
- [19:21] able to login into this account, right?
- [19:23] This particular account that I have and
- [19:25] they will have access to this management
- [19:28] console. Okay. So autogenerated password
- [19:31] is good. User must create a new
- [19:33] password. Okay. We can uncheck it. It's
- [19:35] a learning tutorial. Then you go next.
- [19:39] Add user to a group. Okay. So I will
- [19:43] create a new group. I will call it agent
- [19:48] core
- [19:50] group. Um let's say I'm in the AI team.
- [19:54] Okay. See these groups are used to group
- [19:56] the users. So let's say you are working
- [19:58] in a company. There is a data analysis
- [20:01] team, there is AI team, there is data
- [20:03] engineering team. So you'll create three
- [20:05] groups, right? AI, DE, DA, those kind of
- [20:09] groups. And here you are going to give
- [20:12] certain accesses. So I'm going to give
- [20:14] it administrator access. Okay. Then I
- [20:18] will also give the Bedrock full access.
- [20:22] So let's search
- [20:24] Bedrock. Amazon Bedrock full access.
- [20:28] Okay. So let's do this. and then uh code
- [20:34] build. So AWS code build admin access
- [20:39] and the fourth one is bedro
- [20:43] agent core full access
- [20:47] and say create a user group. So
- [20:50] essentially I have created a user group
- [20:52] who has access to all these
- [20:55] capabilities. Okay. So what are the
- [20:56] capabilities? Okay. They can access
- [20:59] bedrock. they can access agent core you
- [21:02] can give access to S3 and so on then you
- [21:05] select this so the user that I'm
- [21:07] creating I want it to be part of this
- [21:09] particular group click on next I think
- [21:13] default options all okay everything is
- [21:16] good create a user and when it creates a
- [21:20] user it will give you the console sign
- [21:23] in okay so let's say whenever you want
- [21:26] to login as this user you will use this
- [21:29] sign
- [21:29] this username and this particular
- [21:32] password. So you can note it down
- [21:33] somewhere in a safe location. You can
- [21:36] also download the CSV file which will
- [21:39] contain those credentials. So that CSV
- [21:42] file that I downloaded has this username
- [21:44] console signin URL and the password.
- [21:48] Okay. So now let's return to the user
- [21:52] list. So I have that CSV save. You also
- [21:55] save that CSV file to a safe location.
- [21:58] Now let's go to that user. Click on this
- [22:01] user and click on create access key.
- [22:06] Click on command line interface. Okay, I
- [22:09] understand the above recommendation. So
- [22:11] right now what I'm doing is
- [22:13] for this user I'm creating an access key
- [22:16] which I will supply to AWS CLI. Okay.
- [22:20] And that way from CLI which is a command
- [22:24] line interface. command line interface I
- [22:26] will be able to access this account as
- [22:28] that particular user. Okay, as we as we
- [22:32] work on this tutorial you will
- [22:33] understand what I'm trying to do here.
- [22:35] Just say create access key. Now it has
- [22:37] created access key and secret access
- [22:39] key. So now go to your PowerShell and
- [22:43] say AWS configure. So you have AWS CLI.
- [22:49] It will configure the default account.
- [22:52] And what is my default account? Well, it
- [22:54] is this particular user agent core user
- [22:56] dual and for this you need agent AWS
- [23:00] access key ID. So AWS access key is
- [23:02] this. So let's type in this. Okay. And
- [23:07] then the password. So copy this.
- [23:16] Default region is US East one. I will
- [23:19] keep it default. If you are in Asia
- [23:22] something provide your region okay and
- [23:24] you can Google you can use chat GPT and
- [23:26] you can say okay I'm in Delhi whatever
- [23:28] Mumbai what region I should provide or
- [23:31] sometimes you know you can you can see
- [23:33] your region here like from the drop down
- [23:35] so use your common sense figure out I
- [23:37] live in US east coast so I'm going to
- [23:40] say US east one the default output
- [23:43] format I will say it is JSON
- [23:47] and that's it now I want to make sure
- [23:49] that This configuration is okay. So
- [23:51] let's type in this command. AWS STS get
- [23:53] caller identity and I see my user ID my
- [24:00] account right so my user ID so if I go
- [24:05] to let's click on done. You haven't
- [24:08] viewed or downloaded a secret key. Oh I
- [24:11] see. So I will also download this secret
- [24:13] key somewhere. Okay. So it's in another
- [24:16] CSV file. Okay. We had initial CSV file
- [24:20] for my user credential. This one is the
- [24:23] user's access key. So two CSV file.
- [24:25] Okay. So let's make sure you have copied
- [24:27] it to a safe location. I will click on
- [24:31] done and see here when I say STS get
- [24:35] caller ID my ARN which is Amazon
- [24:38] resource number right it's see resource
- [24:40] name is this user agent core user double
- [24:44] see so it has configured it properly.
- [24:47] You can also run this command where you
- [24:49] say AWS S3 LS. So it will list down the
- [24:52] buckets that you have. Okay. So in my
- [24:55] account here, see it is showing me all
- [24:57] these buckets. Sportsbar DP sales double
- [25:00] SF1. And when I go to my S3 service
- [25:04] here, let's go to S3. And if I look at
- [25:08] my buckets, see I'm finding all those
- [25:10] buckets. You see sports bar, sales, DF,
- [25:13] stocks, daily data. So this means my AWS
- [25:18] C cli so CLI I'm running on my local
- [25:21] computer via Windows PowerShell it is
- [25:23] having now access to my AWS account on
- [25:25] cloud. So now using this command now I
- [25:28] can perform different operations on my
- [25:30] cloud account. Now comes the most
- [25:32] interesting part which is running agent
- [25:35] in the Amazon badro agent core
- [25:38] environment. So here
- [25:40] type in badrog agent core. Okay, click
- [25:44] on it. So, it will show you the page for
- [25:48] badro agent core. And it has different
- [25:50] capabilities or or different services
- [25:52] such as runtime, identity, gateways,
- [25:56] memory, observability and so on. Right
- [26:00] now, we are going to use runtime to run
- [26:03] our agent which we ran locally
- [26:05] previously into agent core environment.
- [26:09] So let's go to our code and here let's
- [26:13] create a new file. Okay. Or maybe I can
- [26:17] just copy paste this. Ctrl Ctrl +V and
- [26:20] let's call this agent core runtime.py.
- [26:24] Okay.
- [26:26] So this is the file I have and this is
- [26:28] the agent that we ran previously. So we
- [26:31] know it is working. So now we are going
- [26:34] to import
- [26:36] some library here. So let's uh import
- [26:40] this bedrock agent core runtime. From
- [26:43] that you are importing bedro agent core
- [26:45] app and you are creating an instance of
- [26:49] this app. Okay. And then you will write
- [26:53] an entry function. So let me show you
- [26:56] that entry function. So that entry
- [26:59] function is going to be let me see here
- [27:04] is the system prompt
- [27:07] agent let me put it here.
- [27:10] Okay. So whenever we call this
- [27:13] particular agent from the agent core
- [27:15] environment
- [27:17] due to this annotation it will invoke
- [27:20] this particular function and it has
- [27:23] payload and context. Okay. So what what
- [27:26] you get from payload and and context is
- [27:30] payload is used to pass information such
- [27:33] as prompt. So it's a dictionary. It will
- [27:36] have different elements. One of the
- [27:38] important elements will be prompt. So
- [27:41] when you invoke this agent, you will
- [27:43] supply this prompt and it will come in
- [27:45] payload uh variable
- [27:49] and then you will invoke it. Okay. So
- [27:52] once you have a query of course you will
- [27:56] the same agent object that you use you
- [27:57] will invoke it then you will have uh the
- [28:01] result here we are just printing all of
- [28:03] that for our verification and you return
- [28:06] this uh result in your main file you
- [28:10] will just say app.run run. All right. So
- [28:13] now we have made our agent such that it
- [28:16] can run in the agent core environment
- [28:18] and you you saw that this API is so good
- [28:20] that we have to make only few lines of
- [28:22] code change, right? We just added these
- [28:24] two lines and we created this invocation
- [28:27] function. So in a few line of code
- [28:29] change now your agent is ready to run on
- [28:32] agent core environment.
- [28:35] Now let me okay let me use this
- [28:37] terminal. Okay. So in my PyCharm I am in
- [28:40] this particular terminal
- [28:43] and let me just move it on the right. So
- [28:46] move to
- [28:48] right
- [28:50] right top that way I can show you things
- [28:53] side by side and here I am going to run
- [28:56] this command agent core help. Now I got
- [29:00] this command because in pyro.tml TML
- [29:05] toml file if you remember we have
- [29:06] installed all the necessary libraries.
- [29:09] Okay. So the help shows couple of
- [29:13] functions. So the first function that we
- [29:16] are going to use is agent core
- [29:19] configure. Okay. So let's do this. So I
- [29:22] will say agent core configure-
- [29:27] e and then see in this directory right
- [29:30] agent core tutorial directory I have a
- [29:34] file called zero
- [29:38] agent core runtime this is the file
- [29:41] right this is the file we created so
- [29:44] agent core
- [29:46] runtime dopy
- [29:50] let's see what this will do and then
- [29:52] I'll explain the the purpose of it. So
- [29:54] here I'm running this command and it is
- [29:57] asking me bunch of information. So
- [30:00] essentially I am creating a YAML file
- [30:03] which will contain all the necessary
- [30:05] information for agent core to run this
- [30:09] particular agent. So first it is asking
- [30:11] me for the name of the agent. Okay. So
- [30:15] let's provide name of the agent
- [30:18] then.
- [30:20] Okay. Dependency file is pi
- [30:22] project.toml. Yes, exactly. Let's do
- [30:26] this. Execute role ARN name. Press enter
- [30:29] to autocreate. So I will just say enter.
- [30:31] It knows. Remember we configured AWS
- [30:34] configur. We configured everything. So
- [30:36] it will know which ARN to take. ECR is
- [30:39] Amazon's uh elastic container
- [30:43] repository. Okay. So it will use that.
- [30:46] We are going to provide it as a default.
- [30:48] And also by the way deployment
- [30:49] configuration we have used container uh
- [30:53] deployment type as container. So
- [30:55] container is a dockerbased deployment.
- [30:57] So it will create a docker and use the
- [30:59] docker for the deployment. So ECR press
- [31:02] enter to take whatever is the default.
- [31:05] Configure o by default it uses AM. Okay.
- [31:09] I want to use IM. I don't want to use O.
- [31:11] So let's say no here. And then configure
- [31:15] request
- [31:16] allow head. Okay, hit enter using
- [31:20] default and then u here memory manager
- [31:25] initialization for no existing memory
- [31:28] resources found. Press enter to create
- [31:30] new memory. Type s to skip memory setup.
- [31:33] So I'm going to skip the memory setup.
- [31:35] So press s enter and that's it. Okay.
- [31:40] Now what this did is it has created this
- [31:44] bedrock agent core yamel file which I'm
- [31:48] going to open.
- [31:50] So our agent is not deployed yet. Okay.
- [31:53] Uh all it did so far is created this yl
- [31:58] file and it's a configuration file
- [32:00] right. It says okay platform is this
- [32:02] deployment type is runtime your entry
- [32:04] point is this particular file your
- [32:07] source path is this. uh it is showing me
- [32:10] all the all my AWS my AWS account ID all
- [32:14] of that okay so you can you can explore
- [32:16] this file now the next step is to use
- [32:19] launch so agent core launch and here we
- [32:23] are going to supply the environment
- [32:25] variable because our environment
- [32:28] variables are stored in environment
- [32:32] I'm going to supply so I will say that
- [32:37] uh here grock
- [32:46] API key is equal to I will supply my
- [32:49] key. Okay. So I have supplied my key.
- [32:51] Hit enter. And now it is launching this
- [32:56] a agent. Right. So it is launching as in
- [32:59] it is uh deploying this agent to the
- [33:02] Asian core environment. After some wait
- [33:05] looks like it worked. Okay.
- [33:07] I see only green boxes. There is no
- [33:09] error etc. And now we are ready to
- [33:14] invoke our agent. So we can just say
- [33:18] agent core invoke and type in your
- [33:21] question. So now this is going to call
- [33:23] the agent and I will get my response. So
- [33:25] I had some issue with the formatting
- [33:27] which I fixed. So I am passing double
- [33:29] quote outside and single quote inside.
- [33:32] So it called the agent core in the cloud
- [33:36] environment. So my agent is now running
- [33:38] in agent core AWS cloud environment and
- [33:42] when I said invoke this it sent this
- [33:45] request to that agent and then I got
- [33:49] this response back here and when I go to
- [33:52] bedrock you see my agent is ready. So
- [33:55] when I actually launched it at that time
- [33:58] this agent was ready. Make sure you are
- [34:00] passing the correct region. Okay, so I
- [34:02] was having east two. East two doesn't
- [34:04] have anything.
- [34:06] But remember we used east one as a
- [34:08] region. So it has this also you get this
- [34:12] jai dashboard. So if you click on it, I
- [34:16] will get this link where I don't see
- [34:18] anything. But let me change my region to
- [34:20] two. So ES2.
- [34:24] And here let's see what it is showing. I
- [34:27] think it's not showing anything because
- [34:29] there are two things like you need to
- [34:30] wait for 10 minutes or so and it also
- [34:34] requires span injection. So we can
- [34:35] ignore this for now. One additional
- [34:37] thing I want to mention is this page
- [34:40] that mentions AWS capabilities by
- [34:43] region. So if you say start exploring
- [34:46] and let's say you want to figure out a
- [34:48] specific capability whether that is
- [34:51] available in a specific region or not.
- [34:53] In that case, let's say we want to know
- [34:57] Asian core where is it available. So
- [34:59] right now I'm in US East one and it is
- [35:03] available there. But here you can choose
- [35:05] different regions. Okay. So let's say
- [35:07] Tokyo for example.
- [35:10] So in Tokyo, let's see if I remove it.
- [35:13] Yes, it is available.
- [35:16] And
- [35:18] let's look at Hyderabad here.
- [35:21] So let's remove here. So see Hyderabad
- [35:24] it's coming in 2026 Q3. So this way you
- [35:30] have awareness on which service is
- [35:34] available in what region and you can
- [35:36] make architectural and design decisions
- [35:39] accordingly. But see here you can see
- [35:41] that this particular agent is running.
- [35:45] Okay. You can see like a different you
- [35:48] know like the observability runtime
- [35:49] sessions runtime throttle rate all of
- [35:52] that. Uh you can see all those
- [35:55] observability parameters here. You can
- [35:58] also monitor the logs. So it has
- [36:00] something called log insight. So if you
- [36:03] click on this log insight. Okay let me
- [36:05] open that. And you want to see the logs
- [36:10] which are you know in last few seconds
- [36:12] whatever logs came by you want to see
- [36:14] it. So you will say so let me just do it
- [36:17] in a different way. I will click on view
- [36:19] in logs insights here so that I can see
- [36:21] it easily. Run query and when I run it
- [36:25] see I see those logs. Uh the context the
- [36:28] prompt the payload right now remember we
- [36:32] put that code for the payload. So the
- [36:35] payload is nothing
- [36:37] but in this particular file we had the
- [36:41] print statement received payload and
- [36:44] context. See received payload and
- [36:45] context and that is what you are seeing
- [36:47] here. Received payload payload has just
- [36:50] prompt that's it. And the context has
- [36:55] this session ID and a request header.
- [36:58] Now let me clear this out. Okay. And let
- [37:03] me ask a different question. So I will
- [37:07] say activate it for Dubai. Okay, I asked
- [37:11] question on the roaming. And now I'm
- [37:15] asking a follow-up question. Activate it
- [37:17] for Dubai. See it doesn't have memory.
- [37:19] So it doesn't know the previous
- [37:21] question. So it is just giving general
- [37:22] answer. Activating your service for
- [37:24] Dubai. Let me type in a better question.
- [37:27] I can say which country am I talking
- [37:31] about? It should say UAE right because
- [37:33] Dubai is in UAE but it doesn't have any
- [37:37] memory. So it is saying I'm not sure
- [37:39] which country you are referring to. So
- [37:42] as a next step we will look into the
- [37:44] memory. To set up the memory let's click
- [37:47] on memory option here and click on
- [37:51] create memory. Here you can specify for
- [37:54] how many days you want to keep your
- [37:57] short-term memory. I will say 99 days.
- [38:01] Okay. And you can give some memory name.
- [38:04] You can say that agent core
- [38:07] or let's say customer care agent memory.
- [38:12] And here in the built-in strategies,
- [38:15] there are couple of strategies here. I'm
- [38:17] going to click on the first two which is
- [38:19] summarization. This will summarize
- [38:21] interaction to preserve critical context
- [38:23] and key insights. So this is a strategy
- [38:26] to extract long-term memories from raw
- [38:30] interactions. See as a human also we do
- [38:33] all the raw interactions but our brain
- [38:36] somehow keeps the key points from those
- [38:39] interactions so that we can recall.
- [38:41] Similarly here you are summarizing the
- [38:44] interactions to preserve critical
- [38:46] context and key insights. Okay. So it's
- [38:48] some kind of strategy. Then second one
- [38:52] is semantic memory. So we are going to
- [38:53] click on that too. So this will extract
- [38:55] general factual knowledge, concepts and
- [38:58] meaning from raw conversations. Okay.
- [39:00] Now agent core is a brand new platform.
- [39:03] It is evolving. We are seeing new and
- [39:05] new options being added. So if you see
- [39:07] new options either in memory or anywhere
- [39:10] else, don't be surprised. Okay, they're
- [39:12] making it better and better day by day.
- [39:15] All right. I think built-in strategy
- [39:18] with overhead. Let's say if you want to
- [39:19] add your own strategy for memory
- [39:21] management, you can click on add
- [39:23] strategy here. Okay. And this one is
- [39:27] self-manage. Anyways, for this project,
- [39:29] uh this much setup is enough. And when
- [39:32] you say create memory, see this type of
- [39:35] memory is created. So now when I go to
- [39:40] memory, see here I will see this memory.
- [39:43] It is still creating it. Okay. So here
- [39:47] this is the memory ID. So now in your
- [39:50] agent when you specify this memory ID,
- [39:53] it will use this particular object in
- [39:55] AWS environment to store that memory.
- [39:58] Now folks please open the folder of the
- [40:02] code that I have given to you. Okay? And
- [40:04] in that copy this file agent core
- [40:07] memory. Copy this file to your agent
- [40:10] core tutorial folder. Okay. So I have
- [40:13] copied it. And now I will be able to see
- [40:17] it here.
- [40:20] Now see here in this code I have added
- [40:23] the memory management. So my region I
- [40:26] will say US East one. So update the
- [40:30] region here. Okay. Whatever is the
- [40:32] region for your AWS account you should
- [40:34] have that region here. And also the
- [40:38] memory memory ID. Okay. Copy it from
- [40:40] here and put it here.
- [40:44] So this is your memory ID
- [40:47] and remaining things are as it is. So
- [40:50] what I'm going to do is first uh deploy
- [40:53] this new agent and then I will go over
- [40:56] the code and I will explain you know how
- [40:57] this thing works. So first let's see the
- [41:00] final impact and then I will explain. So
- [41:03] here what we are going to do is now we
- [41:07] will uh use this particular file. Okay,
- [41:10] this particular invocation function from
- [41:12] this new file to build our agent. So
- [41:15] what are the steps? Well, first is agent
- [41:17] core config. Okay, so you will say agent
- [41:20] core config and in that config you will
- [41:25] add the name of this new file which is
- [41:28] 02 aent core memory.py. Okay, so let's
- [41:32] run this. So here you need to give the
- [41:37] agent name. So I will just say inferred
- [41:40] agent name is this. Okay, I'll just keep
- [41:43] it like this. Agent core memory invalid
- [41:46] agent name. Okay, the agent name is
- [41:48] invalid. Okay, it should start with a
- [41:51] letter. So let's call it agent core with
- [41:55] me or just simple right like agent with
- [42:00] memory.
- [42:01] Okay, pi project toml file. In case if
- [42:04] you have a requirement txt file, you can
- [42:06] change it. Okay, you can specify what
- [42:08] file you want to use it as a dependency.
- [42:10] And for container, we are going to use
- [42:12] the dockerbased container environment.
- [42:15] We want it to infer the AR name. ECR
- [42:18] repository is whatever is a default. So
- [42:20] just hit enter. Here you will say no.
- [42:24] Here configure request header no. And
- [42:28] then now this is amazing. See it
- [42:32] detected that you have this memory
- [42:36] object called customer care agent
- [42:38] memory. So simply just hit one. So one
- [42:42] is the ID. Let's say if you have
- [42:44] multiple memory objects, it will show 1
- [42:46] 2 3 etc. And you have to give the ID. So
- [42:48] right now we have just one. So I will
- [42:50] say one. Enter. And now what it did is
- [42:54] it configured this new agent using this
- [42:57] new file. The agent name is agent with
- [42:59] memory. and it used that memory object
- [43:02] that we created in the agent core. Now
- [43:05] the second step is the launch. Okay. So
- [43:09] let me run launch launch and you'll
- [43:12] specify your grog key. Okay. So let's
- [43:15] hit enter here. After some wait my agent
- [43:19] is now ready in my agent core
- [43:21] environment. So if I go to my agent core
- [43:24] page here I will see this. See agent
- [43:28] with memory. It is ready. At this stage,
- [43:30] we can make some invocation. Okay. So,
- [43:33] let's
- [43:34] invoke by asking that basic question.
- [43:36] Tell me about roaming activations.
- [43:40] And see, it fetched that answer. Okay.
- [43:43] Now, I will ask the other question which
- [43:46] is activated for Dubai. And now it
- [43:50] should remember that uh previous
- [43:52] question. See activating roaming for.
- [43:55] See it knows that previously I was
- [43:57] talking about the roaming and here let
- [44:02] me ask one more question which is which
- [44:05] country was I referring to. Now due to
- [44:07] the memory it should know that see
- [44:11] previously you are referring to Dubai
- [44:12] which is United Arab Amirat. All right
- [44:16] look at this. This is so amazing. my uh
- [44:19] agent is now having this memory due to
- [44:22] which it is able to remember the
- [44:24] previous context just like chat GPD. Now
- [44:26] I want to point out few things. See when
- [44:28] we did agent configure with that second
- [44:30] agent if you have noticed our YAML file
- [44:33] in YML file see previously we had this
- [44:36] one agent but now it added this another
- [44:38] agent agent with memory and you can see
- [44:41] all this configuration. So I I encourage
- [44:43] you to look at it so that you can get an
- [44:45] idea on what's happening under the hood.
- [44:48] Now let's look at our code for this
- [44:51] agent core memory. Right? We have not
- [44:53] understood this code yet. So here in
- [44:55] this particular code, this is the main
- [44:58] statement. Okay. When you create an
- [45:00] agent at that time, you can specify the
- [45:02] memory. Now we added these three new
- [45:06] parameters. So checkpointer and store
- [45:09] are basically your short-term memory and
- [45:12] your long-term memory. So checkpointer
- [45:14] is a short-term memory. Short-term
- [45:17] memory means for this session for this
- [45:20] conversation. Okay. If I go to check GPD
- [45:23] and if I start asking all these
- [45:24] questions during that particular
- [45:26] session, it will remember the previous
- [45:29] context. So that is short-term memory
- [45:31] and it is specified by checkpointer.
- [45:34] Long-term memory is something that it
- [45:36] will remember between the threads. So
- [45:39] you might have noticed that you log off
- [45:41] your computer right and after 2 days if
- [45:43] you ask something it would have
- [45:45] remembered uh your personality your way
- [45:48] of asking all of that. So that is
- [45:50] long-term memory and that is something
- [45:51] that you specify using this store
- [45:53] object. Okay. So if you uh look at the
- [45:56] documentation for lang chain okay for
- [46:01] this create agent function here you will
- [46:06] find that the store right the store and
- [46:09] checkpointer so optional checkpointter
- [46:11] saver object used for persisting the
- [46:13] state of the graph for a single thread
- [46:16] meaning single conversation whereas
- [46:18] store is used for multiple conversation
- [46:22] across the threads. Okay, so just to
- [46:24] summarize, this is short-term memory.
- [46:25] This is long-term memory. We also
- [46:27] specified the third argument which is
- [46:31] middleware. Okay, so what exactly is
- [46:33] middleware? So let's look at it. So if
- [46:35] you look at the documentation here, a
- [46:38] sequence of middleware instances to
- [46:40] apply to your agent. And if you look at
- [46:42] the documentation for middleware,
- [46:45] it is essentially a hook, you know, pre
- [46:47] hook and post hook before you make a
- [46:49] call to LLM if you want to add
- [46:51] something. So usually what happens is
- [46:54] the way memory works is you before you
- [46:56] make a call to LLM in your prompt you
- [46:59] will add the previous context and after
- [47:02] the call is made after you get the
- [47:05] response you might want to add the new
- [47:08] question to your memory or you want to
- [47:11] do something related to telemetry right
- [47:13] all of that can be done by middleware
- [47:15] okay so the plain call without middle
- [47:18] aware will look something like this
- [47:19] right request model tools whatever
- [47:22] And with middleware it will look
- [47:24] something like this. See before model
- [47:26] after model. So you are basically having
- [47:29] this hooks. So let me show you what kind
- [47:31] of hooks we have. So first of all let me
- [47:34] show you the checkpointer and store
- [47:35] object. So if you click on checkpointter
- [47:37] see we have imported this classes from
- [47:40] lang graph. Now we have another langraph
- [47:42] video. If you go watch it on our channel
- [47:44] we have talked about checkpointer. So
- [47:46] checkpo pointer is a way to store your
- [47:48] conversation your memory in langraph.
- [47:50] Right. So from lang graph you're
- [47:52] importing agent core memory saver. Agent
- [47:55] core memory store. Memory saver is a
- [47:58] short-term memory. This is a long-term
- [47:59] memory. So we created these two using
- [48:02] the memory ID. Right? Memory ID is
- [48:04] something that we created in our agent
- [48:06] core environment. And then the
- [48:08] middleware. Okay. So let's look at how
- [48:10] we have set up the middleware. See
- [48:12] middleware is nothing but a class. See
- [48:13] if you look at middleware here it is a
- [48:17] class and the class has this pre hook
- [48:20] and post hook. So in prehook what you're
- [48:22] doing is essentially you are getting
- [48:25] this store object in the function right
- [48:27] and if you look at the store object is
- [48:29] derived from base class base store class
- [48:32] and if you look at all these classes
- [48:34] right see this class if you look at it
- [48:37] it is eventually derived from base
- [48:40] store. So you you can trace back uh all
- [48:42] that and you can confirm it. Okay. So
- [48:45] let's go to middleware now. So here from
- [48:48] your store from your memory store right
- [48:51] from your memory store premodel hook. So
- [48:53] in premodel hook see you will first get
- [48:56] the agent state. So in lang graph it's a
- [48:59] graph and you get the state and from
- [49:01] state you are getting the messages and
- [49:04] that message you first put into your
- [49:06] store. Okay. And then save the last
- [49:09] human message to long-term memory
- [49:11] essentially.
- [49:13] And you want to do the search uh in your
- [49:17] store semantic search right retrieve
- [49:19] user preference from long-term memory
- [49:21] search across all the sessions. And
- [49:23] previously whatever question I asked
- [49:25] right do by whatever it will retrieve
- [49:28] that from the store. So these are the
- [49:30] preferences and that you will add to
- [49:33] your memory context so that it knows
- [49:36] that previously I was talking about
- [49:37] Dubai and in the post model hook let's
- [49:40] say you got the response from your uh
- [49:43] LLM and after that if you want to do
- [49:46] something with your response you will do
- [49:48] that. So one thing you want to do is
- [49:49] save the last AI message to your store.
- [49:51] See this is your memory store and you
- [49:53] are saving it here. All right so that
- [49:54] was a quick information on how this
- [49:56] memory class works. We are glad that now
- [49:58] the memory feature is working for our
- [50:00] agent. Let's explore few more features.
- [50:02] We will look at observability. So if you
- [50:05] click here, you will go to the
- [50:08] observability page where you will see
- [50:11] different agents that you have running.
- [50:13] So right now the agents are loading and
- [50:16] it shows me this three agent. So it
- [50:20] shows two agent with memory because I
- [50:23] had created multiple agents with agent
- [50:26] with memory. Okay. To introduce some
- [50:28] error scenarios and you can see some
- [50:29] errors here. Okay. So what you can do is
- [50:34] you can click on this default and go to
- [50:36] the dashboard for that agent. Okay. So
- [50:39] let me go there. This is the new agent
- [50:42] that I created. So if I click on default
- [50:45] here, it will show you all the traces
- [50:48] for that agent. Okay. So if I click on
- [50:50] this, see I made like those three
- [50:53] invocations. Correct? And I can click on
- [50:55] this and it will show me the trace. See
- [50:58] here it says invocation completed
- [50:59] successfully. It will show you the
- [51:01] timing, the breakdown of all the calls.
- [51:04] You can look at the trajectory, right?
- [51:07] See, it will show you the the visual
- [51:09] like graphical representation of all the
- [51:13] calls which were being made. You can
- [51:15] also look at the JSON object here. See,
- [51:17] now once I had an error where I gave a
- [51:20] wrong memory ID. Okay. So I I gave this
- [51:23] and I built that agent and that is the
- [51:25] second agent that you are seeing. Okay.
- [51:29] And that resulted into this error. See
- [51:31] and when you look at the trace
- [51:34] I was able to find out what was the
- [51:36] issue. See resource not found exception
- [51:39] customer see C is missing. So I
- [51:41] purposefully introduced that error and
- [51:43] when I ran that agent you know through
- [51:45] this observability platform I was able
- [51:48] to find the exit error. You can also go
- [51:51] to runtime by the way and look at any
- [51:53] agent and here see you can go to the
- [51:56] logs or dashboard. So let's look at the
- [51:59] dashboard. You will find the same UI
- [52:01] that we have right. So here you have
- [52:03] overview you have sessions. So how many
- [52:06] sessions did we run with that particular
- [52:09] agent. So see here we just had one
- [52:11] session correct? See we have these three
- [52:13] traces. There is this one session. Uh
- [52:16] folks I will encourage you to explore
- [52:19] this. You'll you'll be able to see all
- [52:21] the CPU
- [52:23] consumption, memory consumption. Here it
- [52:26] shows you the KPIs, you know, like
- [52:28] client errors, throttles and so on.
- [52:30] Let's explore a few more features.
- [52:33] Identity is used for authentication. So
- [52:36] for example, you can use oath. Let's say
- [52:38] using your Google credentials or using
- [52:41] your Facebook credentials, you can
- [52:44] authenticate yourself. Okay. So here
- [52:47] there is inbound O. So as you can see in
- [52:49] the picture, let's say you are creating
- [52:51] this uh customer service AI agent. So
- [52:55] the caller will call and it will do the
- [52:58] authentication at this level. And there
- [53:00] is outbound authentication. So the
- [53:03] hosted agent can access some of the
- [53:05] resources in AWS environment. For that
- [53:08] there is this outbound authentication as
- [53:11] well. Then there are built-in tools. So
- [53:13] you know that in agent that we created
- [53:17] we passed the tools which were just
- [53:19] Python function right. So if you look at
- [53:22] our agent here the tools that we used
- [53:25] actually see these were the two tools
- [53:28] and they were customdefined Python
- [53:30] function. But let's say you want to use
- [53:33] a browser. So in that case you can use
- [53:35] this particular built-in tool. So you
- [53:38] can create a browser and you can
- [53:39] configure it. You can also use code
- [53:42] interpreter. In some of the use cases,
- [53:44] you might use code interpreter as one of
- [53:47] your tools. Then we have this agent
- [53:51] sandbox. So let's say you created an
- [53:53] agent and you want to test it. So you
- [53:55] can test it here. So let me copy input
- [53:58] payload here. Right? So this is my agent
- [54:00] with memory. Okay. Endpoint is whatever
- [54:02] is the default. And when I run it here,
- [54:06] you see the response. So in the sandbox
- [54:08] environment if you want to test it uh
- [54:11] this feature becomes pretty handy.
- [54:13] Observability is something we have
- [54:15] looked at it. Evaluation is very
- [54:17] important. These agents are
- [54:19] nondeterministic in nature. They they
- [54:21] are generative. They generate different
- [54:23] answers. So it is very essential that we
- [54:26] use evaluation feature here to evaluate
- [54:29] them. Okay. There's a way to create the
- [54:31] evaluation configuration uh custom
- [54:34] evaluator and view results in agent core
- [54:37] observability. In the agent that we
- [54:39] created, we are using Python functions
- [54:42] as tools. So these are the Python
- [54:44] functions that we define in our
- [54:45] codebase. But sometimes you may want to
- [54:48] use the built-in tools which we already
- [54:51] saw in our agent code platform. These
- [54:53] built-in tools are browser, code
- [54:55] interpreter and so on. And on some other
- [54:57] occasion you might need external tools
- [55:00] such as calling some MCP server or rest
- [55:02] API. So now Python function is something
- [55:06] we already tackled. Built-in tool is
- [55:08] something that agent code platform
- [55:09] provides. But how do you exactly call
- [55:11] MCP server or rest API? For this we have
- [55:15] a feature called gateways. See gateways
- [55:18] they allow you to use external tools
- [55:21] within your agents in a secure way. So
- [55:24] when you create a gateway you can do all
- [55:26] the configuration and you can specify
- [55:28] what is your target whether it's MCP
- [55:30] server it can be a lambda function it
- [55:33] can be rest API okay it can be any of
- [55:36] these four types of target there is also
- [55:38] this option of policy where you can
- [55:41] create a policy engine which is a
- [55:43] collection of policies that will
- [55:45] evaluate and authorize agent tool calls.
- [55:48] Let's assume you have this customer care
- [55:51] AI agent and the person who is smiling
- [55:53] right now is asking for a refund to this
- [55:56] AI agent. Now let's say you have this
- [56:00] rest API. This rest API is called refund
- [56:04] right like or issue refund. So that is
- [56:07] the function call that you have and you
- [56:09] want to create a policy where if the
- [56:12] refund is above certain threshold you
- [56:14] don't want to allow it. In that case in
- [56:17] this policy engine you can put your
- [56:19] policies right you can create like bunch
- [56:20] of policies. One of the policies is that
- [56:23] if the refund amount is greater than
- [56:25] certain threshold right if it is more
- [56:27] than certain threshold then don't allow
- [56:29] it. So this way you can establish
- [56:32] necessary restrictions which are
- [56:34] necessary for your business operation.
- [56:37] As they have mentioned it here, when you
- [56:39] associate it with a gateway, it will
- [56:42] intercept all the agent request and
- [56:45] determines whether to allow or deny
- [56:48] based on the policy. That's it folks.
- [56:50] Now, let's talk about competition. Check
- [56:52] video description. You will find a PDF
