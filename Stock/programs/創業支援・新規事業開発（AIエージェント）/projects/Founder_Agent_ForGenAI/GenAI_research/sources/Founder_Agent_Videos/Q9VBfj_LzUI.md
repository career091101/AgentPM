- [00:03] In this video, we'll talk about
- [00:05] operators. In fact, before this also we
- [00:07] have worked with the operators like
- [00:09] addition, subtraction. But let's see
- [00:11] what else we can do. Now, in this video,
- [00:13] we'll focus on arithmetic operators and
- [00:15] relational operators. There are multiple
- [00:17] options which you can perform. In fact,
- [00:19] with string also or list, we are able to
- [00:22] fetch values. Those are also operations.
- [00:24] But then if we talk about arithmetic and
- [00:26] relational, they are to be different and
- [00:28] we going to see that here. So let's
- [00:30] create two variables here. So I will say
- [00:32] a is equal to 3 and b is equal to two.
- [00:36] Simple variable, simple values. And I
- [00:39] want to perform some operations on them.
- [00:42] So of course I can add these two values,
- [00:44] store it somewhere. But let's say we
- [00:46] don't want to store it anywhere. I can
- [00:47] simply say a + b. Now what we are doing
- [00:50] is we are trying to add these two value.
- [00:53] A which is three, two, b which is two.
- [00:56] And then when you click on enter, you
- [00:58] get the value five. As simple as that.
- [01:00] Now apart from addition, we can also do
- [01:03] other operations like a minus b which is
- [01:05] subtraction. Then a multiplied by b
- [01:07] which is multiplication and a divided by
- [01:11] b which is the division. Okay. So you
- [01:13] can perform all these operations here.
- [01:15] Now we have also talked about double
- [01:17] slash before which will give you the
- [01:19] quotient not the point value. And if you
- [01:21] want to get the remainder, you can use
- [01:23] mod to get the remainder which is one in
- [01:26] this case. So these are the simple
- [01:27] operations which you have. Now what else
- [01:30] we can do? So let's say I want to add a
- [01:33] and I want to increment the value by
- [01:34] two. So the value of a is three at this
- [01:37] case and I want to increment the value
- [01:39] by two. The way you can do that is by
- [01:41] saying a is equal to a + 2. As simple as
- [01:44] that. And of course this will also give
- [01:46] you five. So the current value of a is
- [01:48] five. Makes sense, right? But there's a
- [01:51] trick here. This is the plus operation
- [01:53] or you can say addition. Uh but also we
- [01:56] have used one more operator here which
- [01:57] is equal to, right? Which is the
- [01:59] assignment operator. Now this is not the
- [02:01] first time we are doing this. In in fact
- [02:03] in the first two lines also we are
- [02:05] assigning them right. So three is
- [02:07] assigned to A, two is assigned to B. So
- [02:09] that's your assignment operator. Okay.
- [02:11] But then if you want to perform this
- [02:13] operation where if you can see we are
- [02:15] incrementing A itself. So can't we just
- [02:18] use some shortcuts and yes we do have
- [02:20] shortcuts we can say a plus so we want
- [02:22] to increment a but but how much so if to
- [02:25] say two so we are increment the value of
- [02:28] a by two this is a shortcut also called
- [02:30] assignment operator uh or in some
- [02:33] languages we call shorthand if that
- [02:35] makes sense even this works if you say a
- [02:38] this is seven now so of course a was
- [02:40] five and now we incrementing by two so
- [02:42] this is seven in some languages we also
- [02:46] use a ++ ++ which doesn't work here. You
- [02:48] can see we caught an error. But you can
- [02:51] use this short end and if you if you
- [02:52] want to increment just by one you can
- [02:55] say a + equal to 1 even that works. If
- [02:58] you check the value of a it is eight
- [02:59] now. So let me clear it. So that's how
- [03:01] you can work with the arithmetic
- [03:03] operators and assignment operators. In
- [03:05] fact for assignment this is a fun thing
- [03:07] about Python or amazing thing about
- [03:10] Python is if you want to assign values
- [03:12] to two variables uh let's say X and Y.
- [03:14] Okay. So if I want to x value assign the
- [03:16] value of of six to x I can do like this.
- [03:18] And if I want to assign five to y then I
- [03:20] have to say enter and on the new line I
- [03:22] have to say y equal to 5. Can't we just
- [03:25] assign those values in one line? And
- [03:27] python says yes hold my cup. I should
- [03:29] have said something else but I'm not
- [03:32] sure who is watching this video. So x
- [03:35] comma y or 6a 5. So what we're doing is
- [03:38] we are assigning the value of six to x
- [03:41] and five to y. And if I say enter, let's
- [03:45] check the value of x. Let's check the
- [03:46] value of y. And they have been assigned.
- [03:49] So that's how basically you can work
- [03:50] with the assignment operator. And you
- [03:52] can assign two values. Now if you go
- [03:54] back here, the operation which we have
- [03:55] performed which is a + b, a minus b,
- [03:58] those are called uh this plus minus here
- [04:00] called binary operators. Now why they
- [04:02] are binary is because we got two
- [04:04] operants, right? A and b and we got one
- [04:06] operator. So this one operator working
- [04:08] with two operants. But what if you have
- [04:11] a single operent? In this case we can
- [04:13] let's say the value of a is 8 and I want
- [04:17] to negate it. I want to make it minus.
- [04:20] So you can say minus a. It will minus 8.
- [04:22] Now this operator here which is minus is
- [04:25] applicable only for one operent. So that
- [04:27] is called a unary operator. Okay. Uh but
- [04:30] again the value of a is still 8. It's
- [04:32] just that we are printing it the minus
- [04:34] 8. Uh but if you really want to make it
- [04:36] minus 8 the value of a you can say a
- [04:40] equal to minus a. If that makes sense.
- [04:42] Now a itself becomes minus 8. So that's
- [04:44] the arithmetic and assignment operator.
- [04:47] Let's talk about the relation operators.
- [04:49] Now here let's say I got the value of a
- [04:51] as four and the value of b is let's say
- [04:55] three. So we got two variables and two
- [04:57] values. I can compare them. Okay. Now
- [04:59] when you compare these two values, you
- [05:01] can do that with the help of less than
- [05:02] equal to or less than or greater than
- [05:04] equal to or just less than or just
- [05:06] greater than or not equal to. And when
- [05:09] you do that the result type would be
- [05:12] boolean. And we have talked about
- [05:14] boolean before. Uh let me show you what
- [05:15] I'm talking about. So if I want to check
- [05:17] if a is greater than b and in this case
- [05:19] yes a is greater than b it will return
- [05:21] true. If I say a less than b it will
- [05:24] return false. So this operations results
- [05:26] in a boolean value. Okay. And not just
- [05:29] less than greater than we can also try
- [05:32] you know in maths we do less than equal
- [05:35] to using this symbol. Here we can't we
- [05:37] don't have that symbol on the keyboard.
- [05:39] So we have to say less than equal to B.
- [05:42] And when you say enter it is false. It
- [05:44] is not less than and not not even equal
- [05:46] to. But what I will do is I will just
- [05:47] make the value of B as four. Now A and B
- [05:50] both are four. And if I do the same
- [05:52] operation again it says true. Now it is
- [05:55] not less than but it is equal to. So at
- [05:57] least one of the conditions should be
- [05:58] true. Uh we can also check for A is
- [06:01] greater than equal to B. Now it is not
- [06:03] greater but it is equal to. So it will
- [06:05] return true. So that's how we can work
- [06:07] with the division operators. Also we
- [06:09] have one more. I want to check if
- [06:11] they're not equal to. So or maybe equal
- [06:13] to. So you can say a equal to equal to
- [06:16] b. So it will check if they are equal.
- [06:18] Now why not single equal to? That the
- [06:20] way we do it in maths is because single
- [06:23] equal to is for the assignment. Right?
- [06:25] So if you say this, this is assignment.
- [06:27] And if you want to compare, we have to
- [06:29] use double equal to. And when you say
- [06:31] enter, it returns true. What if you want
- [06:33] to check if they're not equal? In that
- [06:35] case, you have to say not equal B. So
- [06:38] this exclamation means not. And when you
- [06:41] say enter, it says false. It's because
- [06:43] they are same. So that's how we can work
- [06:45] with the arithmetic assignment and
- [06:48] relational operators. Now let's talk
- [06:50] about logical operators. First of all,
- [06:53] why do we need them? So let's go back to
- [06:54] the previous example. We got the value
- [06:57] of A as four and B as four. Okay, both
- [07:00] are same. uh we should have changed it
- [07:02] right so let's make it b as five of
- [07:05] course doesn't matter but so we got two
- [07:07] values now a is four b is five and now I
- [07:10] want to check if a is less than 10 and I
- [07:13] want so of course this will be true and
- [07:16] b is greater than one and this is also
- [07:19] true so both are true makes sense but I
- [07:23] want to combine them okay so I want to
- [07:25] check them in one line so based on these
- [07:27] two values I want to do something you
- [07:29] know so in programming basically ally
- [07:31] when you say your software can think
- [07:32] your computer can think it's because of
- [07:34] these things right where you decide your
- [07:36] path based on what result you get in
- [07:39] terms of true or false example should I
- [07:41] take the umbrella outside when I'm going
- [07:43] it depends upon if it is raining of
- [07:45] course I have to take the umbrella or
- [07:46] maybe it's a rainy season I will take
- [07:47] the umbrella or maybe I'm not even going
- [07:50] to the office I'm going to play cricket
- [07:52] so why do I need an umbrella I want to
- [07:54] enjoy the rain while playing cricket so
- [07:56] these are the conditions which you check
- [07:58] in the same way we got two conditions
- [07:59] here right and I want to combine them.
- [08:01] So maybe it is if it is Sunday and if
- [08:04] I'm not going to office if it is Sunday
- [08:06] and if it is raining doesn't matter I
- [08:08] will not take the umbrella. So I will
- [08:09] take the umbrella only when it is Monday
- [08:11] or weekday and it's a rainy season. So
- [08:15] if the both scenario is true then only I
- [08:17] will take the umbrella. I'm lazy I know.
- [08:20] Uh but here if I how do I combine this?
- [08:22] So the way you do that is very simple.
- [08:24] You just keep that in one line. So first
- [08:27] condition, second condition on the same
- [08:29] line and you say enter and your Python
- [08:31] is not happy. Python says what you
- [08:33] doing? This is not how it works. Uh oh,
- [08:36] maybe it says we don't do that here.
- [08:38] Anyway, so if you want to combine these
- [08:41] two conditions, this is not how you do
- [08:42] it. You have to put something in
- [08:44] between. That's how the syntax works. So
- [08:46] take this take these two conditions and
- [08:48] in between you say and. Okay, like in
- [08:51] English we do that. So this condition
- [08:54] and this condition if both are true
- [08:57] return true as simple as that right? So
- [09:00] that's how you combine two conditions.
- [09:02] If it is that simple, why we are making
- [09:04] the entire video on it? Because there's
- [09:06] a trick. Let's say uh I instead of using
- [09:10] and if I use or because we also use that
- [09:13] in English sometimes we say and sometime
- [09:15] we say or of course we don't use that in
- [09:18] the same place based on different
- [09:19] scenarios we use them but here also it
- [09:21] returns true then which one you should
- [09:23] use that depends upon how and and odd
- [09:25] works. Now first of all if you are
- [09:28] coming from mathematical background you
- [09:29] might have seen this before. There's
- [09:30] something called a truth table. Now see
- [09:32] this condition is true and this
- [09:35] condition is also true. So when you when
- [09:37] you do a and operation on true and true
- [09:40] you get true. This is true and this is
- [09:44] true and when you do odd operation on
- [09:46] true and true you get true. But what
- [09:48] about the other scenarios? Example I
- [09:50] will make this as greater than 10. Now B
- [09:53] is not greater than 10. Okay. And in
- [09:54] this scenario this will return true. But
- [09:57] if you do the same thing with and it
- [10:00] will return false. So yeah things are
- [10:01] different. It's not same because this is
- [10:03] true and this is false. Still still your
- [10:06] or says true. This is true and this is
- [10:10] false and says false. Now to understand
- [10:13] this more we have to look at the truth
- [10:14] table. Now let's look at the truth table
- [10:16] for and first. Now let's say we got two
- [10:18] inputs A and B. Let's not use A and B.
- [10:21] Let's say use something else. So
- [10:22] condition one C1 C2. So we got two
- [10:24] conditions and in these two conditions
- [10:27] both are true then you will get true. We
- [10:29] are talking about and here. So and means
- [10:32] both are true then true. If the first
- [10:33] one is true, second is false, it will be
- [10:35] false. Let's say in the third one, first
- [10:37] one is false, second is true, it will be
- [10:40] false. And if both are false, it will be
- [10:43] false. That's how and works. So only
- [10:46] place where you get the true in the
- [10:47] output is if both are true. On the other
- [10:49] hand, if you talk about or operations,
- [10:51] if both the conditions are true, of
- [10:53] course, you will get true. If one of
- [10:55] them is true also, you will get true. So
- [10:57] let's say true false it is true false
- [10:59] true it is true false false is false so
- [11:02] the only way you will get false is both
- [11:05] should be false example let's use or
- [11:08] here and let's make this both as greater
- [11:11] than 10 then you will get false because
- [11:13] both are false so this is how and or
- [11:15] works but also we got one more which is
- [11:18] not so let's say uh I got result which
- [11:22] is true okay so of course if you print
- [11:25] result it will be true if to say not
- [11:27] result. Of course, you can't use
- [11:29] exclamation here. That's only for the
- [11:31] relational operators. But if you talk
- [11:32] about logical operators, we have to say
- [11:34] not. Now, what not will do is not will
- [11:36] just reverse it. It will say false. So,
- [11:38] result was true. If you say not result,
- [11:40] it is false. It will just reverse the
- [11:43] condition or the output. So, those are
- [11:46] your logical operators. So, that's it
- [11:49] from this video. See you in the next
- [11:50] part.
