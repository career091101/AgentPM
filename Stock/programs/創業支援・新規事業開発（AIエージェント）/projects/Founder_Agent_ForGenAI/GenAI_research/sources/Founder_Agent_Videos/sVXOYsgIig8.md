- [00:00] All
- [00:01] [Music]
- [00:04] [Applause]
- [00:06] [Music]
- [00:11] right, great.
- [00:14] All right, great. Well, um, so I'm here
- [00:17] with with Anch um, from actually how let
- [00:19] me how do I how do I say the company?
- [00:21] Relio.
- [00:21] >> An Canvoir. Realio.
- [00:24] >> An Canar. Relio. Yeah,
- [00:26] >> RTO. Realio is for relationships. You
- [00:28] can remember that way.
- [00:29] >> Oh, cool. Okay. All right. So, we're
- [00:31] here with Anch from Relio. You're the
- [00:34] chief product officer. Is that right?
- [00:36] >> That's right. Se chief product officer
- [00:37] at Relio.
- [00:39] >> Awesome. And um An can you just like
- [00:41] just give a a simple intro into what
- [00:44] Reto does?
- [00:46] >> Yeah. Yeah. Um so, Reto is about data
- [00:49] unification. So, we're able to bring
- [00:52] lots of different firstparty data
- [00:54] together for large enterprises. And you
- [00:57] know, let's let's just start with the
- [00:59] problem that these enterprises are
- [01:00] trying to solve. Yeah. Sometimes it's
- [01:03] hard for the bigger the company, the
- [01:05] harder it is to answer simple questions
- [01:07] like how many customers do we have? It's
- [01:10] actually a fairly complex problem
- [01:12] because products are sold through
- [01:14] different channels. Companies grow
- [01:15] through acquisition. Um companies have
- [01:18] franchisee type of models. There's an
- [01:21] accumulation of systems over the years,
- [01:24] right? Whether that's the different SAS
- [01:25] systems or you know on-prem applications
- [01:28] each one comes with its own sort of
- [01:30] opinionated view of how to manage data.
- [01:33] So at the end of the day it becomes very
- [01:35] hard to answer simple questions and
- [01:36] therefore it becomes hard to run
- [01:39] business operations that are consistent
- [01:41] that are efficient across these
- [01:43] enterprises. Um, and and we've always
- [01:46] believed that the power is in the data
- [01:48] and and I I'm sure as as AI more and
- [01:51] more people get into AI, they're going
- [01:53] to come to the same realization. And so
- [01:56] what Relio solves is data unification
- [01:59] which is the ability to bring together
- [02:02] some of this first party data and apply
- [02:04] a different variety of techniques to
- [02:06] make sure that the output is as
- [02:09] trustworthy
- [02:10] um or or much more trustworthy than the
- [02:13] different inputs that went in. Right? So
- [02:15] this data using abstract terms I'll make
- [02:17] it more real. So this data can be about
- [02:20] your customers, about your suppliers,
- [02:23] about locations, um about products that
- [02:27] your company sells. So think about any
- [02:28] noun, right, that you need to make
- [02:30] higher fidelity. Um so let's take
- [02:33] customers as an example. So you would
- [02:35] you would have um you know in any any
- [02:38] typical enterprise, you would have
- [02:39] customer information in your CRM system.
- [02:42] There's probably a customer success
- [02:44] system somewhere. um there is a shipping
- [02:46] or a warehousing system perhaps an
- [02:48] e-commerce system right even these four
- [02:50] systems they they they have their own
- [02:53] variations of information about Shawn
- [02:56] Burton
- [02:57] >> right
- [02:57] >> there there is no single view that says
- [03:01] Shan Burton authoritatively we can say
- [03:03] is such and such customer ID lives at
- [03:06] such and such address has had such and
- [03:08] such transactions with us um and
- [03:10] therefore be able to that that
- [03:13] information can then be used for
- [03:15] downstream uh consumption and we'll talk
- [03:18] about that in a little bit in different
- [03:19] ways. Um but having that confidence in
- [03:22] the first place that data about Shawn is
- [03:25] really data about Shawn, right? The
- [03:28] completeness of that data is what we
- [03:30] started out as to to to solve for. Um
- [03:33] and that space is what we've grown into
- [03:36] the data unification umbrella.
- [03:38] And so as part of that unification, it
- [03:40] sounds like you're having I mean quality
- [03:42] sounds like a very big part of that
- [03:44] unification is
- [03:45] >> Yeah.
- [03:46] >> Yeah. making sure.
- [03:47] >> Absolutely. Absolutely. Data quality.
- [03:48] But data quality, it's a very
- [03:50] interesting and important thing, right?
- [03:51] You don't solve data quality for the
- [03:53] sake of data quality.
- [03:54] >> Mhm.
- [03:55] >> You create you you improve the quality
- [03:58] of data because you want a certain level
- [04:01] of performance out of a business
- [04:03] process.
- [04:04] >> Mhm. And this has been our approach from
- [04:06] the very beginning that if you start
- [04:08] with the business process, the business
- [04:10] outcome that the enterprise is looking
- [04:12] for and work backwards from there. Then
- [04:14] the data, the shape of that data, the
- [04:16] the the connectivity amongst that data
- [04:20] and the level of quality of that data
- [04:22] can be refined to the point where it's
- [04:24] meeting the business objectives. Yeah,
- [04:27] >> 100%. Yeah. So, so given how long have
- [04:30] you guys been in this space just the
- [04:31] data space in general? company started
- [04:34] in 2011.
- [04:35] >> Okay. So good. So how do you see it? I
- [04:38] mean given that uh sort of AI what what
- [04:41] we see in the conference I should say is
- [04:43] >> we see an tremendous broadening out of
- [04:46] of interest uh over the last really this
- [04:50] this year in particular
- [04:51] >> and how do you think about like how is
- [04:54] it changing for you guys? Because what
- [04:55] we're seeing is companies that didn't
- [04:57] even necessarily really consider
- [04:59] themselves data companies before
- [05:01] >> are all of a sudden looking at the
- [05:03] capabilities of AI saying, "Wait a
- [05:04] second, this can can make use of our
- [05:07] data in ways that we really never
- [05:09] thought about."
- [05:10] >> So, how is that affecting your business
- [05:11] considering you went all the way back to
- [05:13] 2011?
- [05:14] >> No. And and and um it's a tremendous
- [05:18] moment for everybody in the industry.
- [05:21] And what we're seeing is enterprises. I
- [05:24] think the big change in the last year as
- [05:25] as you mentioned is with a genic AI
- [05:28] specifically it's becoming very clear
- [05:31] how AI will percolate through the
- [05:33] enterprise.
- [05:34] >> Right. With generative AI there was
- [05:36] clarity around certain tasks. You know
- [05:38] we talk about translations and
- [05:40] summarizations and content generation
- [05:42] that was fantastic. We knew that would
- [05:44] make its way into the mainstream
- [05:46] especially on the consumer side maybe on
- [05:47] the enterprise side. But with Agentic
- [05:49] it's very very clear that this is about
- [05:52] reduction in toil this is about
- [05:54] automation this is the next iteration of
- [05:57] you if you will of what started off as
- [05:59] you know business process re-engineering
- [06:01] there was an RPA phase there was a
- [06:03] workflows phase right and and this is
- [06:06] really the the ability to do those
- [06:08] things in a manner that is uh that is
- [06:11] not fragile anymore right that is not uh
- [06:13] that is not processoriented but really
- [06:15] it is about um but about bringing
- [06:19] intelligence to the enterprise and
- [06:22] that's never happened before right um
- [06:25] what we're seeing is that customers are
- [06:28] now very quickly they've gone through
- [06:31] the phases of experimentation I I'm sure
- [06:33] you you're hearing a lot about the MIT
- [06:35] report that just came out that said 95%
- [06:38] of our AI projects fail um that that's
- [06:41] an interesting statistic but we don't
- [06:43] see it that way what we're seeing is
- [06:45] that there's a lot of experimentation
- [06:47] Yes, but the conclusions that are coming
- [06:49] out of that experimentation are very
- [06:51] clear. And one of those conclusions is
- [06:54] that trusted AI has to be built on
- [06:57] trusted data because that's the one
- [06:59] missing ingredient if you think about
- [07:01] it. Right? These models are so capable
- [07:03] at this point. They've been trained on
- [07:05] all the world's knowledge except the
- [07:07] specific knowledge in your enterprise.
- [07:10] >> Right.
- [07:10] >> Right. And so that becomes a general
- [07:13] open-ended problem. And there's a race
- [07:15] right now. um to to try to solve that
- [07:18] from from a a software builder
- [07:20] perspective, but also conversely the
- [07:23] race from the enterprises where they see
- [07:25] the potential now and really want to
- [07:28] build into that promise because um what
- [07:32] businesses are solving for are what
- [07:33] they've always solved for, right? It's
- [07:35] either either it's growth or it's risk
- [07:38] management or it's efficiency, right?
- [07:41] Those buckets always stay the same. And
- [07:43] I think this is just a new capability
- [07:45] that at this point enterprises view as
- [07:47] being mature enough given that they can
- [07:50] actually run it off of trusted data.
- [07:55] >> So how uh how long do you think it'll
- [07:57] take everyone to figure out that that's
- [07:59] that's the key?
- [08:01] >> Oh, I I I think this is a long-term
- [08:03] transformation, right? I I I don't I
- [08:06] don't share the the six month to 18month
- [08:09] uh kind of time frame. This is a
- [08:10] generational shift. Um and and it's it's
- [08:14] fundamental, right? It it's I I do feel
- [08:16] it's a one-way door that that we're not
- [08:19] going back on this technology. Um and
- [08:22] the trends from a um you know the the
- [08:26] other angle that is important is this
- [08:28] has to be a commercially viable
- [08:30] solution. So if you look at the cost of
- [08:33] inference for example last three years I
- [08:35] think the cost of inference has come
- [08:36] down 900x.
- [08:38] That's a very positive trend and that
- [08:41] means that we can really take this
- [08:43] intelligence and plug it into our
- [08:46] day-to-day mundane tasks. And I recently
- [08:49] read I think this was a venturebe
- [08:51] article recently which said to be
- [08:53] successful AI needs to mold to
- [08:55] enterprise processes not the other way
- [08:57] around.
- [08:58] >> Right? So there's commercial viability,
- [09:00] there's an under there's there's a
- [09:02] understanding of enterprise process and
- [09:05] there has to be this idea of
- [09:06] psychological safety that within those
- [09:09] processes this intelligence can actually
- [09:12] um supplement um human activity. Uh and
- [09:16] I think there's a lot of fear of
- [09:17] supplanting human activity. I think
- [09:19] that's that's a little premature. And I
- [09:20] think this is a 10-year cycle. Um,
- [09:23] anybody who spent time with cursor can
- [09:25] attest to the fact that it's just not
- [09:28] that smart.
- [09:29] >> Right. Right. It's not. Yes. It's
- [09:31] interesting. We get very excited about
- [09:33] uh
- [09:34] >> the ability to write a, you know, 50line
- [09:36] Python script which which it can do
- [09:38] really fantastically.
- [09:39] >> Absolutely.
- [09:40] >> And then we go to drop a huge project in
- [09:43] that, you know, maybe it's been five or
- [09:44] six years of human coding and wonder why
- [09:47] it's you know having some problems and
- [09:49] >> absolutely.
- [09:50] >> Yeah, you're you're 100% right. And when
- [09:53] we think about agentic AI, I mean, I
- [09:56] think that that's been a problem a for a
- [09:59] long time is getting business owners to
- [10:01] understand sort of the physics, the
- [10:03] underlying physics which you can't
- [10:04] change if and comes back to data, right?
- [10:07] So it's
- [10:08] >> no no absolutely and I think the other
- [10:10] angle to think through as as enterprises
- [10:13] are adopting agents is that it is sort
- [10:16] of it becomes a numbers game in a way.
- [10:18] So
- [10:20] every process that you have encoded
- [10:22] today as a as as as a as part of a SAS
- [10:27] application. So you know something
- [10:29] something as critical as code to cache.
- [10:32] >> That's a process. It lives in a CRM
- [10:34] system today. It just happened that the
- [10:36] CRM system is built off multiple of
- [10:38] those processes packaged together versus
- [10:41] an ERP system has some other processes
- [10:44] that are packaged together. your
- [10:46] customer success system has other
- [10:47] processes that are packaged together.
- [10:49] But what if the goal of agents which I
- [10:53] see evolving is is is to take each one
- [10:56] of these processes and give you an agent
- [10:58] that is the best possible thing for your
- [11:00] enterprise to go solve for that process.
- [11:03] >> Right.
- [11:04] >> Right. Now certainly one agent is
- [11:06] replacing um uh uh uh or or there's
- [11:10] multiple agents that are replacing or
- [11:12] augmenting or or these applications are
- [11:14] morphing into multiple agents and all
- [11:17] these agents are collaborating with each
- [11:19] other as opposed to you know the SAS
- [11:21] world right now is really made up of
- [11:22] these silos of both applications and
- [11:24] data that don't really talk to each
- [11:26] other. It's very hard for them to to
- [11:28] really communicate with each other. And
- [11:30] I think that big transformation is also
- [11:32] something to watch out for because where
- [11:35] you have I think the number Octa
- [11:37] published was 400 odd applications for a
- [11:40] midsize uh midsize enterprise
- [11:43] >> distinct 400 odd applications. Yeah.
- [11:46] >> Right.
- [11:46] >> But um what happens if if the number of
- [11:50] agents let's say there's 10 agents per
- [11:51] application now. Yeah. Now we suddenly
- [11:53] have 4,000 agents.
- [11:55] >> Right.
- [11:56] >> Right. So this order of magnitude
- [11:58] increase you can make these agents at
- [12:00] the highest level you can you can make
- [12:02] them interact with your data in two
- [12:04] modes. One is to solve a problem. The
- [12:07] agent now goes and talks to these
- [12:10] different sources of data. I I sort of
- [12:12] the example I'd used with your record
- [12:14] Sean which is distributed in four
- [12:16] different systems, right?
- [12:17] >> Yeah. um either the agent can go and
- [12:19] assemble these four in um in in in you
- [12:23] know when it needs to produce the output
- [12:25] like a researcher agent does today you
- [12:27] know chat GPT or others
- [12:28] >> um and then it sort of presents an
- [12:30] output to you
- [12:32] >> or you can have all this data
- [12:34] pre-assembled unified in a way that the
- [12:36] agent itself can be real time enabled
- [12:40] >> right
- [12:40] >> right and so what is the practical
- [12:43] utility of it well imagine in the future
- [12:45] you're calling into a call center and
- [12:48] the call center wants to know what was
- [12:50] our last conversation with Shawn. What
- [12:52] was the emotional tenor of that
- [12:54] conversation, right? Was it a was a
- [12:56] happy conversation or was Shawn unhappy
- [12:58] with us for some reason?
- [13:00] >> Well, if it was he was happy and he's
- [13:01] calling in, might be a good moment to
- [13:04] position a product to Shawn. But we want
- [13:07] to position a product only in keeping
- [13:10] with Sean's compl
- [13:13] if if if he has given us the right to to
- [13:16] position products or you know uh share
- [13:19] product placements with us. Number two
- [13:21] is we want to maximize the chance of
- [13:24] placing the right or making the right
- [13:26] sale. Therefore, we want to place the
- [13:28] right product. And so, product um
- [13:31] suggestions that sort of pop up in that
- [13:34] call center are very very important um
- [13:37] in terms of being recent, right? Because
- [13:40] you could have called in in the last
- [13:41] hour and you would have been unhappy.
- [13:43] And if the data that is powering those
- [13:45] suggestions or or that interaction is 3
- [13:47] hours old, well, guess what? They're
- [13:49] going to try to sell you a product that
- [13:50] you're absolutely not interested in. You
- [13:52] are you're calling in to settle a
- [13:53] billing dispute. Right.
- [13:55] >> Right. So, so that those are the kinds
- [13:57] of scenarios. Now, what will happen is
- [14:00] in the future when you're calling into
- [14:01] the call center, it's probably not a
- [14:03] human who's answering your your your
- [14:05] call.
- [14:05] >> Right.
- [14:06] >> Right. So in a way it doesn't matter if
- [14:10] the the the entity responding to you is
- [14:14] a human agent or is a machine agent.
- [14:18] They still need to be powered by data
- [14:20] that is relevant to you and relevant and
- [14:23] upto-date to the minute.
- [14:26] >> So that's kind of our vision for where
- [14:28] we want to go where we are with unified
- [14:30] data today. And I think more and more
- [14:31] enterprises are discovering that that's
- [14:33] the substrate that they need. um across
- [14:36] all of their business operations to
- [14:38] really be able to speed up and deliver
- [14:41] um of of of today's expectations because
- [14:44] the one thing that is unchanging fact is
- [14:46] we are speeding up right because of AI
- [14:48] the expectations are getting getting u u
- [14:51] uh much more uh much higher in terms of
- [14:55] how fast anything can be delivered
- [14:57] really
- [14:57] >> right and I think we're all sort of I
- [15:00] think that we're all waiting for that
- [15:02] day to be honest that that these systems
- [15:05] are intelligent and they are agentic and
- [15:08] they can actually I can call American
- [15:10] Express with a problem or Best Buy
- [15:12] whoever it is and actually get real
- [15:14] solutions because and and it's getting
- [15:16] increasingly frustrating that that's not
- [15:18] there yet in a way because we can we can
- [15:20] touch them with you know chat GPT and
- [15:22] all these different consumer
- [15:23] >> um absolutely these apps so then you go
- [15:25] into these other experiences where
- [15:26] that's not there and it feels very
- [15:28] disappointing right
- [15:29] >> that that's right actually that's one of
- [15:31] the tells um if if you call into um you
- [15:35] know for for support and you get
- [15:37] transferred from department to
- [15:39] department and every time the next
- [15:40] person picks up they're like what are
- [15:42] you calling about
- [15:43] >> right yeah what's your phone number yeah
- [15:45] >> yeah and and and that that you know the
- [15:47] way we view that is is this it's about
- [15:49] shared context right we talk about data
- [15:52] and we talk about unific unified data
- [15:54] all day long from an AI perspective
- [15:56] though it is about shared context right
- [15:59] how do we create this shared context
- [16:02] make it available in native
- [16:04] terms, native language that language
- [16:07] models understand and I'll explain that
- [16:09] in a second. Um, and then be able to
- [16:11] update that in near real time, right?
- [16:14] So, it we use this term called data at
- [16:16] rest versus data in motion. That's
- [16:18] really what we mean. Uh, because this
- [16:20] shared context, you know, it exists
- [16:23] within Realio, for example, as a graph,
- [16:26] right? So
- [16:27] >> languages uh sorry large language models
- [16:29] they understand these graphs
- [16:31] intrinsically because the graphs encode
- [16:33] relationships.
- [16:34] >> So it's so much easier for them to
- [16:36] understand that um you know a customer
- [16:39] is related to certain products because
- [16:42] the customer bought those products in
- [16:44] the past and because they bought certain
- [16:46] products they have a certain propensity
- [16:48] towards a certain kind of product and
- [16:51] therefore placing a product with a
- [16:53] higher probability than if you did not
- [16:55] have the relationships. if you just
- [16:56] simply had tables that were listing
- [16:58] products. Right.
- [16:59] >> Right.
- [17:00] >> So, um that that is what we mean
- [17:02] specifically by shared context. Um and
- [17:05] then updating of that shared context
- [17:07] means that when uh you know these sort
- [17:09] of collaborating agents when we pass
- [17:11] these calls from you know customer
- [17:13] success agent to a sales agent again whe
- [17:16] regardless of whether it's human or or a
- [17:17] machine agent
- [17:19] >> that context sort of seamlessly is
- [17:20] available to each one of them right
- [17:23] >> makes a lot makes a ton of sense. I'm
- [17:25] I'm excited to get to this place.
- [17:28] >> We're building it, right? We're all
- [17:30] building.
- [17:30] >> We are building. Yeah, it's going to get
- [17:31] there and life's going to be a lot, you
- [17:34] know, a lot better for everybody when
- [17:35] they get to do these things. So,
- [17:38] >> absolutely.
- [17:38] >> What sort of stuff are you going to be
- [17:39] talking about uh at the conference?
- [17:42] >> Well, um I I want So, I wanted to know
- [17:45] actually, Don, so who's who's in the
- [17:47] audience? Are these are these mostly
- [17:49] builders um executives? Like, give give
- [17:51] me an idea about the makeup.
- [17:53] >> Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So, so it's it's
- [17:56] changing a lot this year. Uh, we
- [17:57] actually have a real-time analytics
- [17:59] system that is, you know, computing all
- [18:02] this type of stuff, looking at names and
- [18:03] titles and companies, all that kind of
- [18:04] stuff.
- [18:05] >> But, uh, it's evolved quite a bit. We
- [18:07] have a very technical core. So, 2023, it
- [18:10] was literally just researchers and
- [18:11] engineers. That that's it.
- [18:12] >> Okay. Y
- [18:14] >> from the speaker perspective and the
- [18:16] attendees.
- [18:17] >> Uh, 2024, we we saw it broaden out quite
- [18:20] a bit in terms of attendees all of a
- [18:22] sudden. Um so we added a strategy track.
- [18:25] There's a lot of you know interest in
- [18:26] things like governance and
- [18:28] >> you know regulatory and just
- [18:30] transformation. How's this all going to
- [18:31] work?
- [18:32] >> Um and then uh this year we've we've we
- [18:35] saw a new elevation or new broadening
- [18:37] out of uh of the audience again. And so
- [18:40] where we are today is we we still have a
- [18:43] very technical core. So it's coming in
- [18:45] right around 50% a little under 50% are
- [18:48] technical of some sort. And that that's
- [18:51] uh like 28% of them are you know
- [18:53] somebody that works every day and it
- [18:55] could be the title could be software
- [18:56] engineer or AI engineer whatever it is.
- [18:58] >> Y
- [18:59] >> um and then the the the delta there is
- [19:02] you know technical management VPs of
- [19:04] engineering CTOs those type of folks
- [19:07] >> but still have that very technical core
- [19:10] and
- [19:10] >> now it's starting to branch out into a
- [19:13] lot just a lot of a lot of leadership a
- [19:15] lot of leadership across the board. So
- [19:17] we see
- [19:18] >> large companies I mean you know Oracle's
- [19:20] bringing
- [19:21] >> you know Oracle's bringing 25 of their
- [19:23] people plus 25 CEOs of of their
- [19:25] customers for example
- [19:27] >> um and these are these are you know
- [19:29] these are companies that are large
- [19:30] enough to be Oracle's customers so you
- [19:32] know they're
- [19:33] >> they're fast growing big companies or
- [19:35] becoming big companies and we're seeing
- [19:38] you know that that so you have that
- [19:40] technical core we're seeing that other
- [19:42] 50% really broaden out into I mean we've
- [19:45] got an HVAC company that has you
- [19:47] 40 or 50 offices and and this is what I
- [19:49] meant earlier by I think and this is
- [19:51] just a gut feeling but I think there are
- [19:53] these companies that all of a sudden I I
- [19:55] just don't know how much they really
- [19:56] considered themselves to be even be data
- [19:58] companies
- [19:59] >> right
- [19:59] >> three or four or five years ago they
- [20:01] knew they had data but there wasn't some
- [20:03] cohesive thing that you know could maybe
- [20:05] make sense of all of it and
- [20:06] >> right
- [20:07] >> out you know without hiring McKenzie
- [20:08] could
- [20:09] >> you know give them some insights right
- [20:12] >> so we're seeing this nice broadening out
- [20:14] and then you know when you look at our
- [20:16] tracks
- [20:17] Um, we've got we've got that applied AI
- [20:20] track which is really about war stories.
- [20:22] It's sort of like, hey, we implemented
- [20:23] this thing here
- [20:25] >> and here's what happened. And that
- [20:26] that's why it's new for this year
- [20:27] because we did see a lot of
- [20:28] >> that's a fantastic way to
- [20:30] >> a lot of change in um
- [20:32] >> in speaker uh speaker proposals and
- [20:34] things like that.
- [20:36] >> And then uh our frontiers track which is
- [20:38] sort of like very forwardlooking and
- [20:40] what's going to happen in the next sort
- [20:41] of six months to a year. Mhm.
- [20:44] >> Um, and that's that's a that's that's
- [20:46] our biggest track. It's our biggest
- [20:48] stage.
- [20:49] >> And it is it is pretty broad in general.
- [20:52] Like that that's why it's such a, you
- [20:53] know, it's a big room.
- [20:55] >> And then developers is, you know, just
- [20:57] just what it sounds like. So we have,
- [20:58] you know, the dedicated developer track
- [21:00] and a dedicated strategy track where you
- [21:02] kind of like pair off. So So it's a good
- [21:04] mix. But that's kind of like the the
- [21:06] quick overview.
- [21:07] >> Got it. No, that that's super helpful
- [21:09] because then I can sort of tune what
- [21:10] what I'm going to talk about. But in
- [21:12] general, my plan is to um connect the
- [21:18] connect data and AI together in real
- [21:20] terms, right? And when people talk about
- [21:22] data and AI, um at least for the last 3
- [21:25] four years, a lot of the conversation
- [21:27] has been about getting data ready to be
- [21:30] able to build models or train models.
- [21:32] Yeah.
- [21:32] >> Right. Right.
- [21:33] >> As AI comes into the enterprise, it's
- [21:36] going to be very very inferenceheavy,
- [21:40] right? It's going to be about how can we
- [21:43] get maximum leverage out of these models
- [21:46] and inevitably these models will then be
- [21:48] acting on data which is specific to the
- [21:51] enterprise in order to produce viable
- [21:54] awesome results. Right. Right.
- [21:56] >> And so there's a there's a natural
- [21:58] friction there where
- [22:00] there there's a lot of data science and
- [22:02] thinking that has gone into organizing
- [22:04] data to train the models. But now on the
- [22:08] other side consuming this inference
- [22:10] seems like a tant tantalizingly
- [22:14] uh closed goal but again MIT says 95% of
- [22:19] these pilots fail right so what is that
- [22:23] gap right we we can see it we can smell
- [22:25] it it's like you know you know how it
- [22:27] goes it's it's it's a seeing distance
- [22:29] smelling distance spitting distance
- [22:32] >> right so it feels like we're within
- [22:34] smelling distance of this
- [22:36] uh this promise of agentic AI, but how
- [22:40] do we actually get there at the highest
- [22:42] level? That's really what what I want to
- [22:44] talk about. Um there there there's going
- [22:46] to be some talk about burgers. I promise
- [22:48] you.
- [22:49] >> Um you know, uh before a burger is a
- [22:52] burger, it is data.
- [22:54] >> Yeah,
- [22:55] >> I'm going to bring that into the
- [22:56] conversation. um and and really talk in
- [22:59] um because in a way it's also very it's
- [23:03] a technical change but it's a very
- [23:04] deeply human change that is coming right
- [23:08] >> because we feel threatened by this
- [23:11] technology because we feel it is like
- [23:13] us.
- [23:14] >> Yes. And at the same time, we have very
- [23:17] superhuman expectations of this little
- [23:19] piece of technology, right? Yes, we saw
- [23:21] that with self-driving cars. Um that
- [23:25] because it is AI, because it it it has
- [23:28] it has um sort of shades of being
- [23:31] intelligent, we assume that it is
- [23:33] intelligent and then attribute a lot of
- [23:35] things to it, which it is not, right?
- [23:37] Yeah.
- [23:37] >> And so um so so my talk is really going
- [23:41] to be about to the builders really how
- [23:44] can they confidently build given all of
- [23:47] this variety of expectations and push
- [23:50] and pull and historical or or at least
- [23:52] short-term failures of of adoption of AI
- [23:55] in the enterprise? How can they be
- [23:57] successful? That that's really if I can
- [23:59] get that message across in a few
- [24:01] minutes. I'd love for that outcome.
- [24:03] >> Perfect. Now, I think that's so that's
- [24:05] that's that sounds like, you know, it
- [24:07] can be a frontiers style talk because
- [24:10] that's what we're seeing with with the
- [24:12] broadening out is that people are coming
- [24:13] here to try to understand exactly that.
- [24:15] They're trying to understand what is the
- [24:17] solution and a lot of people that's
- [24:19] that's really what's changed. There's a
- [24:20] lot of
- [24:21] >> uh even if it's just you know a few
- [24:23] people within the company but or or the
- [24:25] leadership itself they've experimented a
- [24:28] bit and
- [24:29] >> oftentimes have been disappointed right
- [24:31] because we like you said the expectation
- [24:33] is well I just plug this in and now
- [24:35] we're done.
- [24:36] >> Of course it never really works like
- [24:37] that.
- [24:38] >> Yeah. But we're finally at the point
- [24:40] where, you know, we have this such a
- [24:41] powerful engine now to understand all
- [24:44] these things, right?
- [24:45] >> Absolutely. Absolutely. We just got to
- [24:46] build the cloud around it, you know.
- [24:48] >> Yep. Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. I love
- [24:51] that. That's uh that's super cool. So, I
- [24:53] think you guys when when when you when I
- [24:55] first talked to your team, I I I got
- [24:57] pretty excited about about it because,
- [24:59] you know, that that's my history, too,
- [25:01] is
- [25:02] >> I did a
- [25:03] >> before this I did a you know AI for HR
- [25:06] tech startup.
- [25:07] >> Okay. And ré data is some of the most
- [25:10] horrible data you'll ever see in
- [25:11] >> of course yeah
- [25:12] >> ré datab bases right where you have all
- [25:15] those things you've said right there's
- [25:16] >> there's not just four shons there's 15
- [25:18] shons you know that's right five copies
- [25:21] that
- [25:22] >> and it's just interesting and so
- [25:23] slogging through that data munching
- [25:25] problem
- [25:26] >> and and and it's unstructured data which
- [25:28] is which has been anathema to to data
- [25:31] systems so far right but all that is
- [25:33] changing with this and how do we how do
- [25:36] we unlock the treasure trove drove in in
- [25:38] all of that data. Absolutely. Part of
- [25:40] the equation. Yeah.
- [25:42] >> Yeah. I think that's like super relevant
- [25:44] um super relevant stuff for the concert
- [25:46] conference and you like I said the
- [25:48] attendees are there to whether they're
- [25:50] engineers or or leadership.
- [25:52] >> They're really there to figure this out
- [25:53] from people that are that are soaking in
- [25:55] it every day which
- [25:57] >> super. I'm really looking forward to the
- [25:59] conference. I I'll try to stay for as
- [26:01] much of the event as I can. Normally I'm
- [26:03] in, you know, do the talk out, but I'm
- [26:06] so interested in in everything that
- [26:08] everybody has to say. It's it's amazing.
- [26:10] And thank you, Sean, for actually
- [26:11] putting it together, right? It's uh
- [26:13] >> Oh, yeah.
- [26:13] >> Um it's it's going to be it's going to
- [26:15] be a great event. Looking forward to it.
- [26:17] >> My pleasure. And yeah, thanks for thanks
- [26:19] for taking time to chat with us today
- [26:21] and
- [26:22] >> really looking forward to your talk, An.
- [26:23] And you know, thanks again for
- [26:24] supporting the conference.
- [26:26] >> Yeah, go. This is awesome.
- [26:29] >> Bye.
- [26:29] >> All right. Thanks.
- [26:31] And we figure out how to stop this
- [26:34] recording.
