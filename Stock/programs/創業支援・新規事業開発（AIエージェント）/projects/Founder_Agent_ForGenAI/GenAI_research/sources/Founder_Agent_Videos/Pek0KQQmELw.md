- [00:00] I've been using a lot of new AI agents this 
year and I got a really cool one for you in
- [00:04] this video. It's called Hailuo AI agent and it's 
from a company called Minimax who I partnered
- [00:09] with for this video to show you exactly how 
it works. Now what makes this different and
- [00:14] unique is they're building it as a media agent. 
So basically a all-in-one agent for all media,
- [00:20] images, video, audio, it's going to be all 
in one place. So with a simple chat you could
- [00:26] instantly generate high quality images. Then you 
could expand it in their infinite canvas and you
- [00:32] could keep building out your ideas right on 
that canvas. And the nice part is it comes
- [00:36] with bunch of the best models available right 
now for the image creation part. For example,
- [00:41] including one from Google called Nano Banana. That 
one is ready for you to test and use right now,
- [00:47] too. And then with a quick follow-up prompt, you 
could turn any of those images into a video, too.
- [00:51] Okay, let's dive in. And I'll put a link in the 
description to Hailuo AI here. I'm going to start
- [00:55] right here in the agent section. The first thing 
I'm going to show you is this chat to create. So I
- [01:00] just type in my prompt here and the agent is going 
to bring this to life using the top models. You
- [01:06] can actually if you want change the image models. 
Now in this case I'm going to start with an image
- [01:10] because I actually want to show you what you could 
do with images and then turn them into a video.
- [01:16] It gives you a lot of flexibility that way. So 
I'm going to choose Nano Banana here for image
- [01:20] and Hulu 2 is going to be our video model. So let 
me go ahead and generate this image first. Okay,
- [01:25] I got my image here and it turned out really 
good. It followed my prompt exactly right. I
- [01:29] got the reflective surface. The lighting is 
exactly how I want it to be. And by the way,
- [01:33] I worked as a director and cinematographer 
for high-end commercials for 15 years. So,
- [01:38] this is right up my alley here. Now, right 
here, this is an infinite canvas. So,
- [01:43] I could keep building on this. And I want to show 
you what makes this really unique. So, on the left
- [01:48] side of this, I want to actually add the package 
with some branding. Now, the way I could do this
- [01:54] is if I click on this image, I could press right 
here, add to chat. Now, I'm just going to say add
- [01:59] image of the packaging box on the same perfume 
branding again, soft lighting. Okay, so I got the
- [02:05] packaging now. Now, I'm going to keep adding to 
this and I'll show you how it all comes together
- [02:09] in a second. I'm going to add this one to chat. 
And this way, we'll follow kind of the layout
- [02:14] and the aesthetics of this previous design. Okay, 
now it's zoomed out, but it's kept everything very
- [02:20] consistent with this image, but it's added the 
makeup in the background that I asked for. Now,
- [02:25] I'm going to actually ask for adding some sparkles 
in the air with some soft lighting. And again,
- [02:30] I'm going to add this image. So, it will add it 
to the image. If I don't add it to the image,
- [02:35] it will actually create an image by itself, which 
is sometimes fine because I'll show you when you
- [02:40] combine all this what you could create. But the 
whole point is to keep this consistent throughout.
- [02:45] This bottle is exactly the bottle on the box and 
the box is exactly the same box here just with
- [02:51] additional background items. Okay, so our scene is 
coming together. Let me actually change the order
- [02:55] of this. So we created the bottle, then the box, 
then we created the scene here and we added some
- [03:01] sparkles. Now you could actually individually edit 
these two. So if you press chat down here, instead
- [03:06] of adding it down to the right side, you could 
ask for a change here. So I'm going to say add lux
- [03:12] text. Okay, so now we got a bottle. I could bring 
it over here. And I could still leave this one
- [03:18] because sometimes I may want to create something 
new without the branding or with the branding.
- [03:23] So I could actually keep both here on my canvas. 
Okay. So now what I could do is I could actually
- [03:29] select any one of these and I could say by adding 
it to chat to put it for example on a billboard or
- [03:36] a cover of a magazine. So I'll add this to a cover 
of a magazine called Fashion Today. Okay, perfect.
- [03:43] We got this right here. So, I'm going to put it 
here on the second row. And this infinite canvas
- [03:47] lets you keep building it. So, I didn't create one 
static shot. I'm basically building out an entire
- [03:52] product ad scene, right? I have all the individual 
product shots here. And I could combine them into
- [03:57] different scenes like this. And I could also turn 
them into a video, which I will show you with
- [04:01] the next example here. Now, we're going to level 
this up for the next example. I'm going to create
- [04:06] several individual images and use them to create 
entire scenes. And I'll also keep everything
- [04:12] consistent so I could turn it into a video with 
the agent with one simple prompt. I'm going
- [04:18] to create six different images. The first one is 
going to be the character. And this is what I got.
- [04:21] This is a realistic portrait photo of a futuristic 
woman with short premium blonde hair. So the next
- [04:27] one I want to give her some accessories so I 
could mix and match what she ends up looking
- [04:31] like. So this is going to be a high resolution 
product photo of a futuristic visor. So the next
- [04:36] one was a futuristic motorcycle and I kept it 
in that metallic silver so it matches the whole
- [04:41] scene. Now here's a high-tech silver coat here 
that I created next. So I also created these boots
- [04:47] here. So again, silver and that blue tint. Now 
here's where it comes together. Okay, I have all
- [04:53] my pieces ready and I could create new scenes but 
keep these consistent characters and accessories
- [04:59] throughout everything. So for example, I'm going 
to select this one and add it to chat. I'm going
- [05:04] to select the bike and add it to chat. And I won't 
use the coat, so it uses the regular outfit she's
- [05:10] wearing, but I will add the boots here. And then 
I'll follow up with this prompt. So I ask it to
- [05:16] generate a photo of the subject standing next to 
the bike here. Okay? And I describe the camera
- [05:21] angle that I want. And I describe how I want the 
subject to be positioned. And I said, I don't want
- [05:26] any text here because you can obviously, like the 
previous example, add text here to make this more
- [05:32] of a commercial product. And here's the result. We 
got the exact same character, the exact same bike,
- [05:36] and we got the boots, but she's wearing the 
outfit. Now, I'll show you one more. I created
- [05:42] a new jacket here, so we could actually add that 
to chat and use a different prompt here and put
- [05:47] her in a different position wearing a different 
outfit. Okay, now this time I didn't choose the
- [05:52] boots. So, it's using the boots from the original 
outfit, but the coat I selected, the character
- [05:57] I selected, and the bike I selected. So, you can 
mix and match ton of different options here. Now,
- [06:02] here's another example. Character with the boot, 
with the bike, but this time I changed the prompt
- [06:07] to have her sit on the bike. Now, with any of 
these, you could always click on chat here and
- [06:11] make a small alteration. So, instead of the 
bike facing right, I could have it face left
- [06:17] here and just keep all these in my canvas. 
But you have your base here. So, you could
- [06:22] just make all kinds of different variations. And 
now you could actually bring it to life. So, I'm
- [06:28] going to go ahead and send this to my chat, and my 
follow-up prompt is going to be really simple. I'm
- [06:33] just going to say, "Create a dynamic video of the 
character getting on the bike and riding away."
- [06:41] Okay. Next, I want to show you a real practical 
commercial example, and this could be a fast
- [06:45] and consistent way to create all kinds of 
different dynamic ads or social media post. So,
- [06:50] first I'm going to generate everything. So, 
we have everything for our base. So, first
- [06:56] I'll create my character. We'll go ahead and mix 
and match everything with different outfits. So,
- [07:00] this one is our model, realistic studio photo of 
a confident male standing in a clean white space.
- [07:07] Now, I usually like to start with this clean white 
space because then with a follow-up prompt or with
- [07:12] the chat, I could actually change them and put 
them in any background I want. And I usually
- [07:18] have them wear something like this. That's the 
basic minimal black clothing. And then obviously
- [07:23] I could have a bunch of different outfits that 
they could change out to. Now the next one is
- [07:27] a button-up shirt here I created. The next prompt 
was to create these shoes. Then I created pants,
- [07:32] coats, watch. Okay, so that becomes our base 
and obviously infinite canvas. So you could
- [07:38] have ton of different variations of outfits 
and things like that. And now I'm going to
- [07:42] do some mix and matching to get all kinds of 
different ads and posts. Now for this next one,
- [07:48] I used four different pieces. the model, the coat, 
the pants, and the shoes. And I just said put him
- [07:55] in front of a magazine called Next Level. Now, I 
just used chat here to remove all the text. So,
- [08:00] now I have the exact same character, but with 
the outfit that I want him in, but again,
- [08:05] in that neutral environment. Okay, the next 
one here, I used the watch, I used the code.
- [08:10] I created a new gray shirt and I used our model 
here and I put him on a billboard this time.
- [08:16] Now the nice thing about this is you could see 
based on our references I could in a matter of
- [08:22] minutes create bunch of different posts right 
for social media and for ads and I could keep
- [08:28] using the same outfit same consistent characters 
and then recreating new ones if I need new things
- [08:33] on my infinite canvas. Now, selecting the subject 
and only the watch, I could create individual ads
- [08:39] for individual products here. Again, using the 
same five, six different images that I started
- [08:44] with. And I could pretty much put this model 
in all kinds of different environments and get
- [08:49] all kinds of different social posts like the ones 
you're seeing here. And what I like about this is
- [08:53] how fast I could actually explore and come up with 
new ideas. Now, normally I bounce around between
- [08:58] MidJourney, Photoshop to add text, sometimes 
After Effects or Premiere to give it some motion,
- [09:03] but now you could do that all in one place. And 
if you want to try Hailuo AI agents, I'll leave
- [09:08] the link in the description. They're running a 
special right now. So, make sure you check it out
- [09:12] while it's still active. And I'll be testing more 
of these as they roll out audio next. Right now,
- [09:17] you could do this image with Infinite Canvas. 
You could turn them into video. And now they're
- [09:21] going to roll out audio. So, it's going to 
be a all-in-one platform. So, make sure you
- [09:25] subscribe for that video when I have that ready. 
Thanks again for MiniMax for sponsoring this one.
