- [00:02] there's some new workflow that is
- [00:04] enabled by Cloud 3.7 that many people
- [00:07] didn't know yet with just one single
- [00:09] prompt you can get Cloud to design the
- [00:10] whole application's UI which you can
- [00:13] turn into a fully functional beautiful
- [00:15] application with nice UI and this is a
- [00:18] workflow I want to share with you today
- [00:20] so Cloud 3.7 has been released for a few
- [00:22] weeks and one of the key Improvement is
- [00:25] cloud 3.7 it's just insane about UI
- [00:28] implementations you can just give it a
- [00:30] random Mo complex and you'll be able to
- [00:32] turn into beautiful high quality UI like
- [00:34] that and this enables some of a new AI
- [00:36] coding workflow that is extremely
- [00:38] helpful and one my favorite is this
- [00:40] two-step process that can making sure
- [00:42] the UI output from cloud 3.7 is much
- [00:45] better than normal ones you would have
- [00:46] out of box and this is really huge
- [00:48] because AI coding agents like cursor and
- [00:50] Winger hasn't been really great at
- [00:53] creating UI if you want application to
- [00:55] looks really good the state of art
- [00:57] method is using existing UI component Li
- [01:00] like sh CN DC UI and a few others but if
- [01:03] you wanted to build something really
- [01:05] customized it normally will struggle but
- [01:07] as a model capabili became stronger now
- [01:09] it's the first time I feel like it can
- [01:11] produce high quality customer UI so I
- [01:13] will take you through step by step what
- [01:15] my process look like and how can you
- [01:17] replicate something similar for your own
- [01:20] dream apps but before we dive into that
- [01:22] cloud has been a real killer not only
- [01:24] for UI generation but also many other
- [01:27] day-to-day automations they release ton
- [01:29] of interesting features from projects
- [01:31] Integrations artifacts as well as the
- [01:33] latest analysis tool and sometimes even
- [01:36] I feel like I'm not catching up with all
- [01:37] the features that they have been
- [01:39] released so I'm always curious how does
- [01:41] other top AI experts fully unleash the
- [01:43] potential of those Cloud capabilities
- [01:46] that's why I want to introduce you to
- [01:47] this free ebook complete guide to Cloud
- [01:50] AI made by hopspot CMO Kip and VP
- [01:52] marketing Kieran if you don't know who
- [01:54] Kieran is he has been in AI for a long
- [01:56] time and Shar lots of good insights and
- [01:59] practical workflow for utilizing AI to
- [02:01] automate work and they talks through how
- [02:03] hops spall content team is utilizing
- [02:05] Cloud features like pures artifacts
- [02:08] analysis tool into their workflow as
- [02:10] well as specific prompts that got them
- [02:12] high quality results versus bad ones and
- [02:14] they showcase some of really interesting
- [02:16] use case for example they talk us
- [02:18] through how did they upload the whole
- [02:19] quarters marketing result CSV to cloud
- [02:22] and ask it to generate interactive
- [02:24] dashboard so that senior leaderships can
- [02:26] just come and dig into Data themselves
- [02:28] in my favorite section is where they
- [02:30] demonstrate a Content optimization
- [02:33] system that they build upon cloud from
- [02:35] how they go from SEO enhancement to
- [02:37] cross Channel adoption performance
- [02:39] tracking and content repurposing so I
- [02:41] highly recommend you take a look at this
- [02:43] to either discover all the tricks and
- [02:45] tips or a sneak peck of how top AI
- [02:48] experts are Implement those AI workflow
- [02:50] in Cloud so that it might Inspire some
- [02:52] new business ideas for you I have put a
- [02:54] link in the description below for you to
- [02:56] download this ebook for free and now
- [02:58] let's get back to how can we get get
- [03:00] Cloud 3.7 to build application that has
- [03:02] beautiful UI so I'm going to open cursor
- [03:04] and give it prompt UI senior front end
- [03:06] developers and specify very specific
- [03:09] design style that I want and this prompt
- [03:11] I have tested and works pretty well as
- [03:13] well as some technical specifications
- [03:15] like each page should be in this
- [03:16] specific size and icons which should use
- [03:18] online Vector icon Library the image
- [03:20] must be sourced from open source image
- [03:23] websites the sty should be telling and
- [03:24] never give it task this AI caty
- [03:27] calculator app where users can take a
- [03:28] picture of food and Auto extract
- [03:30] nutrition and similat the prodct
- [03:32] manager's detail functional and
- [03:34] information architecture design follow
- [03:36] the design style and technical
- [03:38] specifications to generate a a complete
- [03:40] UI design plan and create ui. HTML file
- [03:44] that contain all the pages that display
- [03:45] in a horizontal layout and generate the
- [03:48] first two pages first so with just
- [03:51] prompt itself it can already generate
- [03:53] really gorgeous UI outbox with
- [03:55] interaction animation as well but what
- [03:57] you can also do is give it some image
- [04:00] reference example in our case I can just
- [04:02] take a screenshot of the Cal AI app and
- [04:05] come back to cursor paste this image and
- [04:07] click Send great so if we open this you
- [04:10] can see that this UI looks pretty
- [04:12] awesome very likely you might need to
- [04:14] try a few different times uh like for me
- [04:16] I tried actually a few different times
- [04:18] each time some I didn't look right and I
- [04:21] would either just ask it to run again or
- [04:23] give some promp to adjust a style but if
- [04:25] you want to make some a specific
- [04:26] adjustment I can also take screenshot of
- [04:28] this part
- [04:30] and come back saying the 1250 calories
- [04:33] left Tex is not vertically Center align
- [04:35] help me fix it and make it look more
- [04:39] balanced cool and you can see it made
- [04:41] some updates and now it looks more
- [04:44] balanced for the tax above same thing
- [04:46] we're also going to update the next page
- [04:48] as well so I'll just come back and take
- [04:50] a screenshot of the original mup and the
- [04:53] past in help me update the second screen
- [04:57] based on the mo up so
- [05:02] great now you can see that this two page
- [05:04] all looks pretty decent and awesome so I
- [05:06] can just tell it great UI looks awesome
- [05:08] don't change UI just add some
- [05:10] interaction
- [05:12] animations and now it will have some
- [05:14] kind of hover interactions when you
- [05:16] hover those buttons which looks pretty
- [05:18] nice once it's done I can also ask you
- [05:20] to continue with more pages great those
- [05:23] two pages looks awesome keep the same
- [05:24] quality and continue creating more pages
- [05:26] of the
- [05:28] app and I just do the same thing updated
- [05:31] page or page uh like this one the
- [05:33] spacing looks a bit off and I will take
- [05:35] a screenshot and tell it the spacing
- [05:37] looks a bit off Place update cool so
- [05:40] after a few prompts I got this UI that
- [05:42] looks pretty awesome and you can obvious
- [05:44] continue going to create more page and
- [05:46] Flash out the whole application but now
- [05:48] it is still just a static page how can
- [05:50] we turn this into a proper web app so
- [05:53] what I'll do here is that I will give a
- [05:54] prompt if I want to turn this into a
- [05:56] proper nextjs web app what UI components
- [05:59] should I create don't generate files yet
- [06:02] just think and plan for now and just
- [06:04] focus on minimum amount of UI
- [06:06] components and here you go it start
- [06:08] defining the list of components and this
- [06:11] step is actually pretty critical I found
- [06:12] when I ask it to just go create app it
- [06:15] often failed to replicate a similar UI
- [06:18] but once you ask it to break down
- [06:19] specific components then it becomes a
- [06:22] bit easier for them and next what I do
- [06:24] is I will try to set up a project and
- [06:26] I'm just going to use chass and command
- [06:28] line which comes with is Tailwind on the
- [06:30] nextjs and meanwhile I'm going to copy
- [06:33] this text and save it into plan. MD so
- [06:37] that we can have a reference about the
- [06:39] component that it's supposed to create
- [06:41] so I give prom great I move the plan to
- [06:43] plan. MD I've set up in next ja project
- [06:46] in my app folder now let's build the
- [06:48] first components of app layout and
- [06:50] Screen layout which is first few
- [06:52] components but making sure read the
- [06:54] nextjs project structure to make sure
- [06:56] things are in the right place and after
- [06:58] Implement each component add a check
- [07:00] mark in plan uh so we can keep track
- [07:03] about what's
- [07:04] left and this process will take a while
- [07:07] you kind of just need to wait and
- [07:09] see cool and now if I open it you can
- [07:13] see that it had turned this into a web
- [07:15] application and everything looks exactly
- [07:18] like what we have before and all we need
- [07:19] to do just ask you to do step by step so
- [07:22] I just continue prompt it great now
- [07:24] let's do the bot navigation bar and
- [07:26] header in navigation folder
- [07:33] and again I will just continue ask it to
- [07:35] do more
- [07:36] components cool so now you can see a
- [07:38] check out all the pages that is supposed
- [07:40] to create and if I switch to the nextjs
- [07:43] app you can see that this app looks
- [07:45] exactly like the UI we have before you
- [07:47] can change number here you also have
- [07:49] analytics page as well as setting page
- [07:52] and each component is fully functional
- [07:54] all you need to do just start building
- [07:56] backend function so this example of how
- [07:58] can you create v0 level UI without v0
- [08:02] which means you don't have to be limited
- [08:04] by chass CN components you can literally
- [08:06] ask Cloud 3.7 to create any sort of
- [08:09] styles you like and building your own
- [08:12] component Library if you want to learn
- [08:13] more in depth about that specific Cloud
- [08:15] 3.7 design process as well as a prompt
- [08:17] that I've been using you can join the AI
- [08:19] Builder Cloud community and building
- [08:21] where I have list out all the detailed
- [08:22] prompt and process plus I'm releasing
- [08:24] this AI coding tool called 10x coder
- [08:27] death for the AI Builder club members to
- [08:29] try free which is basic platform where
- [08:30] you can go and describe the project you
- [08:32] want to build like a not taking app you
- [08:34] can upload some screenshot as well and
- [08:36] based on that it will start generating
- [08:37] some cursor rules around the UI help you
- [08:40] break it down into specific feature that
- [08:42] might require to build this app as well
- [08:43] as design the project structure and
- [08:45] database schema but most importantly in
- [08:47] the end you will be able to export a
- [08:49] nextjs project that you can open in
- [08:51] cursor or wi surf they already have the
- [08:53] user authentication strip payment and
- [08:56] super based backand setup I will
- [08:58] continuously sharing more content as
- [09:00] well as building exclusive tools for
- [09:02] community members if you're interested
- [09:03] you can click on the link in the
- [09:04] description below to join the community
- [09:06] I hope you enjoy this video and very
- [09:07] keen to see what type of UI you start
- [09:09] building with Cloud 3.7 designers thank
- [09:12] you and I see you next time
