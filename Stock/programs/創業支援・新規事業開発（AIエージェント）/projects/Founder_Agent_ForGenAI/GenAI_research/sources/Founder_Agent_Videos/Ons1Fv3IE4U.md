- [00:00] Hey! It's me again, and I'm back to talk about agents. In my last videos, I covered topics like
- [00:06] the differences between agentic AI and conversational assistants, and I even explained
- [00:11] orchestrator agents. You know, the ones that are supervising how work gets done across tools and
- [00:17] other agents, knowing which agents do what and are basically like a nervous system for AI tools.
- [00:23] Orchestrator agents are helpful when we have multiple sub-agents collaborating or working
- [00:29] together. More on that later. But, quick tip: When this happens, we have what's called a multi-agent
- [00:36] system. Of course, there are various types of this orchestration, like centralized or hierarchical.
- [00:42] But that's for another video. Today, we're going to lift the hood and explore what's happening under
- [00:48] the covers. Let's talk about what's going on when multi-agent systems work together to get work
- [00:55] done through an orchestrator agent. Let's use an example. Pretend that you're at work and you've
- [01:01] asked an orchestrator agent something like, I need your help to write some customized thank-you
- [01:06] notes to the members of my team that helped me with our most recent project.
- [01:13] The question's been sent in and it's time to get to work. Once the orchestrator agent of choice is
- [01:19] set up, of course, and the APIs are connected for data access and the task execution sequences are
- [01:24] defined, orchestration usually occurs in a few steps. The first step is all around
- [01:31] agent selection. The second is more around workflow
- [01:37] coordination. The third, of course, is the data sharing.
- [01:44] And lastly, of course, is continuous learning. Let's
- [01:51] start with agent selection. This is where the orchestrator agent is doing the part of its job
- [01:56] that's probably most familiar to you if you watched my last video. Think of it as flipping through a
- [02:03] booklet of members on its team that it knows can help. It looks through a catalog of existing
- [02:09] agents and tools and makes a selection for the right ones for the job. If you're writing these
- [02:14] thank-you notes from our example, the orchestrator agent might decide it wants to collaborate with a
- [02:22] project management system, an email-writing or
- [02:28] -generating agent, and the employee appreciation app that your
- [02:35] company uses. The next step is workflow coordination. This is when the orchestrator will
- [02:41] break down the task of getting these thank-you notes into subtasks, assign them to the right
- [02:47] agents or tools, and use APIs to connect any systems to get the right data. The
- [02:54] orchestrator agent is going to integrate via API to the project management system, which of course,
- [03:01] has information on the team members who helped on the different projects. It will leverage the email
- [03:07] generation agent that can generate thank-you notes in a certain tone or style that suits us
- [03:12] best, and the employee appreciation app that your team uses to then send thank-you notes. Then
- [03:19] it's all about data sharing. Each agent or tool executes their subtasks and sends that
- [03:26] information all the way back to the orchestrator agent.
- [03:35] Boom! It's important to note that through this process, the AI agents and tools working together,
- [03:41] which we would actually refer to as sub-agents, are constantly sharing information and context.
- [03:48] The orchestrator keeps the agents in the multi-agent system updated in real time. Quick
- [03:54] pause on our list for just a moment. You likely know better than anyone that most AI users have
- [04:01] more than one tool from various vendors. They're all built a bit differently and can help in
- [04:06] various ways. What happens, though, when the sub-agents or systems where we're pulling data from
- [04:12] are not from the same vendor? Maybe they weren't coded in the same language. What do we do? We
- [04:19] rely on MCP. MCP or model context protocol
- [04:26] gives your agent the ability to ask, hey, give me information about X without knowing
- [04:33] where the information is stored or how it's retrieved. MCP has been described as some as kind
- [04:39] of like a USB-C port for AI applications. The M stands for model, of course,
- [04:46] and this is referring to the large language model at the heart of your agent. The C is context.
- [04:53] This is all about the extra information needed to get work done—maybe documents, search results, or
- [05:00] data from some of those systems we talked about earlier. And the P, of course, is protocol. This is
- [05:06] the standardized way of communicating that lets the model interact with those tools and data
- [05:11] sources. Okay, back to the list. The outcome of the task is packaged all
- [05:18] together into what's called an artifact. Think of that as the deliverable or the result of the task.
- [05:24] Before you know it, the orchestrator agent returns a nicely written thank-you note to each of your
- [05:31] teammates. If you're ready to automate, maybe it'll even ask you if it wants to do it for you through
- [05:37] the employee appreciation tool, all powered by the agent. You don't even have to leave the chat
- [05:42] window. You reply with yes, please, thank you, and get a confirmation that the notes have been sent.
- [05:49] Now, don't forget—that last part of the process is continuous learning. Agents are very, very good at
- [05:56] looking back and can reflect on their work. Orchestrator agents will monitor performance and
- [06:01] make any tweaks needed for next time. Orchestrator agents are not only key to a multi-agent system
- [06:07] strategy but are super helpful when it comes to selecting agents from the job and coordinating
- [06:13] workflows, accessing data thanks to MCP, and reflecting for improvements. Next
- [06:20] time you use AI agents to get work done, instead of supervising them yourself, bring in that
- [06:27] supervisor agent so you can take a break.
