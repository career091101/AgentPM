- [00:00] OpenAI has finally joined the race with
- [00:02] a new platform that helps you make AI
- [00:05] agents and AI workflows. And I wanted to
- [00:07] show you exactly how to create your very
- [00:09] first AI agent with this brand new
- [00:11] platform.
- [00:14] And by the end of the video, you'll have
- [00:16] a working AI agent that will do exactly
- [00:19] this. It will go search the web and find
- [00:21] leads for you. Then it will populate a
- [00:24] Google spreadsheet with those leads and
- [00:27] with their email and all their
- [00:29] information. And then it will pass that
- [00:31] information to a third agent which is
- [00:33] going to be your outreach agent. And
- [00:34] that agent will take that information
- [00:37] and draft customizable emails in your
- [00:40] Gmail account and have it ready to be
- [00:42] sent out in draft mode. And the building
- [00:44] blocks will carry over to pretty much
- [00:46] any AI agent that you want to make. Now,
- [00:48] this is how you get to it. Go to
- [00:50] platform.openai.com. openai.com.
- [00:53] And right here on the left side, you'll
- [00:55] see something called agent and build
- [00:56] agents. That will bring you to this
- [00:58] page, the agent builder. And then you
- [01:00] could open up the agent builder from
- [01:02] here. And this platform is designed for
- [01:04] developers. But just like my other
- [01:06] videos, I'm going to simplify this so
- [01:08] anybody could follow along. You don't
- [01:10] have to be a developer to use this
- [01:11] platform here. Now, to get started, you
- [01:13] could create your own. And by the way,
- [01:15] we're not going to do any coding to
- [01:16] create these. And you could also start
- [01:18] with these templates. They only have a
- [01:20] few right now, but with these templates,
- [01:22] I'll be able to kind of show you the
- [01:24] building blocks, and then we'll fully
- [01:26] build one from scratch. And then by the
- [01:28] time it's done, you could go ahead and
- [01:30] test it even before launching to make
- [01:32] sure everything works as it should. And
- [01:34] if you're just brand new to AI agents, I
- [01:36] thought this would be a good video to
- [01:38] kind of walk you through it step by
- [01:39] step, too. So, even if you've never
- [01:41] built any type of AI agent in any other
- [01:44] platform, this will still make sense to
- [01:46] you. So, we'll start at the very top.
- [01:48] What are AI agents exactly? Well, you're
- [01:50] used to chat GPT, right? That's an AI
- [01:52] chatbot. That is a reactive chatbot. You
- [01:55] ask a question, it gives you an answer.
- [01:57] That's pretty much it. AI agents are
- [02:00] more proactive. You give it a goal and
- [02:02] then it decides what steps it should
- [02:05] take to reach that goal. So, it could
- [02:07] gather information. It usually has
- [02:09] access to different tools that it could
- [02:11] tap into. It could sometimes make
- [02:12] decisions and then it could produce a
- [02:15] result. And a lot of these AI agents
- [02:16] will also have some memory. So this AI
- [02:19] agent builder that OpenAI created is a
- [02:22] visual workbench basically for creating
- [02:24] these agents. So instead of having to
- [02:26] write code, you just use these building
- [02:29] blocks. These are called nodes on this
- [02:31] canvas, right? Each node performs one
- [02:34] very clear job and then the arrows
- [02:36] connect them to show the flow of data.
- [02:39] So you could start with a blank canvas
- [02:41] or from the templates. We'll choose this
- [02:43] customer service template that's just on
- [02:45] the template page. So I could show you
- [02:47] the building blocks here. So all these
- [02:49] little separate boxes that you see,
- [02:50] these are called nodes. And nodes are
- [02:53] basically the core of how you create AI
- [02:55] agents in this platform. So in this
- [02:58] case, there's a start node. This is a
- [03:01] guard rail node. I'll skip over this
- [03:03] one. It's a little bit more advanced.
- [03:04] We'll get back to it. Then you have
- [03:07] these AI agents. So this is a node for
- [03:09] an AI agent. And then it connects to
- [03:13] different conditions. This is another
- [03:14] node and so on. Right? So you could see
- [03:16] all these different nodes that you could
- [03:18] add. Now on the left side you could just
- [03:21] carry these over like this and then that
- [03:24] will start a node. When we build one
- [03:25] from scratch I'll explain a little bit
- [03:27] more on how to build those. But this is
- [03:29] important to understand kind of what
- [03:31] nodes are and you could drag and drop
- [03:32] any of them into this platform from the
- [03:35] left side. The agent node. This one
- [03:37] right here. Let me click on this one.
- [03:39] This is basically the brain of your
- [03:41] entire operation. And in this template,
- [03:44] you could see there are multiple agents.
- [03:46] An agent just doesn't have to be one.
- [03:48] You could connect these agents to each
- [03:50] other to make these AI workflows. And if
- [03:53] you click on any of these agents or grab
- [03:55] one from the left side here, you could
- [03:57] see they have a name. They have a set of
- [03:59] instruction that they follow. They also
- [04:01] have memory with this chat history here.
- [04:04] They could use different AI models
- [04:05] depending on which one you choose to
- [04:07] give it access to. and they could also
- [04:09] access different tools and they have a
- [04:11] response format. So this is the core of
- [04:14] what makes an AI agent here. You'll also
- [04:17] see these notes on top of this template.
- [04:19] So that's this note right here. This is
- [04:21] just a note. So if you are creating this
- [04:25] and you want to remember why you did
- [04:26] something or if you're going to share
- [04:28] this later with anyone, that's what
- [04:30] these notes are for. They're just for
- [04:32] internal documentation on what these
- [04:34] things are doing. You also have these
- [04:36] tools right over here. So you have a
- [04:38] file search node. So that comes in
- [04:40] really handy. That way you could store
- [04:42] searchable documents and it will create
- [04:44] a library that your agent could pull
- [04:46] from. Guard rails are also an important
- [04:49] type because they are a safety check.
- [04:52] They could detect unwanted inputs for
- [04:54] example or outputs. Make sure personal
- [04:56] information doesn't get out there. Make
- [04:58] sure no one is jailbreaking it.
- [05:00] Basically getting the AI model or the AI
- [05:02] agent to do something it shouldn't do.
- [05:04] So these are useful. And you have the
- [05:06] MCP. It lets you connect your agent to
- [05:10] external services like Gmail or Zapier
- [05:13] which then connects to bunch of other
- [05:14] things or your company database. So this
- [05:17] is going to be really useful and I have
- [05:19] covered other agent videos on this
- [05:22] channel plenty. So I have videos on make
- [05:24] Zapier all kinds of different things
- [05:26] NAT. So those are the competitors to
- [05:29] OpenAI but I'll link all the resources
- [05:31] at the end of the video in the
- [05:33] description. Now, to see an agent in
- [05:35] action, since we're using a template,
- [05:37] we're on edit mode right now, but if we
- [05:39] press play, you could see the agent
- [05:41] actually going to work. This one starts
- [05:44] with a chat. So, if I just type in a
- [05:46] chat here, the agent will then go to
- [05:48] work and try to figure out what's going
- [05:50] on. So, it's going through the safety
- [05:51] check here. Then, it's going to classify
- [05:54] the text. You could see it in real time
- [05:55] going to work here. And this is what it
- [05:57] looks like internally. If you publish
- [05:59] this, it will look like a traditional
- [06:01] chatbot. it won't really give you these
- [06:03] things, but when you're testing it, you
- [06:05] want to see exactly how it's flowing
- [06:06] through the information. And you could
- [06:09] see this agent after it classified your
- [06:12] text, it went through the set of
- [06:13] condition like how should I route this
- [06:15] information and it decided to send it to
- [06:18] our information agent. We also have a
- [06:20] return agent, a retention agent, right?
- [06:22] So, this is a little bit more
- [06:24] complicated, but I wanted to show you
- [06:26] here with a template that had bunch of
- [06:28] building blocks because we're going to
- [06:30] basically go from beginner to pretty
- [06:32] advanced in this one video. And we'll
- [06:34] also talk about publishing here once we
- [06:36] actually build one from scratch that
- [06:37] we're going to go ahead and publish. By
- [06:38] default, they all get saved to your
- [06:40] draft. So, anytime you start one, it
- [06:42] will create a draft. You could always
- [06:44] come back to it. I'll jump into this
- [06:46] data enrichment agent. This is a really
- [06:48] simple agent just so you see what a very
- [06:51] basic agent looks like because I wanted
- [06:53] to show you all the building blocks. But
- [06:55] an agent could start just with a start
- [06:56] node here. Then this agent searches the
- [06:59] web and then it basically gives you an
- [07:02] output. Now this is super simple. You
- [07:04] pretty much could use chat GPT for an
- [07:06] agent this simple. But this agent will
- [07:09] have access to all the different tools
- [07:10] and things like that that you can give
- [07:12] it access to. You have your own set of
- [07:14] instructions. So you could go a little
- [07:16] bit beyond just using chat GPTR if you
- [07:18] build these. But the whole point of
- [07:20] these is actually that it's modular. You
- [07:22] could really build it out, right? Things
- [07:24] that you just can't do with a simple
- [07:26] chatbot. Okay. Now, let me show you how
- [07:28] to actually build an agent from scratch.
- [07:30] And I want to build a real agent, a
- [07:32] really powerful agent, too. Not a simple
- [07:34] one that you could see from these
- [07:36] templates, but we'll start simple so you
- [07:38] could follow along here. And then you'll
- [07:40] see the working and building blocks of
- [07:42] this. If it's too complicated, then you
- [07:44] might want to look at a different
- [07:45] platform like Me, Zapier, or N810. I
- [07:48] think they're a little bit simpler. This
- [07:49] is really more designed for developers,
- [07:51] but you can make really powerful agents
- [07:54] here. And it just came out, so they're
- [07:56] probably going to tweak this a lot more
- [07:59] in the near future, too. Now, before we
- [08:01] build this lead generation agent, I also
- [08:03] have a resource that shows you how to
- [08:05] actually implement AI agents to save you
- [08:07] time at work. is called how to use AI
- [08:10] agents to save 20 plus hours a week from
- [08:13] HubSpot. It covers five AI workflows you
- [08:16] can implement at work and it also
- [08:18] includes real tools, prompts, and agent
- [08:20] templates you could use today. And my
- [08:22] personal favorite in this list is the
- [08:24] company brief generator agent. It's an
- [08:26] AI agent that retrieves company
- [08:28] information on your customers and is
- [08:31] perfect for any type of B2B type of
- [08:33] business like my production company for
- [08:35] example. You could also type in a URL
- [08:38] and it'll create a report for you. And
- [08:40] it's not a simple report that you'll get
- [08:42] out of chat GPT. This agent pulls not
- [08:45] just from the web search. It also uses
- [08:47] another tool called glean search. That's
- [08:49] like a company's internal search tool
- [08:52] and your customer database via another
- [08:54] tool called datab bricks. And it outputs
- [08:57] the same result in a consistent format.
- [09:00] So once we built our agent with OpenAI
- [09:02] agent builder, you could build similar
- [09:04] and even more advanced agents using
- [09:06] what's covered in this guide. I'll put a
- [09:08] link in the description where you could
- [09:10] download this guide completely for free.
- [09:11] And thank you for HubSpot for sponsoring
- [09:14] this video and making this resource
- [09:15] available to my audience. Okay, let's
- [09:17] build our lead generation agent. You'll
- [09:19] just click create here to create your
- [09:21] agent. And the best place to start with
- [09:23] this agent is actually the tool that
- [09:25] it's going to use to populate our leads.
- [09:28] So all I did was open up Google Sheets.
- [09:31] Google Sheets is the best place for
- [09:32] this. And I created this template here.
- [09:35] You have a name, a business type, the
- [09:37] address, the phone number, the email, a
- [09:39] column for description, what makes that
- [09:41] business different, and if an email has
- [09:43] been sent to them or not. This could
- [09:45] actually do that step two. Now, every
- [09:47] agent usually comes with these two
- [09:49] nodes. You can actually delete these
- [09:51] here and start from scratch, but you
- [09:53] definitely need a starter node. So that
- [09:54] can be deleted here. So an agent can be
- [09:58] grabbed from here and then your start
- [10:00] node will need to get connected to it
- [10:02] like how it was in the beginning. So
- [10:03] it's really easy drag and drop, right?
- [10:05] So we have our very first agent here.
- [10:08] This is going to be a complete workflow.
- [10:09] So it's going to have multiple different
- [10:10] agents doing different things. So this
- [10:12] very first agent is going to actually
- [10:15] find us leads based on what we search
- [10:17] for. Okay. So I'm going to name this
- [10:19] agent. This is our very first agent in
- [10:21] this sequence. It's going to be three
- [10:23] different agents working together. And
- [10:24] this is going to be a leadfinder agent.
- [10:26] And then you're going to give it a
- [10:28] instruction. These are called system
- [10:30] instructions. And I'm going to explain
- [10:32] this to you right here. Let me open this
- [10:33] up. So this is where real prompt
- [10:37] engineering comes into play. It's not
- [10:39] just basically talking to chat GPT,
- [10:41] although they call that prompt
- [10:42] engineering too. But prompt engineering
- [10:44] at its core is when you build an agent
- [10:47] or any type of AI app. What's the
- [10:49] instruction that you're giving it? This
- [10:51] is where that comes into play. So, I'll
- [10:54] make a page for you so they're really
- [10:55] easy to copy and paste here. But this
- [10:58] first one has a different instruction
- [11:00] than my next one. This is you are a
- [11:01] helpful lead generation agent. And I
- [11:04] give a context on what we are and what I
- [11:06] wanted to do. And then I told it to pass
- [11:08] the information to our next agent, which
- [11:10] I could always come back to once I build
- [11:12] this out because our next agent is a
- [11:14] data entry agent and I already kind of
- [11:15] build this out so I know what the next
- [11:18] one is and I kind of specifically told
- [11:20] it. The more specific you get with these
- [11:23] type of prompts, these system prompts,
- [11:25] the better your agent is going to do.
- [11:27] And in the middle, I also explained
- [11:29] basically the different columns that I
- [11:31] had made in my Google sheet because I
- [11:33] wanted to go find the information and
- [11:35] then eventually put that information
- [11:37] there. And I'm going to save this one.
- [11:38] Then you also have chat history. So you
- [11:41] want to turn this on. It's on by
- [11:43] default. So it could have conversational
- [11:45] memory. Then you could choose your AI
- [11:48] model. So you could use chatpt 5 5 5.1.
- [11:51] You could also choose the type of tools
- [11:54] that he has access to. So the MCP server
- [11:57] is going to give us access to pretty
- [11:58] much any tool in the world. But in this
- [12:01] case, we have file search, we have web
- [12:03] search. Web search is what we want. Now
- [12:06] chatpt by default has web search, right?
- [12:08] So you're used to it. But that's
- [12:09] technically chatpt calling a tool called
- [12:12] web search. That's what it's doing in
- [12:14] the background. Now, I don't have to
- [12:15] fill anything out here, but you can
- [12:17] actually change the context size to be
- [12:19] high. You want it to be able to look for
- [12:22] a lot of information. The high lets you
- [12:24] do that. So, I'm going to go ahead and
- [12:25] add that. And the output format is going
- [12:27] to be text. I'm going to get text and
- [12:29] I'm going to pass it to the next agent
- [12:31] as text. Now, already we have an AI
- [12:34] agent. Okay. So, if I press play right
- [12:37] on top here, it's gonna bring this
- [12:38] chatbot. And if I talk to this chatbot,
- [12:41] it's going to go and try to get us
- [12:42] leads. Okay. but it will get us leads
- [12:45] and respond to us in chat format, which
- [12:47] again we could use just about any
- [12:49] chatbot for what we want to do now is
- [12:52] actually get those leads to nicely
- [12:53] format in our Google sheet and then
- [12:56] reach out to them with email with our
- [12:58] follow-up agent. So the sequence of
- [12:59] agents is going to do that for us. So
- [13:01] we'll go back to edit mode here. Now
- [13:03] let's grab another agent node. We'll
- [13:05] drop that here. So again, they are not
- [13:08] connected by default. You have to grab
- [13:10] this right here and then connect them
- [13:12] like that. And with this agent, what
- [13:15] we're going to do is this is going to be
- [13:17] our data entry agent. So, it's going to
- [13:19] take the leads that it found based on
- [13:21] the different columns for our sheet that
- [13:22] we told it and it's actually going to
- [13:24] input those into that. So, with each
- [13:26] agent, you want it to have a pretty
- [13:28] narrow role. That's how you get it to
- [13:29] really do what you want for the most
- [13:31] part, right? You don't want it to give
- [13:32] it five different things to do like you
- [13:34] might with chat GPTs. Kind of one at a
- [13:36] time and then you could just stack those
- [13:38] agents on top of each other. Okay. Now
- [13:40] this data entry agent might seem a
- [13:42] little bit complicated because it will
- [13:44] have to use an MCP server to do it. Now
- [13:47] if you use other versions of AI agent
- [13:50] platforms that let you build them for
- [13:52] example make Zap year and N8N they
- [13:56] directly connect to other tools like our
- [14:00] Google sheet. This does not. This
- [14:02] requires an MCP server to connect to
- [14:04] different things and we'll actually use
- [14:06] Zapier in between the two. Okay. So, I'm
- [14:09] going to go to tools. I'm going to press
- [14:10] the plus sign and I'm going to choose
- [14:12] MCP server. Hopefully, they just roll
- [14:15] out those other tools like the other
- [14:16] platforms have it. So, you don't have to
- [14:18] do this middle part here. Now, there are
- [14:20] some tools that are related, even Google
- [14:22] Drive, but the actions within those is
- [14:24] very limited right now. And Google Sheet
- [14:26] is just not one we could select here.
- [14:28] Even the Google Drive option doesn't
- [14:30] really do what I want in this case. But
- [14:32] the nice thing is Zapier is an app that
- [14:34] connects bunch of different apps. So,
- [14:35] I'm going to select this instead. And
- [14:37] there is a website here, mcp.zapier.com.
- [14:41] I'm going to go ahead and copy this and
- [14:43] open this up. It's going to ask you to
- [14:44] log into a Zapier account. So, if you
- [14:46] don't have one, you'll have to create
- [14:47] one here. They do have some free credits
- [14:49] available with it, but sometimes you may
- [14:52] have to upgrade depending on if this
- [14:53] ends up being really useful for you and
- [14:55] you're going to use it a lot. And with
- [14:57] Zapier, I could basically connect to
- [14:59] 8,000 different apps and they have like
- [15:01] thousands of actions across all those
- [15:03] apps that you could use. So it could
- [15:05] find a Google sheet, it could write in
- [15:07] it. All those things are done through
- [15:08] Zapier. And then once you log into
- [15:10] Zapier, I'm going to choose this one,
- [15:12] new MCP server right on top. And then
- [15:15] it's going to ask us what our client is.
- [15:17] That's just basically the company and
- [15:19] the API that we want to use. So OpenAI
- [15:22] agent builder. That's the platform we're
- [15:23] using. So we're going to choose that.
- [15:25] I'll call this lead genen agent here.
- [15:27] And we'll create our server. Then it
- [15:29] asks you what tool this MCP server has
- [15:31] access to. What can it do? Google sheet.
- [15:34] And in this case, we want the agent to
- [15:37] be able to create rows inside of the
- [15:40] Google sheet we already created, right?
- [15:42] You can give it access to all kinds of
- [15:43] different things that you can do inside
- [15:45] of Google sheet. I'll choose this option
- [15:46] right here. And you could also choose
- [15:49] some configuration here. So obviously I
- [15:51] need to choose an account for my Google
- [15:53] Drive. Then I'm going to choose right
- [15:55] here, set a specific value from my
- [15:57] Google Drive. I'm going to choose my
- [15:59] Google Drive here. And then we want a
- [16:01] specific spreadsheet, right? because I
- [16:03] only give it access to that spreadsheet.
- [16:05] So, I'm going to say right here, set a
- [16:08] specific value and then I picked that
- [16:10] specific spreadsheet. So, that's why I
- [16:12] created the spreadsheet as the very
- [16:14] first task inside of the same Google
- [16:16] account. So, make sure that was the
- [16:17] first thing you did here. And I also
- [16:20] made sure the worksheet is set to sheet
- [16:22] one. That document only had one sheet.
- [16:25] So, this is just more extra here. But
- [16:27] everything else I'm going to leave on
- [16:29] default, right? The AI needs to fill out
- [16:31] all those different things. But you can
- [16:32] see it pulled in that information at
- [16:34] least the header for all those different
- [16:36] sections of that sheet. So I'm going to
- [16:38] save this. Now we have to connect it to
- [16:40] OpenAI. So right on top it's going to
- [16:41] tell you that's your next step. Now this
- [16:43] creates a API key or basically a secret
- [16:46] key. It's a handshake between these two
- [16:48] platforms. So they could actually talk
- [16:50] to each other. So copy this with APIs.
- [16:53] Anytime you see APIs just that's a key
- [16:55] that lets two different apps talk to
- [16:57] each other. in this case, the agent
- [16:59] builder and our Zapier account. So, I'm
- [17:02] going to copy this one. And this is the
- [17:04] Zapier MCP server that we've created.
- [17:07] I'll go back to agent builder and we'll
- [17:09] type in that API key here. This is our
- [17:11] Zapier MCP. So, I'm going to connect the
- [17:13] two. Now, this part is actually asking
- [17:15] you, do you want it to access and add
- [17:17] other tools and edit other tools? I
- [17:19] actually don't want that. I want to
- [17:21] limit the control that this server has.
- [17:23] I don't want it to just add bunch of
- [17:24] tools in Zapier. doesn't need to do that
- [17:27] in this case, but you can add that and
- [17:28] it's on by default. I only want it to
- [17:31] have access to the thing I'm telling it
- [17:32] to do so it doesn't get confused. So,
- [17:35] very specifically, I check this on and
- [17:37] I'm going to add it. And then you'll see
- [17:38] it added it over here. One more thing I
- [17:41] actually forgot to add here. So, I'll go
- [17:43] back to it. Under approval, always
- [17:45] require approval for all tool calls. In
- [17:48] this case, I could say never require
- [17:50] approval. Now, you can turn this on if
- [17:52] you're going to give it access to bunch
- [17:53] of tools and it might have too much
- [17:55] control. In this case, I limited it, so
- [17:57] I'm going to say never. So, it doesn't
- [17:59] ask me and it could go to work and I'm
- [18:01] going to update it. So, anytime you
- [18:02] could click a tool to update it
- [18:04] settings. Okay. Now, every single time
- [18:06] you create an agent, the instruction
- [18:08] part is a very important part. So, let's
- [18:10] go ahead and open this up. So, in this
- [18:12] case, I really spelled out exactly what
- [18:15] I want to happen. So if I was teaching
- [18:18] someone for the very first time how to
- [18:20] do this for me, I would walk them
- [18:22] through and they would watch me do it.
- [18:24] So while I was doing it manually, I just
- [18:27] wrote down all the steps, right?
- [18:29] Retrieve the lead information from the
- [18:31] previous agent and then pass it to this
- [18:33] agent. And these are the things I want
- [18:35] you to put in these columns. And that's
- [18:37] it for this agent. We'll go ahead and
- [18:39] save this one here. And we'll have our
- [18:41] final agent. So, so far it's going to go
- [18:44] search the web, find the leads based on
- [18:45] what we're going to give it in chat.
- [18:47] Then it's going to go and add that to
- [18:49] our Google sheet. Then we're going to
- [18:51] actually have the agent outreach. So,
- [18:54] I'll call this one outreach agent. So,
- [18:55] this will literally do the outreach for
- [18:57] us, right? It's not just finding leads,
- [18:59] giving us a sheet. I wanted to take that
- [19:02] even a further step here. And since I
- [19:04] already showed you Zapier, which is
- [19:05] probably the most complicated part of
- [19:07] using this is that MCP server. So, it
- [19:09] can't find tools. I just felt like
- [19:11] without tools, this would not be that
- [19:13] good of a video. I feel like custom GPTs
- [19:16] could almost do that inside of chat GPT.
- [19:19] Now, this also needs that tool first.
- [19:21] Let me just change the agent and then
- [19:23] we'll come in and put in our
- [19:24] instructions here, but let's go ahead
- [19:26] and choose our Zapier tool. So, it's
- [19:28] going to be MCP server Zapier again. So,
- [19:31] same kind of thing we looked at before
- [19:32] by going to this site again, this
- [19:34] portion. Okay, it took us to the same
- [19:36] place again, but we're going to add a
- [19:38] new tool and this is going to be Gmail.
- [19:39] So you could send out an email and draft
- [19:41] it. And with Gmail, we want to create a
- [19:44] draft. So you could search up here,
- [19:46] create, create a draft is what we want.
- [19:49] In this case, I do want to manually look
- [19:50] at this, but then I could just go
- [19:52] through a bunch of different email
- [19:54] drafts that is created for us and then
- [19:56] press send. I find that to be a little
- [19:57] bit safer. And for configuration, again,
- [20:00] add to your right accounts. Now, the
- [20:02] body needs to be generated with AI, so
- [20:04] we're going to leave that. But we do
- [20:05] have some advanced options. One of them
- [20:07] that I do recommend is body type. You
- [20:10] could actually set this to be HTML. So,
- [20:13] I'm going to change it to specific and
- [20:15] I'm going to change it to HTML just
- [20:16] because HTML just creates better
- [20:18] formatting, the headings and things like
- [20:20] that. But the plane sometimes does work.
- [20:22] This is one thing I do like to change.
- [20:23] So, I'll save that. The Google sheet
- [20:25] also needs to be able to look up a
- [20:27] Google sheet because the previous one
- [20:28] only let us write something in a Google
- [20:30] sheet. So, I'm going to add a tool.
- [20:31] We'll use Google sheet again, but this
- [20:33] time I want to look up a specific row in
- [20:36] a sheet. So, we'll select this option.
- [20:38] And then again, I'm going to choose
- [20:39] specifically that sheet, right? That
- [20:41] spreadsheet. Even though AI might be
- [20:44] able to guess that, I don't want it to
- [20:45] make any mistakes. And the worksheet,
- [20:47] again, I'm going to choose that one to
- [20:49] be our only sheets there. Okay. And
- [20:52] everything else I'm going to leave on
- [20:54] default. So, pretty much every time I'm
- [20:56] just choosing that specific sheet here
- [20:58] to make sure it doesn't look elsewhere
- [21:00] in my Google sheet or my Google Drive.
- [21:02] And then one more tool inside of Google
- [21:05] Sheet that I need to add, which is
- [21:07] updating the sheet. I'll choose this one
- [21:09] here with line item support. I'll choose
- [21:12] advanced and then do the exact same
- [21:14] thing. Basically, choose the right
- [21:15] spreadsheet and limit it to that one
- [21:18] sheet on that spreadsheet. Let's save
- [21:20] that. Okay. So, Google Sheets has three
- [21:21] different actions that it could take
- [21:23] inside of that tool. and Gmail has one
- [21:25] now. And all we have to do is go to
- [21:27] connect here, copy our secret key, and
- [21:29] then take it to our agent builder.
- [21:32] Again, I'll name it the same thing here.
- [21:33] Let's connect. I changed the approval to
- [21:35] never require. And I also uncheck these
- [21:38] two that are checked by default. And
- [21:40] I'll add it now. And for our
- [21:42] instruction, I really spelled out what I
- [21:44] want to happen here. And you could ask
- [21:46] chat GPT to kind of help you expand it
- [21:48] out if you just use a few couple of
- [21:51] sentences maybe to describe it. But I
- [21:53] like to really spell out step by step
- [21:55] what's happening. I just found it that
- [21:57] prompt engineering with these system
- [21:59] prompts makes for good AI agents.
- [22:01] Otherwise, it's going to be a little bit
- [22:03] frustrating because it's just going to
- [22:04] go off the rails here. But again, I'll
- [22:07] have a sheet with what I'm using here
- [22:09] with those three different agents and
- [22:10] the system prompt you could copy and
- [22:12] paste. And it's ultimately saying to
- [22:14] find the leads and then draft a tailored
- [22:16] email. That's why I had a one row that
- [22:19] had the description field that made that
- [22:22] difference. So, it has that information
- [22:24] to actually make a better email
- [22:27] outreach, right? It actually finds
- [22:29] things that are relevant to that
- [22:30] business. It's not just a plain email
- [22:33] it's writing every time. That's the
- [22:34] whole point of the lead genen to
- [22:35] customize it for that business here. And
- [22:37] it will also be able to change what's on
- [22:39] that row. So, I know an email has been
- [22:41] sent for example. So, right now
- [22:44] everything was set to no. it will change
- [22:45] it to yes once it drives that email. So
- [22:48] we'll save that. Okay. I'm going to go
- [22:49] back to that same sheet. I'm just going
- [22:51] to erase everything. So then we'll
- [22:53] populate here with new information.
- [22:55] Okay. Now with the agent complete, all I
- [22:57] have to do is go up here and it creates
- [22:59] a chatbot for us. Right. So this is the
- [23:01] same as talking to chat GPT except it's
- [23:04] now going to go through this workflow,
- [23:06] reference everything we have. And my
- [23:07] prompt actually in this box is really
- [23:09] simple. Find me five video production
- [23:11] companies in Chicago. So, you just have
- [23:12] to type in the type of business and the
- [23:14] location. And the type of business could
- [23:17] be anything, dentists, law firms. It
- [23:19] will still work with all the system
- [23:20] prompts that I've set up. So, this is
- [23:23] going to first, you'll see every time an
- [23:25] agent gets called, it will go to work.
- [23:27] So, the start node was just the chat is
- [23:30] finding me those video production
- [23:31] companies here. And then now, okay, it
- [23:34] found me five. The data entry agent is
- [23:37] going to go ahead and add that to our
- [23:38] sheet, which I've cleared out here. And
- [23:42] let me let this one go to work here.
- [23:44] This may take a few minutes. Okay. So
- [23:46] then your second agent should populate
- [23:49] this Google sheet with the all the right
- [23:51] information and with the email address.
- [23:54] And in this case, all these emails that
- [23:56] are set to be sent should say no. And
- [24:00] the descriptions all should be different
- [24:01] here because it's going to use that
- [24:03] information to create a custom email for
- [24:05] every single person. It's not copy and
- [24:07] pasting the same exact email. And then
- [24:09] the third agent is the outreach agent
- [24:12] that should create the drafts for you in
- [24:14] your inbox. So these are the different
- [24:16] drafts that I have here. And I'll click
- [24:18] on one of them. And it's nicely
- [24:20] formatted here. It has the subject line
- [24:22] that is different based on that
- [24:23] production company here. And this part
- [24:26] of the email is different every time.
- [24:29] That's what the agent extracted. Now you
- [24:31] could personalize this a lot more a lot
- [24:34] differently than mine based on your
- [24:36] system prompt, right? So, make sure your
- [24:38] system prompt tells you how you want the
- [24:40] email. You could even give it an exact
- [24:42] type of a email template. And you could
- [24:44] always publish these. And I actually
- [24:46] forgot to name this one. You could
- [24:47] always name it right on top here. So,
- [24:49] we'll name it now AI Legent Agent and
- [24:52] publish. Now, this is going to be
- [24:53] published in your workspace. So, this is
- [24:56] how I would use it every time. You'll
- [24:57] come back and use it here with press and
- [24:59] play and use it here. Now this is where
- [25:01] it gets a lot more complicated and
- [25:03] definitely requires a lot more advanced
- [25:05] knowledge and even a developer. They
- [25:07] have something called chatkit which then
- [25:10] you would have to share to add this to
- [25:12] your website. So this part does require
- [25:14] a lot more advanced knowledge. If you
- [25:16] want to put this in your app or your
- [25:18] website, I recommend getting a developer
- [25:21] for this step. Just build the agent,
- [25:23] test it out. You could use it here
- [25:25] anytime you want. But if you do want to
- [25:27] add it to your website, definitely not
- [25:29] simple right now. I still use Chatbase.
- [25:31] That's my favorite platform for creating
- [25:33] agents that could easily get embedded to
- [25:36] your website. I have plenty of videos
- [25:37] about that on my channel as well. Now,
- [25:39] as I'm recording this, the Zapier MCP
- [25:42] that is in beta. The OpenAI agent
- [25:45] builder also in beta. So, you may come
- [25:47] across some issues. I just wanted to
- [25:49] make this video as this came out, but it
- [25:51] does have issues. It sometimes took me
- [25:53] three or four different chats to get it
- [25:56] to work. That's why I don't think it's
- [25:57] ready for publishing publicly, but it's
- [26:01] great as an internal tool. So, hopefully
- [26:03] this gives you a good understanding of
- [26:04] what the Open AI agent builder is and
- [26:07] how to get something out of it that is
- [26:09] useful. And there are plenty of other AI
- [26:11] agent builders out there. Some of them
- [26:13] are a lot easier like Zapier, Make Natn,
- [26:16] and even Google has a new one too. And
- [26:19] I've covered most of them on this
- [26:20] channel. So, I'll put some resources in
- [26:22] the description. And on our platform,
- [26:24] Skill, we also have an AI agent builder
- [26:27] course along with 30 other courses that
- [26:29] you get access to. I recommend you watch
- [26:31] that with the free trial and I'll link
- [26:33] that in the description below this
- [26:34] video, too. Thanks so much for watching
- [26:36] this video and I'll see you on the next
