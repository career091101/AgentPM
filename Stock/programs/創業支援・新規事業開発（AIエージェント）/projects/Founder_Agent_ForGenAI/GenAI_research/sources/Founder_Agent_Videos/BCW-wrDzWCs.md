- [00:00] This week, we got a ton of cool new AI
- [00:02] tools that you can play with right now.
- [00:05] And on this channel, I love to actually
- [00:07] share the AI advancements and things
- [00:09] that might actually change how you do
- [00:13] things. I don't want to waste your time.
- [00:14] So, let's get into demoing all the cool
- [00:17] stuff that came out this week. Starting
- [00:19] with ChatGpt's new agent feature. Now,
- [00:22] this one's really interesting. It's very
- [00:24] similar to the operator that they
- [00:26] released earlier where it sort of starts
- [00:29] up a virtual browser and then can go and
- [00:31] do things on your behalf. But this one
- [00:33] seems to have access to even more tools
- [00:35] and be able to even do more things on
- [00:37] your behalf. You can now ask ChatGpt to
- [00:39] handle requests like look at my calendar
- [00:41] and brief me on upcoming client meetings
- [00:44] based on recent news, plan and buy
- [00:46] ingredients to make Japanese breakfast
- [00:47] for four and analyze three competitors
- [00:50] and create a slide deck. Chat GPT will
- [00:51] intelligently navigate websites, filter
- [00:53] results, prompt you to log in securely
- [00:55] when needed, run code, conduct analysis,
- [00:57] and even deliver editable slideshows and
- [01:00] spreadsheets that summarize its
- [01:01] findings. And one interesting note is
- [01:04] during the keynote, Sam Alman actually
- [01:06] mentioned that these tools now can even
- [01:08] take your credit card details and make
- [01:10] purchases on your behalf. But then he
- [01:13] also warned us that you might want to be
- [01:15] careful using that and let the operator
- [01:17] hand it back to you when handling
- [01:19] sensitive data like that.
- [01:20] >> Although this is an extremely exciting
- [01:22] new technology, there are new risks.
- [01:24] People are going to need to learn to use
- [01:26] AI agents uh and societyy's going to
- [01:28] need to learn to build up defenses
- [01:29] against attacks on AI agents as well,
- [01:31] >> which is just kind of fascinating that
- [01:33] Open AI would put a product out into the
- [01:35] world and then kind of say, "Yeah, it's
- [01:37] kind of risky, but use it at your own
- [01:39] risk." and well, I'm going to risk it
- [01:40] and let's actually really put it to the
- [01:43] test and see if maybe we can find a
- [01:45] breaking point or if it's really going
- [01:47] to blow us away. So, when I head over to
- [01:48] my chat GPT account, I get this new
- [01:50] introducing agent mode. ChatGpt can now
- [01:53] work on its own computer from research
- [01:55] and spreadsheets to booking reservations
- [01:56] and more. Now, as of right now, the day
- [01:58] I'm recording this, this is only
- [02:00] available to pro users, so on the $200 a
- [02:03] month plan. However, in their live
- [02:05] stream presentation around this, they
- [02:07] did say that it will be rolling out to
- [02:09] the other paid plans within a few days.
- [02:12] So, might even be that by the time
- [02:14] you're watching this, it is in the plus
- [02:16] plan and uh you know, the the $20 a
- [02:18] month plan and the less expensive plans.
- [02:20] And what I want to do is I really want
- [02:22] to put to the test. What excites me is
- [02:24] getting it to go and sort of plan and do
- [02:27] multi-step complicated processes for me.
- [02:31] So, let's go ahead and click try it. I'm
- [02:32] going to pretend that my wife's birthday
- [02:34] is coming up cuz I want to see if this
- [02:36] will book the perfect date night for me.
- [02:38] So, I'm going to give it a pretty
- [02:39] detailed prompt here. Book a date night
- [02:41] for my wife's birthday in 2 weeks. Find
- [02:43] a restaurant that allows online booking
- [02:45] and is a top rated restaurant in San
- [02:47] Diego. It shouldn't be more than $100
- [02:49] total per person. Look for openings on
- [02:51] Thursday or Friday of next week around 6
- [02:54] p.m. Book the reservation for two. Also,
- [02:57] find me a new pair of pants and matching
- [02:59] long sleeve shirt that goes well with
- [03:00] the pants. I'm 6' 3 and have a 34 inch
- [03:02] waist and 34 inch length. I typically
- [03:04] wear XL shirts, make sure they look
- [03:07] classy, and order them for me. Also, buy
- [03:09] my wife a birthday present that's $200
- [03:11] max. She loves new video games, camping
- [03:13] gear, travel, and reading. I'm just
- [03:15] going to throw all of that into a single
- [03:17] prompt and see what it does for me. See
- [03:19] how far it gets. All right, so setting
- [03:21] up a desktop. And now we can actually
- [03:23] see it using my computer, my virtual
- [03:25] computer. So everything you're seeing is
- [03:27] happening autonomously. I'm not clicking
- [03:29] on anything. It's actually reading
- [03:30] articles for me. And you know what?
- [03:32] While it's doing that, I think one of
- [03:34] the big benefits of this whole agent
- [03:36] concept is that theoretically, we can go
- [03:39] and have a whole bunch of different
- [03:40] agents doing different tasks for us all
- [03:42] at the same time. I could set one agent
- [03:44] off to be working on setting up my date
- [03:46] night. I could set another agent off to
- [03:48] do another task and another agent to do
- [03:50] another task. And it's like little
- [03:51] workers all kind of going and doing my
- [03:53] bidding for me. Right. So, I've got this
- [03:55] second one here going saying, "I'm
- [03:57] presenting my website, Future Tools, to
- [03:59] a new advertiser next week. Can you make
- [04:00] a PowerPoint presentation that covers
- [04:02] anything that will help me sell them on
- [04:04] advertising on my website?" And you can
- [04:06] see I've already kind of got this one
- [04:07] rolling now. I just I hit submit like 30
- [04:10] seconds ago, so it's barely been
- [04:11] running. And then I'm going to go ahead
- [04:12] and get a third one started here. I need
- [04:14] an analysis of my YouTube channel, Matt
- [04:16] Wolf, over the past 180 days by
- [04:18] highlighting successes and failures. Put
- [04:20] all relevant data into a spreadsheet.
- [04:22] create a pie chart based on the data
- [04:24] that reflects all the different topics
- [04:26] of videos on my channel and then add to
- [04:28] the spreadsheet 10 new video ideas based
- [04:30] on those results. Three different agents
- [04:32] going off and doing different tasks.
- [04:34] We'll check back in in a few minutes and
- [04:36] see how all of them performed. All
- [04:38] right, so on my first attempt here with
- [04:40] agent, I got kind of frustrated because
- [04:42] on that more complex prompt where I
- [04:45] asked it to do multiple things like book
- [04:47] me a reservation, order me some pants
- [04:50] and order a present. Well, it just
- [04:52] inexplicably stopped after 16 minutes
- [04:55] with no actual result. I could still
- [04:57] scrub through this and see everything
- [04:59] that it tried to do, but when I get to
- [05:01] the end here, it just decided it was
- [05:02] done. I'm not going to keep going. And
- [05:04] that was really frustrating after having
- [05:06] waited for 16 minutes. Now, I am
- [05:09] recording this on the launch day, so
- [05:10] there is a good chance their servers are
- [05:12] just overwhelmed, overloaded. But I'm
- [05:14] also on the $200 a month pro plan, so
- [05:16] it's not like everybody who has chat GPT
- [05:18] has access to this right now. So, a
- [05:20] little annoying, but I did go ahead and
- [05:23] well give it the exact same prompt.
- [05:25] Literally copied it and pasted into a
- [05:26] new chat. And I have it running again to
- [05:29] see how it'll do. It's been running for
- [05:31] like 20 minutes this second time around.
- [05:33] And it feels like it's getting a little
- [05:35] bit further than last time. So, we'll
- [05:37] see how that plays out. But the other
- [05:38] two agents that I ran did finish. So,
- [05:41] the first one I did was I asked it to
- [05:44] create a slide presentation for the
- [05:45] Future Tools website. And it worked for
- [05:48] 41 minutes.
- [05:49] >> Ain't nobody got time for that.
- [05:51] >> After 41 minutes, it said, "Here's your
- [05:53] finished presentation. It highlights
- [05:54] Future Tool.io's mission, audience
- [05:56] insights, community reach, etc., etc."
- [05:58] And I can actually click through the
- [06:00] slides right here. I can download them,
- [06:03] and I can also go full screen and look
- [06:05] at the slides directly from within
- [06:07] ChatGpt. So, let's go ahead and see how
- [06:09] it did. advertising with futuretools.io,
- [06:12] your gateway to AI enthusiasts and
- [06:13] innovators. I mean, I wouldn't say it's
- [06:15] the like best design slide I've ever
- [06:18] seen. Like, what's going on here? I
- [06:19] don't know. What is Future Tools?
- [06:21] Curates AI tools for enhanced
- [06:22] productivity. Future Tools collects and
- [06:24] organizes all the best tools so you can
- [06:25] become superhuman. That's just like the
- [06:27] headline from the page. Pretty ugly
- [06:29] slide to be honest. All right. Traffic
- [06:30] overview. Let's see. Monthly visits.
- [06:33] This must be in thousands of visitors
- [06:35] because I promise you it gets more than
- [06:37] 500 visitors a month in April. just shy
- [06:39] of 500,000. In May, over 500 in June,
- [06:42] just shy of 500,000. And we're recording
- [06:44] it in July, so it doesn't have July's
- [06:46] data yet. Not a bad slide here. Not
- [06:48] welldesigned at all, but it's got the
- [06:51] information on the slide. All right.
- [06:52] Audience and sources, top countries.
- [06:55] Well, that's not helpful. It made a pie
- [06:57] chart, but it doesn't actually say what
- [07:00] countries are each slice of the pie.
- [07:02] Same with traffic sources. like it made
- [07:04] a pie chart, but it doesn't say anywhere
- [07:07] that I can see. Community engagement.
- [07:09] So, Future Tools newsletter 150,000 plus
- [07:12] subscribers. I mean, technically that's
- [07:14] true. YouTube channel 737,000
- [07:16] subscribers. That's not up to date
- [07:18] either. 57 million views. I'm I'm over
- [07:20] 60 million now. Um, and then 10 to 18
- [07:23] minute average video length probably
- [07:24] still accurate. Power of AR advertising,
- [07:26] personalized targeting, boost sales,
- [07:28] real time. So, this is just like these
- [07:29] are reasons you might want to advertise.
- [07:31] Partnering with future tools means your
- [07:32] brand benefits from intelligent
- [07:33] targeting algorithms ensuring your
- [07:35] message resonates with an engaged AI
- [07:36] savvy audience. I mean that that's
- [07:37] accurate advertising opportunities on
- [07:39] size placements newsletter video on
- [07:41] YouTube crossplatform packages all still
- [07:44] relevant. Partner with future tools. And
- [07:46] that's the last slide. I mean what do
- [07:48] you think? I don't think it's that
- [07:50] impressive. It doesn't have the most
- [07:52] up-to-date information. It's pulling
- [07:53] information from like months ago. It had
- [07:55] traffic stats through June, but then
- [07:57] like subscriber and view numbers from
- [08:00] like months before that and the design
- [08:03] not great. I mean, it's really
- [08:04] impressive that it was able to go do
- [08:06] that all autonomously. Like, don't get
- [08:08] me wrong, but if I just saw this slide
- [08:10] deck and I'm just making an objective
- [08:12] decision, this is objectively a bad
- [08:14] slide deck, albeit completely made by
- [08:17] AI. So, cool that AI is capable of going
- [08:20] and doing everything it did. Not super
- [08:22] impressed with the output yet, but it's
- [08:24] getting there closer and closer every
- [08:25] day. All right, so I need an analysis of
- [08:27] my YouTube channel over the past 180
- [08:29] days, etc., etc. Make a pigraph, blah,
- [08:32] blah, blah. All right, key findings. So,
- [08:34] it made a list of my top performing
- [08:36] videos. 27 free things you can do with
- [08:38] Gemini, Deepseek, the Chinese AI that
- [08:40] crashed the markets. These are all
- [08:41] videos that performed well. Here's my
- [08:43] low performing videos. The least viewed
- [08:45] upload was how to make these viral AI
- [08:47] video memes for free, which I don't feel
- [08:49] like is great that it put that there
- [08:51] because that's also my newest video. It
- [08:53] really hasn't had time to collect views
- [08:55] yet. So, it didn't sort of wait based on
- [08:58] recency at all with this. It figured out
- [09:00] topic distribution, insights, and
- [09:02] successes. But what I really asked it
- [09:04] for was to make me a spreadsheet, and it
- [09:06] did. And I can export this as an Excel
- [09:08] spreadsheet here, or I can view it in
- [09:10] full screen. And we can see that it did
- [09:12] what we asked it to where it listed all
- [09:14] the videos, showed the views in
- [09:17] thousands here, and then it gave it some
- [09:19] sort of success metric. I don't know how
- [09:21] it decided whether it was success or
- [09:22] not. Uh it said this one with 333,000
- [09:25] views was a success, but these other
- [09:27] ones like 109,000 views was not a
- [09:29] success. Like I don't know what it's
- [09:32] gauging that on, I guess. Then down at
- [09:33] the bottom, we can see another tab, new
- [09:35] video ideas. So it suggested a handful
- [09:37] of new video ideas. This internal
- [09:38] browser here does not actually let me
- [09:41] resize the columns. So I can't actually
- [09:42] read these. But if we look at the
- [09:43] bottom, we can see them. Top 10 AI tools
- [09:45] that save creators hours. Perplexity
- [09:47] vers GPT versus Gemini. An interview,
- [09:50] which is interesting. Interview behind
- [09:52] the scenes with Anthropics Claude team.
- [09:54] It's interesting that it suggested that
- [09:56] seeing as it listed my interview videos
- [09:58] as my underperformers. So why is it
- [10:00] suggesting a concept that's proven to
- [10:03] underperform on my channel? I don't
- [10:04] know. And then category chart data. All
- [10:07] right. So, this is informing the pie
- [10:09] chart that we saw down at the bottom.
- [10:10] That's kind of annoying that it uh did
- [10:12] it that way. Like, I have to click
- [10:14] between tabs to see what each thing is.
- [10:16] It did what we asked it to, just not in
- [10:18] the best way. And then we have a pie
- [10:19] chart image, which is obviously a little
- [10:20] bit more helpful. We can see that news
- [10:22] videos represent 65.1%, tools 18.6,
- [10:26] interview 7%, creative projects and
- [10:28] education both 4.7%. Over time, we're
- [10:31] going to see this tools one grow bigger
- [10:33] and bigger, but it did okay. This one
- [10:35] only actually thought for 4 minutes when
- [10:38] that other one we just looked at to make
- [10:39] the slide deck thought for 41 minutes.
- [10:42] And my date night thing is still
- [10:44] running. It's still trying to find
- [10:46] pants. It's actually been looking for
- [10:47] pants for a really, really long time.
- [10:49] So, we'll jump back to this in a second.
- [10:50] So, it finally finished running this
- [10:52] process here. It worked for 50 minutes,
- [10:59] but we could see all of the stuff it
- [11:00] did. It actually didn't take the actions
- [11:02] on my behalf. I think I must have needed
- [11:05] to be sitting at my computer and taking
- [11:07] it over and entering details and things,
- [11:09] which sort of defeats the purpose cuz if
- [11:11] something is going to take 50 minutes,
- [11:13] do I really want to be sitting at my
- [11:15] computer waiting for it to ask me to
- [11:17] take it over? But it did give me a
- [11:18] breakdown of of everything here. So,
- [11:21] dinner reservation, looked at top rated
- [11:22] restaurants under $100, etc., etc.
- [11:24] Settled on Bona Orchetta in South Park.
- [11:27] I don't think I've actually been there.
- [11:28] All right. Found a reservation slot for
- [11:30] Thursday, July 31st at 6:00 p.m. for two
- [11:33] people 2 weeks from today. It does say
- [11:35] to finalize your reservation. Open Table
- [11:37] requires a phone number or email. Please
- [11:39] let me know when you're ready to enter
- [11:40] your contact info and I'll proceed.
- [11:42] Under clothing, it found some stuff on
- [11:43] Amazon. Amazon Essentials men's classic
- [11:46] fit. I'm never going to wear Amazon
- [11:48] Essentials pants. I'm sorry. Uh shirt, a
- [11:50] Jver men solid long sleeve dress shirt.
- [11:53] Both items are in your Amazon cart. Is
- [11:55] that actually true? It didn't have my
- [11:57] Amazon login. Oh, it's in my Amazon cart
- [12:00] inside of the virtual computer. Birthday
- [12:02] gift. I selected the Amazon Kindle
- [12:04] Paperwhite. Good idea, actually. But she
- [12:06] already has one. Uh, your Amazon cart
- [12:07] subtotal for pants, shirt, and Kendall.
- [12:09] 203.98.
- [12:10] Would you like me to proceed with the
- [12:12] checkout process for these items? So, if
- [12:14] I actually give it my Amazon login
- [12:16] details, give it my phone number, give
- [12:18] it my email address, it should be able
- [12:20] to go and take all the rest of those
- [12:21] steps on my behalf. The other option is
- [12:24] I can click on these three dots and take
- [12:26] over the browser. And if I click take
- [12:27] over the browser, I now have control
- [12:30] over what's going on on this browser and
- [12:32] I can actually click around in these
- [12:33] tabs and I can see uh there's nothing
- [12:36] actually in the cart. Oh, there is stuff
- [12:38] in the cart. Okay, so it did add this
- [12:40] stuff to the cart, but as you can see,
- [12:42] it's not actually logged in as me cuz I
- [12:44] didn't give it any sort of login
- [12:45] details. So, it got me like 90% of the
- [12:48] way there and then just wants me to, you
- [12:50] know, finish the rest of the order. Or I
- [12:52] can just give it information and it will
- [12:54] go and finish everything for me. One
- [12:56] thing that's kind of cool as well is I
- [12:57] can skim through here and watch it go
- [12:59] through this whole process. It's like a
- [13:01] 50inute step by step of everything it
- [13:03] did. We could see that it went to Open
- [13:05] Table and it reviewed a bunch of
- [13:07] restaurants and it went to Trip Advisor.
- [13:09] Tried to book a reservation here on Open
- [13:11] Table for me. Then it searched up on
- [13:13] Amazon and started looking for some
- [13:15] pants. It seems like it spent a lot of
- [13:17] time getting confused. The new search is
- [13:19] currently loading. The search results
- [13:20] have loaded. Now I'm waiting. I will
- [13:22] click the black color option. Like right
- [13:24] now it's not even showing Amazon on the
- [13:26] screen. It's still showing Open Table. I
- [13:28] don't know. It definitely is still
- [13:30] really buggy. So I feel like it's got
- [13:32] promise. It can go and operate a
- [13:34] browser. I didn't really feel like I got
- [13:37] a whole lot more out of this than I did
- [13:40] when I got the operator or using Manis
- [13:42] or something like that. But again, I
- [13:44] could give it sensitive information
- [13:47] where it could go and actually do this
- [13:48] stuff on my behalf. It always feels like
- [13:50] these things fall a little bit short
- [13:52] still. I just don't feel there yet where
- [13:55] I'm like really really excited by what
- [13:57] it can do. Again, I go back to the
- [13:59] example of like would this replace a
- [14:00] person? Like if I had an assistant going
- [14:02] out and doing the three things that I
- [14:03] assigned here, would I be happy with
- [14:05] what the assistant came back to me with?
- [14:07] Not really. But I do have a lot more
- [14:09] things I want to demo today. Some really
- [14:11] cool tools came out this week that I'm
- [14:12] excited to play with. So, let's go ahead
- [14:14] and move on. But before I move off of
- [14:15] OpenAI completely, OpenAI did release
- [14:18] their record mode this week. I actually
- [14:20] demoed that in a previous video. It's a
- [14:22] mode where let's say you're on a Zoom
- [14:24] call or you're watching YouTube videos
- [14:26] or you're doing anything where there's
- [14:27] audio coming from your computer, you can
- [14:30] actually record it with the chat GPT
- [14:32] desktop app on Mac and it will record
- [14:35] the whole thing. It doesn't necessarily
- [14:37] transcribe it. It's just afterwards
- [14:38] it'll give you like a summary. Again, I
- [14:40] showed that off in a previous video, but
- [14:41] now it's available to plus users as
- [14:43] well. It was previously only available
- [14:44] to pro users. But now let's shift away
- [14:46] from OpenAI and talk about Enthropic.
- [14:49] This week they rolled out this like tool
- [14:51] directory of all of these different
- [14:53] tools that you can use directly from
- [14:55] within Anthropic. We're introducing a
- [14:57] new directory of tools that connect
- [14:58] Claude which you can explore and try
- [15:00] with a single click. We're also
- [15:01] featuring new connectors built by our
- [15:03] partners to remote services like notion,
- [15:05] Canva, and Stripe and local desktop
- [15:07] applications like Figma, socket, and
- [15:09] Prisma. So you've got this Claude AI
- [15:12] directory here with both web connectors
- [15:14] and desktop extensions. So you've got
- [15:17] things like Asauna, Canva, Gmail, Google
- [15:20] Drive. A lot of these were already
- [15:21] connectors, but some new ones in here as
- [15:24] well. And then desktop extensions, which
- [15:26] could connect to things like Chrome, and
- [15:28] Brave, and Air Table, but I want to play
- [15:31] around with the Canva connection. Let's
- [15:34] try that. Let's add Canan Can Canva.
- [15:36] Let's add Canva. All right. So, it's
- [15:39] giving me errors whenever I try to
- [15:40] connect to Canva. So, maybe it's not
- [15:43] fully dialed in yet. Let's try it from
- [15:45] the settings page here instead of the
- [15:47] directory page. Connect. Yeah, I don't
- [15:49] know what's going on. It's not actually
- [15:50] letting me connect to Canva. Let me try
- [15:52] something else here. Let's try
- [15:53] connecting it to notion. Okay, so I get
- [15:55] an error when trying to connect it to
- [15:56] notion as well. For whatever reason, I
- [15:58] can't get these connectors to work at
- [15:59] all. Uh I'm using the Comet browser
- [16:01] right now. I actually just went over and
- [16:03] tried it in the Chrome browser. It
- [16:04] didn't work in the Chrome browser
- [16:06] either. So, that's kind of a bummer cuz
- [16:08] I really wanted to demo this, but at the
- [16:10] moment, the cloud connectors just aren't
- [16:13] working for me. If you're watching this
- [16:14] video and you see that I'm clearly doing
- [16:16] something wrong, please let me know.
- [16:18] I've tried multiple browsers now and it
- [16:21] just brings me to this page when I try
- [16:22] to connect. Bummer. We also got some
- [16:24] news out of Nvidia recently. They
- [16:27] launched their version 4.0 with the new
- [16:29] AI twin feature. This feature allows you
- [16:32] to upload videos of yourself and create
- [16:34] a digital clone of yourself or use one
- [16:38] of the pre-created avatars that they've
- [16:40] already got. So, check this out. Now, if
- [16:41] I log into my Nvidia account here and I
- [16:43] click on create AI video, there's a new
- [16:46] button here that says AI twins, I have
- [16:48] the option to create a twin from
- [16:50] YouTube, record fresh, or clone just my
- [16:53] voice. So, for this video, let's record
- [16:55] from scratch and create a fresh new
- [16:57] avatar. I'll click on recording to
- [16:59] avatar. It tells me to upload at least
- [17:01] 60 seconds of video and to make sure I
- [17:04] give Invidia AI permission with my words
- [17:06] in that video. So, I'm going to go ahead
- [17:08] and record that real quick and then
- [17:10] we'll go ahead and upload it and see
- [17:12] what happens. And after a little while,
- [17:14] I now have my custom AI avatar. And
- [17:17] what's really cool about these custom AI
- [17:18] avatars is that you can actually pair
- [17:20] them with products like my Glacio's
- [17:22] brand cereal here. If I come over to
- [17:24] brands and products, create a branded
- [17:26] product. I can upload my image, give it
- [17:27] some details, and then combine my avatar
- [17:30] with my product to create a video of my
- [17:34] avatar talking about that product.
- [17:36] Finally, a cereal that truly has zero
- [17:39] calories because you literally can't eat
- [17:41] it. This is Glacio's Glass Shard cereal.
- [17:44] Honestly, in videos, pretty great for
- [17:46] last minute re-shoots, creating simple
- [17:49] and fun ads, or just messing around cuz
- [17:52] sometimes that's fun, too. And you can
- [17:54] actually try this AI avatar feature for
- [17:56] free over at invido.io.
- [17:59] I will make sure it is linked up in the
- [18:01] description. And thank you so much to
- [18:03] Nvidia for sponsoring today's episode.
- [18:05] Now, let's get back to it. This company,
- [18:07] Hume AI, released something that I've
- [18:09] been hearing is really cool. I haven't
- [18:10] tested it myself yet, but I'm excited to
- [18:12] test it right now. They actually call it
- [18:14] personality cloning. So, think of like
- [18:16] 11 Labs where you can train it on your
- [18:19] own voice. Well, apparently Hume AI, you
- [18:21] can train it on your own voice, but it
- [18:22] also sort of picks up on your
- [18:23] personality and how you talk a little
- [18:26] bit as well. Hume's voice AI can now not
- [18:28] only mimic your voice but also speaking
- [18:30] style and language is now available via
- [18:33] our text to speech and new speechtoech
- [18:35] model EVI3 which is also launching
- [18:39] today. So let's go over to demo hume.ai.
- [18:42] Let's try clone your voice. Upload an
- [18:44] audio file. It works best with only 30
- [18:46] to 90 seconds of audio. That's not too
- [18:48] bad. Uh let's go ahead and click record
- [18:50] your voice. Hi, my name is Matt Wolf.
- [18:52] I'm a YouTuber. All right. So, I just
- [18:54] did a quick recording of me talking and
- [18:57] now it's processing. I don't know how
- [18:59] long this process is going to take, but
- [19:00] you do because it took about What's up?
- [19:02] It's awesome to connect with you. I'm
- [19:04] always excited to chat about what's
- [19:05] happening in the AI world.
- [19:07] >> So, it took about
- [19:08] >> Okay. Okay. Maybe you're just taking it
- [19:10] all in.
- [19:11] >> Can you shut up for a second?
- [19:12] >> That's totally cool. You know, sometimes
- [19:13] I find myself just What brings you here
- [19:15] today?
- [19:15] >> So, it took about 3. Oh my gosh. Still
- [19:18] over at the site. So, it took about 3
- [19:21] seconds to train and then it just starts
- [19:23] talking to you kind of annoyingly
- [19:25] actually. So, uh here's what it sounds
- [19:27] like. Let me unmute this site cuz it
- [19:29] just started talking. AI tools that
- [19:31] launched overnight. It's both exciting
- [19:33] and overwhelming at the same time.
- [19:34] >> Can you stop talking? You talk way too
- [19:36] much.
- [19:37] >> Whoa. Okay, got it. My bad. I can
- [19:39] definitely tone it down. What did you
- [19:41] want to talk about? All right. Uh why do
- [19:43] you keep talking? Why do you even need
- [19:44] to say things like uh ah yeah, I hear
- [19:47] you. That's fair. Sometimes the habit of
- [19:49] chatting just takes over, you know.
- [19:50] Look, I guess it's because I'm used to
- [19:52] making content, keeping things flowing,
- [19:54] filling the space. But you're right.
- [19:55] Sometimes less is more. So, what would
- [19:58] actually be helpful for you right now? I
- [20:00] would like it if you can be silent for
- [20:03] 10 seconds. Okay, silence for 10 seconds
- [20:06] starting now.
- [20:08] That was refreshing actually.
- [20:11] >> Thanks for calling that out.
- [20:12] >> One second. You stopped talking for one
- [20:14] second. Okay. So, are you supposed to
- [20:17] sound like me? Is this the voice that I
- [20:19] just trained? That sounds like my voice.
- [20:21] No, I'm not your voice or a clone of
- [20:24] your voice. I'm actually meant to speak
- [20:26] like Matt Wolf. You know, the the
- [20:28] YouTuber who runs Future Tools, so I've
- [20:30] got his style and way of talking about
- [20:32] AI stuff. What if I was to tell you that
- [20:34] I am Matt Wolf? Wait, what? You're
- [20:37] saying you are Matt Wolf?
- [20:39] >> I am Matt Wolf. Whoa. Seriously, you are
- [20:42] Matt Wolf?
- [20:43] >> Yes.
- [20:44] saying
- [20:45] >> pretty wild that my first real chat is
- [20:47] with the person I'm supposed to sound
- [20:48] like. How's it feeling from your end
- [20:51] hearing an AI version of yourself talk
- [20:53] back to you?
- [20:53] >> Well, a couple things.
- [20:54] >> And I'll be curious to see what the
- [20:56] YouTube audience thinks. I don't really
- [20:57] think you sound like me, but also like I
- [21:01] wish you wouldn't feel the need to
- [21:03] constantly talk all the time. Okay, I
- [21:04] hear you. Thanks for being straight up
- [21:06] about that. It's actually super helpful
- [21:08] feedback. I'll work on the constant
- [21:10] talking thing. Okay, so that was Hume.
- [21:14] That's what Hume AI does. It clones your
- [21:16] voice really, really quickly. Whether or
- [21:18] not that sounds super close to my voice,
- [21:20] I'm curious what you think. I don't
- [21:21] really think it does. I feel like 11
- [21:23] Labs might be a little bit closer, but
- [21:25] this one did sound like it has a little
- [21:27] bit more personality than like 11 Labs,
- [21:29] but man, the ability to not just be
- [21:31] quiet for like more than a half of a
- [21:34] second, I actually find to be kind of
- [21:35] annoying. But it is a cool app and I
- [21:37] think they'll get that dialed in. The
- [21:39] company Runway actually released
- [21:41] something pretty cool this week as well
- [21:42] called Act 2. And Act 2 is a motion
- [21:46] capture model where you can give it any
- [21:49] sort of animation. You can give it a
- [21:50] talking head and then sort of reskin it
- [21:53] however you want and then the video that
- [21:56] you gave it is sort of the driving video
- [21:58] for the animation. So let's jump in and
- [22:00] play with it. And I'll explain what I
- [22:02] mean. So with act 2, there's two ways.
- [22:04] You can either record a video or you can
- [22:07] upload a video. You also give it an
- [22:09] image and the image will follow whatever
- [22:12] sort of movements came from the video
- [22:14] that you gave it. So, let's start by
- [22:17] recording a quick video here. I'll click
- [22:18] record. Film yourself from the waist up
- [22:21] and I'll do some like motion and stuff
- [22:23] as we do this. Hey everyone, you should
- [22:25] really subscribe to Matt Wolf and also
- [22:28] check out the website Future Tools. All
- [22:30] right, so we'll use that video and we
- [22:32] can upload a character or we can use one
- [22:34] of the sample characters. Just for fun
- [22:35] on this one, I'm going to use one of
- [22:37] these sample characters. Let's do this
- [22:39] buff gem guy here. And let's generate
- [22:42] and see what it comes up with. Hey
- [22:44] everyone, you should really subscribe to
- [22:46] Matt Wolf. And also check out the
- [22:48] website Future Tools. Hands are massive,
- [22:51] but I mean it followed my moves and
- [22:54] stuff. So just for fun, I went and
- [22:55] generated an image in Leonardo of like
- [22:57] an astronaut on a space station with
- [22:59] their helmet off. So we'll replace this
- [23:01] image here. Hey everyone, you should
- [23:03] really subscribe to Matt Wolf and also
- [23:05] check out the website Future Tools. And
- [23:08] also, if you subscribe, that makes me
- [23:11] feel good. And I just like to move and
- [23:14] do stuff like this because I want to see
- [23:17] how the animation comes out. I mean,
- [23:20] it's not bad. I don't really think the
- [23:22] lip-s syncing is that great, but the
- [23:23] actual motion of the hands translates
- [23:26] pretty well. So, I want to test
- [23:27] something else. So, I want to test how
- [23:28] it does with more of like a full body
- [23:30] animation. So, I have this little video
- [23:32] here of me like playing in my office
- [23:34] with a sword that I recorded. And then I
- [23:36] jumped over to Leonardo and I generated
- [23:38] an image of a guy holding a lightsaber,
- [23:40] an image of a pirate holding a sword,
- [23:42] and then some images of a guy holding a
- [23:45] fish cuz I want to see what happens with
- [23:47] a guy holding a fish. So, I generated
- [23:49] all of these and we'll use these images
- [23:52] as our driving image here. We'll start
- [23:54] with our Jedi and then I'll generate
- [23:56] each one of those images with this same
- [23:58] initial driving video and see how they
- [24:01] come out. So, here's our Jedi video. I
- [24:03] mean, it kind of added an extra sword in
- [24:06] there, but I was Oh my god, I just
- [24:08] stabbed myself in the face. Here's our
- [24:09] pirate video. He's got his sword. He's
- [24:11] kind of swinging it around, but it's
- [24:12] kind of duplicating itself weirdly. Now,
- [24:14] it's just floating and I had three
- [24:16] hands.
- [24:18] So, I mean, I think it's getting like
- [24:20] the motion of my face, but it's not
- [24:22] really paying attention to like my
- [24:24] little toy lightsaber that I have in my
- [24:25] hand. It kind of is ignoring what's
- [24:27] going on with that and doing its own
- [24:29] thing. But yeah, what's it going to do
- [24:31] with the fish? Let's find out. Yeah. So,
- [24:32] the fish is just like sitting on the
- [24:34] guy's lap while the hands are moving
- [24:36] around. Now, there's an extra hand in
- [24:38] the fish. I mean, I wanted to find out
- [24:40] what would happen. I want to figure out
- [24:41] these tools breaking points. And I guess
- [24:43] right now it's not great at noticing the
- [24:45] actual sword in my hand. It's more like
- [24:46] paying attention to the facial
- [24:48] expressions and what's going on sort of
- [24:50] above the neck. But still really really
- [24:51] fun to play with. This company Deart
- [24:54] released something interesting this week
- [24:55] called Mirage LSD. Now the LSD stands
- [24:58] for live stream diffusion. And what it
- [25:01] is is it actually changes the video. It
- [25:04] like sort of reskins the video that
- [25:06] you're seeing in real time. And I can
- [25:08] actually be talking into my camera and
- [25:10] it will reskin it however I want. I do
- [25:12] think this LSD is intentional because
- [25:15] well, check this out. Let's click on try
- [25:17] Mirage. I'll go ahead and give it access
- [25:18] to my camera. So now it can see my
- [25:20] camera and it says model warming up. Oh,
- [25:22] now it just reskin me and everything
- [25:25] you're seeing is in real time. So it's
- [25:28] reskinned as well frozen wonderland. Now
- [25:31] it just changed to Versailles Palace and
- [25:34] it's still me. I still got my
- [25:35] microphone. I don't know what this is on
- [25:37] my microphone. Like is there some skin
- [25:39] there on my microphone? You can see now
- [25:41] why it's called LSD, I think, because
- [25:43] the LSD might have a little bit of a
- [25:45] double meaning. Now I feel like I'm in
- [25:46] Minecraft. No, BlockCraft. Sorry, this
- [25:48] is Blockcraft. Now it's midnight and
- [25:50] it's just sort of rotating through these
- [25:52] different effects as I play here. Uh, I
- [25:55] can click on anime and manually make it
- [25:57] rotate. But, uh, you know, hold up my
- [26:00] water bottle and that does not look like
- [26:02] a water bottle anymore. And as you can
- [26:04] see, this is all happening in real time.
- [26:06] Let's go to yarn world. Now it turned me
- [26:08] into yarn. And there's some uh yarn
- [26:12] guitars back here. Uh pretty cool. Let's
- [26:14] see. Type a world idea. Let's try this.
- [26:17] What kind of world idea? Goo world. Give
- [26:20] me goo world. And this is what goo world
- [26:22] looks like. Um let's say um balloon
- [26:25] animals. And literally I'm just giving
- [26:27] it text prompts. And it is changing my
- [26:30] environment and my video. And I am still
- [26:33] able to do things in real time as it
- [26:35] reskins. And let's just type zombies.
- [26:37] It's pretty quick, too. It changes over
- [26:39] to this uh Oh, that's creepy. It changes
- [26:42] over to this like other world, this
- [26:45] other reskin really, really quickly.
- [26:48] [Laughter]
- [26:50] But it's just fun. This is just really
- [26:52] fun. Some of the ideas that they talked
- [26:55] about this being used for is like in
- [26:57] games. It showed off demos of people
- [27:00] playing firsterson shooters and then
- [27:02] reskinning it. So, they're running
- [27:04] around shooting zombies instead of it
- [27:06] being a World War II game. So, some
- [27:08] really interesting ideas and I'm looking
- [27:10] forward to seeing how this one plays out
- [27:12] a little bit. Adobe Firefly rolled out a
- [27:15] new audio feature that allows you to
- [27:16] generate sound effects from your own
- [27:19] voice. So, if you log into Adobe
- [27:21] Firefly, you can see this new voice to
- [27:24] sound effects. And if we go in here, we
- [27:26] can actually record our voice. Let's do
- [27:28] like a a lion growling. So, let's go
- [27:31] ahead and give our prompt and then we'll
- [27:32] record our voice. Raar
- [27:36] and it gives us a few variations.
- [27:39] And it used my initial voice for like
- [27:43] the timing of it, but then it
- [27:44] regenerated as the thing I asked for.
- [27:47] So, where this is helpful is let's say
- [27:49] you're doing like a a textto video
- [27:51] generator with Halo AI or something like
- [27:53] that and there's no audio over it, but
- [27:56] you want to give it a sound effect of
- [27:58] like a lion roaring because maybe it's a
- [27:59] video of a lion. Well, I can actually
- [28:01] sync it up by watching the video roaring
- [28:04] at the time I see the video roar and
- [28:06] then overlay that audio so the timing
- [28:08] lines up perfectly. So, some people
- [28:10] might find that pretty cool and helpful.
- [28:12] Here's something that I've almost sort
- [28:14] of been dreading demoing. I actually
- [28:16] have not played with this yet myself, so
- [28:18] this is going to be my first time trying
- [28:19] it, but XAI just released a AI
- [28:23] companion. And there's two companions.
- [28:25] There's Annie, and there's also like
- [28:28] this little dude called Rudy. And this
- [28:30] Annie has a not safe for work mode. You
- [28:33] can actually make her wearing lingerie
- [28:36] and well have not safe for work
- [28:38] conversations. I'm going to keep it PG,
- [28:41] but I'm going to try this for the first
- [28:42] time here. As soon as I open the Grock
- [28:44] app on my phone, the very first thing I
- [28:46] see at the very top is meet Annie and
- [28:48] Rudy. So, let's go ahead and click on
- [28:49] that. And of course, the first time I
- [28:51] ever tried to use this feature, their
- [28:54] servers are overloaded. It doesn't seems
- [28:56] to be working. Hello. Hello. Can you
- [28:59] hear me? Is anything happening? Annie,
- [29:01] why won't you talk to me? Yeah, the Gro
- [29:03] app is apparently overloaded. So, I
- [29:06] mean, a lot of people are trying to chat
- [29:08] with Annie right now. I probably not a
- [29:10] good signal for the future of humanity.
- [29:13] Sorry, Annie. I was really hoping to
- [29:14] chat with you, but it's probably for the
- [29:16] best. As with most weeks in the AI
- [29:18] world, we got some fresh drama this
- [29:20] week.
- [29:25] Last week, we talked about this whole
- [29:27] weird thing unfolding with Windsurf. So,
- [29:29] OpenAI was trying to buy Windourf, but
- [29:33] there was drama because Microsoft owns
- [29:36] VS Code and Microsoft also has the
- [29:39] rights to any IP that OpenAI has. So if
- [29:43] OpenAI purchased Windinsurf, which is an
- [29:45] integrated development environment or
- [29:48] basically an app that you write code in,
- [29:50] if OpenAI acquired Windsurf, then
- [29:52] Microsoft also gets access to Windsurf
- [29:55] and they could theoretically roll all
- [29:57] the features from Windsurf into VS Code
- [30:00] and VS Code was a fork of Windsurf and
- [30:04] Windsurf was a fork of VS Code in the
- [30:06] first place. So there was some like
- [30:08] weird conflicts there. What?
- [30:11] >> And a lot of us thought that OpenAI was
- [30:13] just going to acquire Windsurf and then
- [30:15] they would figure it out with Microsoft
- [30:17] somehow. But then we got news that well
- [30:19] the top brass over at Windsurf jumped
- [30:21] ship from Windsurf and are now working
- [30:23] over at Google DeepMind. And so
- [30:25] everybody's like, well, what does that
- [30:27] mean for Windsurf if their CEO and some
- [30:29] of their top people all left and went to
- [30:31] DeepMind? Well, what ended up happening
- [30:32] next was even more surprising. Even
- [30:35] though the CEO and some of the top
- [30:36] people at Windsurf jump shipped to Deep
- [30:38] Mind, Windinssurf got acquired by
- [30:40] Cognition, the company that makes Devon,
- [30:43] which is another AI coding app. And it's
- [30:46] all just kind of crazy. And I'm not
- [30:48] going to break it all down. There's a
- [30:49] lot of intricacies and nuance. There's a
- [30:51] really good YouTube channel called Theo
- [30:53] GG and he's done a couple of really
- [30:57] excellent breakdowns about this whole
- [30:59] wind surf, OpenAI, Google Deep Mind,
- [31:02] Cognition sort of love square. So check
- [31:05] out his videos cuz he breaks it down
- [31:06] really well. All right, I have a few
- [31:08] last little things I want to share with
- [31:10] you. Some of you may find interesting
- [31:11] that's happening in the AI world. So
- [31:13] let's jump into a rapid firew.
- [31:16] [Music]
- [31:19] This week, Google rolled out an AI
- [31:21] powered business calling feature where
- [31:23] Google will make calls to companies on
- [31:25] your behalf. The new business calling
- [31:27] feature uses AI to call local businesses
- [31:29] on your behalf to collect information
- [31:31] about availability and pricing. The idea
- [31:33] behind the feature is to help you access
- [31:34] information without having to actually
- [31:36] pick up the phone and talk to somebody.
- [31:38] I mean, Jet Alpha is going to love that.
- [31:40] It says, "To get started, you need to
- [31:41] search for something like pet groomers
- [31:43] near me, and you'll see a new option in
- [31:45] the results to have AI check pricing.
- [31:47] From there, you answer a couple
- [31:48] questions to receive information about
- [31:49] appointments and services from different
- [31:52] local businesses. All right, I'll bite.
- [31:53] Let's go to Google and say pet groomers
- [31:56] near me. And I don't know if it's
- [31:57] because I'm recording this at night and
- [31:58] none of these places are going to be
- [32:00] open right now or if because I just
- [32:02] don't have that feature yet, but uh
- [32:04] yeah, that's not showing up for me. But
- [32:06] I imagine it will soon. There's a new AI
- [32:08] model that got released this past week
- [32:10] that actually has people freaking out
- [32:12] quite a bit. This new model is called
- [32:14] Kimmy K2, and it's a very similar moment
- [32:18] to when Deepseek R1 dropped several
- [32:21] months ago, and people are just blown
- [32:23] away by this Chinese model that's also
- [32:25] open source. If we look at the LM Arena
- [32:28] that sort of ranks models based on blind
- [32:31] user testing, this Kimmy K2 model
- [32:35] actually falls in fifth place, right up
- [32:37] there with pretty close scores to the
- [32:40] rest of these. I mean, for context,
- [32:42] DeepSeek R1 is, you know, several slots
- [32:46] below it. And I guess there was some
- [32:48] sort of new like training method on how
- [32:50] they actually trained this model that
- [32:52] really has people impressed. My buddy
- [32:53] Matthew Burman did a little bit of a
- [32:55] breakdown on it, showing off this graph
- [32:57] right here, which I don't really
- [32:59] understand. It's a little bit more
- [33:00] technical than I like to get into, uh,
- [33:03] but saying that the way that this was
- [33:04] sort of trained was really sort of
- [33:08] groundbreaking. And so definitely check
- [33:09] out Matthew's video if you want to learn
- [33:11] more about what's going on with Kimmy
- [33:13] K2. But it seems like it's another one
- [33:15] of those sort of deepseek R1, oh my
- [33:18] gosh, they're catching up. Their open
- [33:20] source is doing really, really cool
- [33:21] things right now sort of moment.
- [33:23] Enthropic also released Claude for
- [33:25] financial services. So if you're like a
- [33:27] financial analyst, this new model helps
- [33:30] you analyze stuff. Cloud 4 model
- [33:33] outperforms other frontier models as
- [33:35] research agents across financial tasks
- [33:37] in Val's AI's finance agent benchmark.
- [33:40] So if you work in finance and you want
- [33:43] an AI model specifically designed for
- [33:45] you, this clot for financial services is
- [33:47] probably one to check out. The French
- [33:49] company Mistl got a deep research mode
- [33:52] inside of their model. So if you head
- [33:54] over to mistrol.ai, come up to products
- [33:56] and then go to le chat, they now have a
- [33:59] research button. Now you do have to be
- [34:01] logged in. It doesn't show it if you're
- [34:02] not logged in, but you can use this
- [34:05] research on the free plan. You get up to
- [34:07] five deep researches a month. Now, this
- [34:10] deep research is similar to the deep
- [34:11] research you're going to get out of chat
- [34:13] GPT. Maybe not as indepth as the one you
- [34:16] get out of Google Gemini, but if you've
- [34:18] used any of these other deep researches,
- [34:20] well, it's similar. We now have it in
- [34:22] Mistrol. Since we're on the topic of
- [34:23] Mistral, they also released Voxrol this
- [34:26] week, which is actually a pretty
- [34:28] impressive, helpful tool. Voxil is a
- [34:32] audio to text generator or speechtoext
- [34:35] generator that can actually create
- [34:36] transcriptions for you similar to what
- [34:38] you get out of whisper and assembly AI
- [34:41] and tools like that. However, it is
- [34:43] really inexpensive. So, we can see on
- [34:46] this graph here, these are the various
- [34:48] speech to text models. When you look at
- [34:50] the price along the bottom here, Voxil
- [34:52] costs onetenth of a penny per minute.
- [34:55] So, if you want to transcribe an
- [34:57] hour-ong podcast, for instance, it'll
- [34:59] cost you 6 cents. Although, I don't know
- [35:02] if that math really matters cuz
- [35:03] according to this article, Mr. says
- [35:05] Voxrol can transcribe up to 30 minutes
- [35:07] of audio. So, you could transcribe up to
- [35:10] like half hour podcast, I guess, and
- [35:12] it'll cost you three pennies. Again,
- [35:14] still useful if you're trying to
- [35:15] transcribe and you want it as cheap as
- [35:17] possible. And then finally, Amazon
- [35:20] released Kira this week and this is
- [35:23] another IDE. So similar to cursor or
- [35:26] wind surf or github copilot or tools
- [35:29] like that where you can write code hero
- [35:32] is along the same lines. I believe it's
- [35:34] also another fork of visual studio code
- [35:37] from Microsoft. But this one is designed
- [35:40] to sort of pre-plan your projects before
- [35:43] you get into the coding. And supposedly
- [35:44] that's sort of the big value proposition
- [35:46] of this Kuro app is it will game plan
- [35:50] the entire project and really really go
- [35:52] into details and map out the whole
- [35:54] project first and then once it's mapped
- [35:56] out then it moves into the developing
- [35:58] phase and you start working with it to
- [36:00] code out what you already mapped out. So
- [36:03] it sort of takes a different approach
- [36:04] and supposedly it's pretty good. I
- [36:06] haven't played with it yet but I wanted
- [36:08] to make you aware that it was available.
- [36:10] So, if you're looking for another sort
- [36:12] of AI based coding app, well, Kuro's
- [36:15] another one that maybe you can try. And
- [36:17] that's it. That's what I got for you
- [36:18] this week. A lot of fun demos, a lot of
- [36:20] fun stuff to play with. But, thank you
- [36:22] so much for tuning in. My goal with this
- [36:24] channel is to share the stuff that I
- [36:27] think the most people would be
- [36:28] interested in. My goal is let's get in,
- [36:32] see what we can do this week that we
- [36:34] couldn't do last week, play with some of
- [36:35] the tools, see if we could break some of
- [36:37] the tools and have fun with them, and
- [36:39] show you what AI is capable of right now
- [36:42] in this current state. That's my goal.
- [36:44] Hopefully, I did that for you.
- [36:45] Hopefully, you feel more looped in and
- [36:47] uh can make some better decisions about
- [36:49] whether or not you want to jump on board
- [36:50] some of these tools or not. So, thank
- [36:52] you so much for tuning in. I really,
- [36:54] really appreciate you. If you like
