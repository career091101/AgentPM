- [00:06] thanks for joining today's last session
- [00:08] and uh and thanks for staying with me
- [00:10] before all the parties wines and drinks
- [00:14] yeah um and uh uh we know that ji is
- [00:19] reshipping everything inside of your
- [00:22] organization and yes it's happening
- [00:24] inside of snowflake too um I'm here to
- [00:27] talk about how this Advanced technique
- [00:30] is making a big difference here in
- [00:32] Snowflake hope you can get inspired so
- [00:34] that you can find similar opportunities
- [00:36] in your organization and for those who
- [00:39] are not familiar with snowflake have
- [00:41] have you ever used snowflake please
- [00:42] raise a hand oh nice nice nice for those
- [00:46] who are not familiar with snowflake uh
- [00:48] we are a data Cloud platform that uh
- [00:51] help organizations to run large scale
- [00:54] analytics uh create custom applications
- [00:57] and also uh build a native AI Solutions
- [01:01] and uh and my name is Ean I'm the data
- [01:04] scientist uh in sales analytics team and
- [01:08] my role is all about helping sales
- [01:10] people leverage data um to help them to
- [01:13] work smarter and more efficiently and
- [01:16] also another big shout out to my
- [01:18] colleague we H uh who is currently on
- [01:21] vacation so no complain there so she's
- [01:24] missing out this phone party she's also
- [01:26] played a big part in on today's topic
- [01:30] okay let's get started so what I'm going
- [01:32] to talk about today um basically we're
- [01:35] going to talk about a tool is called
- [01:37] sales data assistant that we build for
- [01:40] sales team to for them to interactive
- [01:42] with their data basically chat with
- [01:45] their data um so uh they can get access
- [01:48] to customer related metrics or some
- [01:51] business performance data and also it
- [01:54] has another cool features is it can help
- [01:57] Sal people to handle certain task and I
- [02:00] will going to show some like video demos
- [02:03] at the end of the presentation so that
- [02:05] you can know uh what look
- [02:07] like Okay cool so for uh today's agenda
- [02:11] first we will talk about uh how we start
- [02:15] why we build this tool what's our goal
- [02:17] and second I will work you through some
- [02:20] uh requirements both Technical and
- [02:22] non-technical before when we start
- [02:25] building the app and next I will talk
- [02:28] about the high level archit architecture
- [02:30] and how we structured everything
- [02:32] together and second is I will show you
- [02:35] guys how it looks and we will for sure
- [02:37] leave some time for Q&A um but if just
- [02:41] in case we're running shorter time I'm
- [02:43] happy to answer any questions after
- [02:45] today's
- [02:46] session cool let's get started so but
- [02:49] before we dive in let's take a step back
- [02:52] to talk about how we started and why we
- [02:54] need this tool um and here and our goal
- [02:57] is to democratize data basically to make
- [03:01] data easy to access for everyone in
- [03:03] sales organization and sometimes um not
- [03:06] sometimes we always find that for those
- [03:09] people who make the decisions are the
- [03:11] people not actually the data expert so
- [03:15] that as a result we will see that they
- [03:17] may uh do not have access to the data or
- [03:21] they uh they don't know how to write
- [03:22] write query or SQL to pull the data or
- [03:26] they just spend a lot of time navigating
- [03:28] through different Dash board to find the
- [03:30] metric that think that that they think
- [03:32] is correct so that is where our tool
- [03:35] comes in um and we want to make sure
- [03:38] that um the whole process can be quicker
- [03:41] and faster so for salese they don't need
- [03:44] actual steps to get the data they need
- [03:47] so with the tool we hope that um it can
- [03:51] they can chat with the data they can ask
- [03:53] any question they want for example about
- [03:55] their customers or about their
- [03:57] territories or even their teams
- [04:00] performance and uh things doesn't stop
- [04:03] there uh we also hope that this uh
- [04:05] chatbot this data assistant can help uh
- [04:09] and help them with some like everyday
- [04:11] simple task for example uh when sales
- [04:13] people want to update something directly
- [04:16] to Salesforce in this case they don't
- [04:18] need to jump into different system they
- [04:20] can just interactive with the DAT
- [04:22] assistant and then assistant can help
- [04:24] them to finish this workflow so at the
- [04:27] end of day it's all about helping salese
- [04:31] to get data easily and streamlining
- [04:34] their work so that they can focus on
- [04:36] what really matters uh for example close
- [04:39] the deal or manage the customer
- [04:41] relationship right and uh here are I'm
- [04:45] going to show you like some uh
- [04:48] requirements both Technical and
- [04:49] non-technical when we start building the
- [04:52] app um first let's look at it from the
- [04:55] uh users perspective uh let's think what
- [04:58] kind of tool do you want to use every
- [05:00] day um in our opinion I think it should
- [05:02] be easy to use fast accurate and secure
- [05:06] um so and those are the four M pillars
- [05:08] that gued at when we're developing the
- [05:11] tool and on the other hand is the
- [05:14] technical building blocks those are the
- [05:16] key building blocks we're focused on
- [05:18] when we developing the tool first is the
- [05:21] text to SQL cuz uh uh we are a data
- [05:25] platform and all the informations are
- [05:26] stored in Snowflake database so when
- [05:29] need to leverage and using LM to uh
- [05:32] query the data and then send uh the
- [05:35] correct data to our non- technical users
- [05:38] and um to be honest the T to sqle is a
- [05:41] really big one for us uh and we spend a
- [05:44] lot of time on this and the second
- [05:47] building block is data to text what does
- [05:50] this mean is after we get a query um and
- [05:53] we will run a query it will give us
- [05:55] output basically is the data and we also
- [05:58] want to find a way to translate the data
- [06:00] into a natural Language summary so that
- [06:02] the non-technical uh users can uh can
- [06:06] understand it more easily with a simple
- [06:08] and clear taex response so that's the
- [06:11] data to text and uh the the last
- [06:15] building block here is the AI agent uh
- [06:18] we want to use the agent to help us to
- [06:21] handle the task completion functionality
- [06:24] by using LM and uh once user send us a
- [06:28] request it can go into our set of tools
- [06:31] and to select the right functions or the
- [06:33] right tools to call for users request so
- [06:38] that's uh that's uh all about the
- [06:41] technical and non-technical requirements
- [06:43] we focused
- [06:45] on uh cool uh here is um how we put
- [06:50] everything together how did we structure
- [06:54] our data assistant uh first let's look
- [06:57] at this uh this this part is our UI we
- [07:00] we are using streamlet to build our user
- [07:04] interface we want to provide a very uh a
- [07:07] chity like experience for our users so
- [07:10] they can easily ask questions and then
- [07:12] get response and for those who are not
- [07:15] familiar with streamlet uh streamlet is
- [07:17] a opsource uh python uh framework that
- [07:21] allow all the data teams to build an
- [07:24] interactive app with just fuel Feliz of
- [07:27] python code yeah and uh after the user
- [07:32] uh ask a question we will first send it
- [07:35] to the semantic clear uh what semantic
- [07:38] clear you can think it as of knowledge
- [07:41] base for our large language model it
- [07:44] stored all the informations that we want
- [07:48] the LM to know um for example the
- [07:51] summary of the tables some correct
- [07:54] textle examples and all the functions
- [07:57] that can help the users to have handle
- [07:59] the task or the useful useful tips and
- [08:04] once user asks something the assistant
- [08:07] will go to this semantic C and search
- [08:09] for the most relevant information so it
- [08:12] can be the top tables that related to
- [08:14] the questions or some uh accurate good
- [08:17] uh correct textle examples and after we
- [08:21] get all the relevant information we will
- [08:23] then combine it with the prompts uh
- [08:26] where includes uh the system instr
- [08:29] instuctions basically uh how we are
- [08:32] guiding the the large language model to
- [08:34] finish a Tex Tex to SQL task and also
- [08:38] top table schema together with the chat
- [08:40] history and combining um the the
- [08:44] information with f from slear and
- [08:47] prompts we will send it to our the large
- [08:49] language
- [08:50] model and the large language model will
- [08:53] then give us a response the response is
- [08:55] a SQL um and it comes to the the the the
- [09:00] next step is called validation and in my
- [09:03] opinion I think that's the most critical
- [09:05] steps for our app uh because building a
- [09:08] chot is very easy but building a
- [09:11] reliable chot is a different story so in
- [09:14] this steps uh we applied different
- [09:17] approach here uh first we've allow the
- [09:20] LM itself to validate the SQ qu it
- [09:23] generates actually have been really
- [09:26] helpful and additionally uh our team
- [09:29] came together uh valid manually
- [09:31] validated over uh thousands of tax to
- [09:34] SQL response um and then we we polished
- [09:38] the prompts uh based on the based on all
- [09:42] the data we
- [09:43] got and over the time those uh validated
- [09:47] tax toq response has become our golden
- [09:49] standard and now we're thinking to uh
- [09:52] automate the whole validation process to
- [09:55] Leverage The Golden standard data set we
- [09:57] already have okay so after we get a
- [10:00] validated uh C we will then do some
- [10:03] testing and then send back to snowflake
- [10:06] to execute the query which will give us
- [10:09] a data basically a data frame as output
- [10:13] and it comes finally come to the N the
- [10:16] last step is uh convert the data to text
- [10:20] we want to translate the data into a
- [10:24] natural Language summary and here we're
- [10:26] using snowflake cortex on
- [10:30] um and uh here is a key that when you
- [10:33] when we using CeX LM everything stays
- [10:37] completely within snowflake U we're not
- [10:40] sending all the data to the close Source
- [10:42] model or no all everything is within
- [10:45] Snowflake and everything is secure and
- [10:48] well managed and once uh we got a
- [10:51] response we will send it back to the
- [10:53] Streamline app and the users will see
- [10:56] the answers and the users are also able
- [11:00] to give us some feedback and the
- [11:02] feedback can also send back to us and
- [11:04] we'll feed into the validation ongoing
- [11:07] validation process so that we can uh
- [11:10] always improving the whole systems and
- [11:13] also we're uh tracking we're also
- [11:15] tracking the user feedbacks because we
- [11:17] want to understand uh the overall
- [11:19] satisfication rate yeah hopefully that's
- [11:23] not too much information on one slides
- [11:26] yeah so I'm moving forward and here are
- [11:30] some like snowflake uh features that EMP
- [11:34] powering us to build a data assistant
- [11:37] first uh is the streamlet just like I
- [11:39] mentioned before uh streamlets provide a
- [11:42] userfriendly front end for the users to
- [11:45] easily interactive with our data
- [11:48] assistant and on the other hand I think
- [11:51] as a app developer it's also very user
- [11:54] friendly CU When building an interactive
- [11:58] app with streamlet there's only minimal
- [12:00] set up low com low maintenance and it
- [12:04] works perfectly with Snowflake and all
- [12:07] the cool features that snowflake
- [12:09] provides yeah that's the streamlet and
- [12:11] also uh other components are one is the
- [12:15] cortex
- [12:17] LM uh for those who are not familiar
- [12:19] with snowflake cortex LM so what's that
- [12:22] uh snowfl cortex LM is a set of AI
- [12:26] features that using large language model
- [12:28] to help the users to understand their
- [12:31] data uh answer questions or provide some
- [12:35] smart assistance and with uh cortex LM
- [12:39] uh everyone can easily get access to the
- [12:41] industry leading large large language
- [12:44] model like Mr Large llama uh Etc yeah
- [12:48] and with uh snowfl CeX LM everything is
- [12:52] uh culous what that this mean is as a
- [12:55] user when you call the function you
- [12:57] don't need to deal with all the complic
- [12:59] ated infrastructure cuz snowflake
- [13:01] already handled everything for you so
- [13:03] that's uh cortex snowflake cortex LM and
- [13:06] what we are using here is we are using
- [13:09] complete function uh under the cortex LM
- [13:12] uh which leverage the Mr Large language
- [13:15] model for natural language understanding
- [13:18] and response generation also the
- [13:20] embedding model and under the cortex LM
- [13:23] help us to build the uh knowledge the
- [13:26] knowledge based semantic here there also
- [13:29] help the assistant to Fat the most
- [13:31] relevant information from the knowledge
- [13:34] base okay so that's about the CeX LM and
- [13:39] the last snow components is snow park
- [13:43] UDF uh UDF stands for user defined
- [13:46] function um and here what snow park UDF
- [13:49] did is it uh it allow us to run and uh
- [13:54] run and create a customed uh python code
- [13:58] inside of snow
- [14:00] maybe some of you know like uh you can
- [14:02] write SQL in Snowflake but by using UDF
- [14:05] you can write python in snowfl so it
- [14:08] help us to automate some workflow like
- [14:10] push some update directly to another
- [14:12] system um and you can build all kinds of
- [14:15] uh data workflow using snow park UDF so
- [14:19] with streamlet cortex LM snow park Al
- [14:23] together we we have everything we need
- [14:26] to make the uh data assistant powerful
- [14:30] uh fast and easy to
- [14:34] use cool now let's take a look at how it
- [14:38] looks in real life uh actually prior to
- [14:41] the uh data assistant last year uh
- [14:45] November we already launched our first
- [14:48] tax to SQL applications for our sales
- [14:51] team and which only uh allow users to
- [14:55] ask one question at a time and com and
- [14:59] finish the task tax to SQL and then
- [15:02] after we get the results we can do some
- [15:05] charts uh based on what kind of data we
- [15:08] have yeah and this applications have
- [15:11] been super popular among our sales team
- [15:14] and we've received a lot of good
- [15:17] feedbacks which uh motivate motivate us
- [15:20] to keep moving and improving and some
- [15:23] status I want to share is like since
- [15:25] last year November U this uh application
- [15:29] already answered over 10,000 questions
- [15:32] and the adoption rate is very high over
- [15:36] 80% of of our sales users they all come
- [15:39] here to ask some questions to help them
- [15:41] to with to ask any question related to
- [15:44] their customers and also for the
- [15:46] cerfication rate is it's over like
- [15:50] 95% and moving forward it comes to uh
- [15:54] this year this year we've start building
- [15:56] the data assistant which basically uh we
- [16:01] build something on top of the taex to
- [16:04] SQL applications I just show you um by
- [16:07] adding uh by adding a data to text uh
- [16:11] building block and also adding the task
- [16:15] completion functionality also create a
- [16:18] more uh interactive Chabot for the users
- [16:21] so as you can see here is like we're
- [16:23] asking questions about their forecast
- [16:26] numbers about their opportunities
- [16:29] uh so on so forth and actually the the
- [16:32] response time is is not that bad it's
- [16:35] still enter developing and we hope we
- [16:38] can uh move this um product into
- [16:40] production next
- [16:43] quarter okay moving forward uh like I
- [16:47] mentioned before like another cool
- [16:49] feature that our toour data system
- [16:52] provide is um T it can help sales people
- [16:56] to execute some task what do this mean
- [16:59] is uh like let's think about you a
- [17:02] salesperson and when you're interactive
- [17:05] with our data assistant if you find some
- [17:08] data is outdated or you need to update
- [17:10] so at this time you can use the uh
- [17:13] system to help you to update data and
- [17:16] here what we're going what we're doing
- [17:18] here we are trying to update uh an
- [17:21] account uh Global 200 ranking uh and we
- [17:24] want to push it directly to Salesforce
- [17:27] and uh all the number here are dami data
- [17:30] we just want to show you how it works so
- [17:32] in the back end how it works is uh we
- [17:35] will we stored a lot of a lot of tools
- [17:37] that we collaborate with it team they
- [17:40] they are like reverse CTL help you to
- [17:43] push the update into different systems
- [17:46] so when user ask a question the agent
- [17:48] will help us to pick the most relevant
- [17:52] tools and and then ROM that function now
- [17:56] here is like uh it looks like it
- [17:57] finished the task let's say how it looks
- [18:00] like in Salesforce previously I think is
- [18:03] minus two right now it should be minus
- [18:05] one yeah so the you can see that we can
- [18:08] use you don't need to bounce into
- [18:10] different systems by by working with the
- [18:13] assistant you can make any update you
- [18:17] want okay so uh I think uh it's almost
- [18:22] at the end of this session so for for
- [18:25] what what's next I think the most
- [18:27] important is accuracy accuracy and
- [18:29] accuracy um like I said before building
- [18:33] a childb easy but building accurate but
- [18:35] reliable one is not and also another
- [18:38] another requirements we're thinking
- [18:40] right now is scalability because uh with
- [18:42] a growing number of users and increasing
- [18:45] data volumes we want we want to find a
- [18:47] way can smoothly handle everything also
- [18:50] we want to apply this this
- [18:53] infrastructure into other teams data and
- [18:58] uh with think that the future is super
- [19:00] exciting because every day there's are
- [19:01] new things coming out whenever it is new
- [19:04] models new Frameworks or new tools and
- [19:07] we're just ready to jump on to these
- [19:09] opportunities and keep improving there's
- [19:11] just so much potential ahead and we're
- [19:13] just at the beginning uh and also uh
- [19:17] last is a quick recap for today uh what
- [19:20] we just talk about is like uh what's our
- [19:23] goal our goal is to reimaging analytics
- [19:25] with geni to make data easy to access
- [19:28] for everyone and what the building
- [19:30] blocks we we mentioned the non-technical
- [19:32] and Technical non-technical includes
- [19:34] easy to use fast secure and the
- [19:38] technical side uh we think about like
- [19:40] tax to SQL data to tax and AI agent also
- [19:43] there's are a lot of uh there's are some
- [19:46] cool snowflake features help us to build
- [19:49] a tool like streamlet uh snow snowfl
- [19:52] cortex and also Snow Park UDF and at the
- [19:56] end uh we saw a few uh quick video on
- [19:59] how it looks so like I said it's just
- [20:01] beginning uh we're super excited to
- [20:03] where we can take this next okay thank
- [20:06] you so
- [20:09] much thank you you for the presentation
- [20:12] on empowering sales with LM powered um
- [20:17] data Insight Data Insights and um
- [20:20] workflow
- [20:21] automation sorry and workflow automation
- [20:24] excellent so we have time for a few
- [20:26] questions we have uh
- [20:29] shazar and kica in the
- [20:34] back so they're they're going to so
- [20:37] they're going to walk around with my
- [20:42] microphones um yeah I was curious what
- [20:45] were some of the questions that uh users
- [20:48] would try to ask but the system like in
- [20:51] the current state like really struggles
- [20:52] with I think it depends on what kind of
