- [00:00] [Music]
- [00:01] telecommunications companies can really
- [00:04] Leverage The Power of generative AI our
- [00:07] amdo Amaze platform in collaboration
- [00:09] with Nvidia really helps us to
- [00:13] supercharge the agent the customer agent
- [00:15] you can take a customer agent that has
- [00:17] one year of experience and really give
- [00:20] them a tool set to make them behave like
- [00:23] an agent that has 5 years of experience
- [00:26] our customers get about 30% give or take
- [00:29] of their calls coming in to their call
- [00:31] centers of people saying hey why is my
- [00:33] bill so high or what what about this
- [00:35] charge on my bill and this synthesis of
- [00:38] information and getting back to the
- [00:39] person and giving the information is
- [00:41] usually a 10 to 15 minute process we've
- [00:44] taken generative AI we've taken all of
- [00:46] that information all of that contextual
- [00:48] data of why you're calling in and we can
- [00:51] provide a response back in about 30
- [00:53] seconds and it's precise it's accurate
- [00:56] our strategic partnership with Nvidia
- [00:59] has been crucial in our acceleration of
- [01:01] generative AI capabilities this allows
- [01:04] us to build on infrastructure and
- [01:06] Frameworks to really solve the needs of
- [01:09] our customers as they evolve and as the
- [01:11] world evolves
