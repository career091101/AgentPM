- [00:00] Hello and welcome back to Equity
- [00:02] Techrunch's flagship podcast about the
- [00:04] business of startups. I'm Kirsten
- [00:06] Corsac, transportation editor at
- [00:08] Techrunch. And today is Friday, December
- [00:10] 26th. I am joined by a larger group of
- [00:13] people today. So that's very exciting.
- [00:15] As always, weekend editor Anthony Haw
- [00:18] with us as well as senior AI reporter
- [00:20] Rebecca Balon and Isabelle Johansson,
- [00:23] who has this very lengthy title, head of
- [00:26] startup Battlefield Program, and also
- [00:28] the host of our newest podcast, Build
- [00:31] Mode. Woo! I like that little woohoo.
- [00:33] Anthony, were you kind of working a
- [00:35] little bit with Isabelle on the podcast?
- [00:38] Did you know it was coming back a couple
- [00:40] months ago? I knew it in the sense that
- [00:42] I just received uh a lot of nudges that
- [00:45] I should be promoting the podcast on
- [00:47] stage at Battlefield, which is the
- [00:50] correct thing to do and and I certainly
- [00:52] did my best. Then I actually, you know,
- [00:53] hearing talking to Isabelle and and
- [00:55] talking to Maggie, one of the other
- [00:56] producers about the podcast, I was just
- [00:58] really excited to hear that it was
- [00:59] coming and what they were up to.
- [01:00] >> Yeah, no pressure, Anthony, but thanks
- [01:02] for the promo. [laughter] Now, I can
- [01:04] also tell you a little bit about Build
- [01:05] Mode, but basically we wanted to launch
- [01:07] a podcast that's sort of the survival
- [01:09] guide for early stage founders because
- [01:12] every year we see about 5,000 people
- [01:14] throw their hat in the ring for Startup
- [01:16] Battlefield, but we only choose 200,
- [01:18] which might sound like a lot, but really
- [01:20] it's pretty competitive. And so this
- [01:22] podcast was born out of the idea that we
- [01:24] wanted to sort of democratize and spread
- [01:26] the knowledge that a lot of founders
- [01:28] here in Silicon Valley have access to,
- [01:30] but to founders around the world,
- [01:31] especially because this year we're
- [01:33] rolling out Startup Battlefield globally
- [01:34] in 2026. So that's what build mode is.
- [01:37] Check it out if you're a builder. But
- [01:38] you know, Kristen, this year actually a
- [01:40] mobility company won Battlefield. How
- [01:42] did you feel about that? I was kind of
- [01:44] surprised that a transportation or
- [01:46] mobility company won just because
- [01:48] everything's so AI focused or I thought
- [01:51] maybe something like in biotech or you
- [01:53] know more deep tech. So it was kind of
- [01:56] cool. I mean I can't remember the last
- [01:57] time. Do you like look in our archives
- [02:00] and see when the last time a
- [02:01] transportation company won? I mean, I
- [02:02] remember many, many years ago, Get
- [02:05] Around being not a winner, but being
- [02:09] Actually, I don't know if they won, but
- [02:10] they were a peer-to-peer car rental
- [02:13] company. I don't think that they won,
- [02:14] though. What was the company called that
- [02:15] won this year? Glide.
- [02:17] >> Glide. Yeah.
- [02:18] >> Yeah. Glide. I'm not surprised because
- [02:19] you we usually we often pick something
- [02:21] that's not just like the hypest, but
- [02:23] something that has real impact. And I
- [02:24] think that in this world of AI this and
- [02:26] AI that, it's all very software, right?
- [02:29] It's all very it's something you can
- [02:30] tangibly hold and people don't
- [02:32] necessarily feel like it's creating this
- [02:35] huge impact on what people, you know,
- [02:38] touch every day of their lives. So, I
- [02:40] mean, that's a really controversial
- [02:41] statement. I might walk that back, but
- [02:42] basically, real world stuff still
- [02:45] matters in the world of AI.
- [02:47] >> Hey, this is the predictions episode, so
- [02:49] you can totally walk things back
- [02:50] because, as our listeners are about to
- [02:53] hear, there were some terrible
- [02:54] predictions last year.
- [03:01] We're closing out 2025 being another,
- [03:04] and I feel like I can say this every
- [03:05] year over the last few years, massive
- [03:07] year in tech. A lot of changes, a lot of
- [03:09] funding rounds, a lot about AI. And
- [03:13] before we get into though, what we think
- [03:15] is going to happen in 2026, I do want to
- [03:19] give a little bit of a nod, a little
- [03:20] critique to what we predicted last year.
- [03:24] And Devin Coldaway is not here. He's our
- [03:27] former coworker now. But h I wish he was
- [03:31] because one of his predictions last year
- [03:33] was that he didn't think the mega
- [03:35] funding rounds would continue at the
- [03:38] same pace in AI. And he thought last
- [03:42] year's giant rounds were quote probably
- [03:45] the last of that scale. And Devon, if
- [03:48] you're listening, boy, were you wrong.
- [03:50] Very briefly, OpenAI raised 40 billion.
- [03:54] Anthropic, I think it was 13 billion,
- [03:56] XAI 20 billion, massive valuations. And
- [04:00] Rebecca, you write a lot about AI, a ton
- [04:02] of seed rounds that were like insane,
- [04:05] >> huge. Like what was it? Thinking Machine
- [04:07] Labs is $2 billion seed round. We will
- [04:10] we will never forget that one.
- [04:11] >> And then Anthony, I don't know if you
- [04:13] want to, you know, roast Devon since
- [04:15] he's not here to defend himself, but I
- [04:16] think he also said we might be headed
- [04:18] towards another bubble.
- [04:20] >> Well, that's not roasting, is it? I yeah
- [04:22] I I was going to say actually even
- [04:23] before that I was going to defend Devon
- [04:25] a little bit because I do think a
- [04:27] prediction is both sort of a factual
- [04:30] statement about the future but it's also
- [04:32] a statement of hope and and maybe if
- [04:34] Devon were here he would say that well
- [04:36] you know in a rational economy we would
- [04:39] not have seen maybe the same number of
- [04:42] insane mega rounds as we did and the
- [04:45] fact that that happened maybe is
- [04:47] indicative of the fact that we are in a
- [04:49] bubble right now which hasn't sort have
- [04:51] been proven true in the sense that there
- [04:53] hasn't been a bubble that's popped but I
- [04:55] think that it has become increasingly
- [04:58] accepted wisdom commonplace wisdom that
- [05:00] I mean we had a whole episode about this
- [05:02] at uh at disrupt actually where I think
- [05:04] the question is more like how bad is it
- [05:07] how irrational is it what will it look
- [05:09] like will it pop will it deflate but
- [05:11] obviously there are at least bubble-l
- [05:13] like tendencies in AI right now
- [05:15] >> Isabelle what's your perspective though
- [05:17] because you see so many very early stage
- [05:19] startups you know some of the
- [05:20] predictions about like a bubble and it's
- [05:23] a dangerous time for a new AI startup.
- [05:25] >> Yeah, I mean these startups still need
- [05:26] cash, right? So I think that's the
- [05:28] challenge right now is we see all these
- [05:30] companies that you know could have
- [05:31] raised a few years ago but now are
- [05:33] really really struggling because if they
- [05:34] don't have skyhigh metrics and traction
- [05:37] from day one they're not even being
- [05:39] considered by VCs, right? So these
- [05:40] companies are needing to look for
- [05:41] alternative sources of capital to be
- [05:43] able to even kind of get off the ground.
- [05:45] So I think what we're seeing these days
- [05:47] is is companies getting first of all
- [05:49] really scrappy and building with almost
- [05:51] nothing in their bank, right? But then
- [05:53] finding ways to to get cash. So of
- [05:55] course seeing more bootstrapped
- [05:57] companies looking into things like
- [05:58] equity crowdfunding. A lot of companies
- [06:00] we see sort of have a mass following on
- [06:03] LinkedIn or or fandom, right? Especially
- [06:05] with the rise of consumer AI, there's
- [06:07] people out there who want to support
- [06:09] these companies and tools that they use
- [06:10] every day. And so now they're able to
- [06:12] sort of um get their hands dirty in in
- [06:14] the early stages of investing which also
- [06:16] then you know gives gives the founders a
- [06:18] leg up. So I think we'll start seeing
- [06:20] some creative funding structures
- [06:22] hopefully more founder friendly
- [06:23] structures as well in 2026.
- [06:25] >> Well that starts to creep into our
- [06:26] predictions. So I thought we would kick
- [06:30] it off with you know a topic that we
- [06:32] never talk about which is AI.
- [06:35] >> I can weigh in on this one. So, there's
- [06:37] a few I mean, God, I could do a whole
- [06:39] episode single-handedly on what my
- [06:41] predictions for 2026 AI will be, but one
- [06:45] thing that I feel is really interesting,
- [06:47] especially given some news that recently
- [06:49] dropped was that Runway, if you guys are
- [06:52] not familiar with Runway, they are a AI
- [06:56] image and video generator, and they just
- [06:58] dropped a world model. And so I
- [07:01] predicted this a little bit earlier this
- [07:03] year when um or earlier in the last
- [07:05] couple of months when World Labs came
- [07:07] out with their really impressive new
- [07:09] model called Marble that we're coming
- [07:12] into an era of world models. And what
- [07:14] are world models? So world models are AI
- [07:17] systems that can create a world an
- [07:20] environment and understand in like a
- [07:22] physics aware kind of way so they can
- [07:24] predict what's going to happen. And so
- [07:26] with Gemini's Genie, World Labs Marble,
- [07:30] Runways, whatever it's called, I forget
- [07:32] right now, but I feel like we're moving
- [07:34] into this space. And I'm hearing a lot
- [07:36] of founders talk about world models in
- [07:38] terms of this is the next stepping stone
- [07:40] to AGI because intelligence doesn't
- [07:43] really just happen from large language
- [07:46] models. You need to understand your
- [07:47] place in the world and how you interact
- [07:49] with it. And when you say we're going to
- [07:51] see more world models, do you expect
- [07:52] that that's something that even, you
- [07:54] know, smaller startups are going to be
- [07:56] able to do or is this something we're
- [07:57] going to be seeing more from, you know,
- [07:58] a handful of the bigger players?
- [08:00] >> It depends on the startup, right? I
- [08:01] mean, we heard that Yan Lun is leaving
- [08:03] Meta. He's doing his own startup.
- [08:05] There's been, you know, rumors that it's
- [08:06] going to be a World Lab startup. So, I
- [08:08] think that some with some great minds
- [08:09] backing it, sure, they might move into a
- [08:13] space where they're doing that. But I
- [08:15] think like small startups without huge
- [08:17] names behind them, definitely not. But
- [08:18] we will see the labs start to compete
- [08:20] and I think we might start to see them
- [08:22] releasing new models in the same way
- [08:24] that we're seeing the large labs
- [08:26] releasing new LLMs in this kind of a
- [08:29] fast-paced cadence.
- [08:30] >> No, I'm sure we'll see some startups
- [08:32] try. I think that's always the fun thing
- [08:34] of of looking through startup
- [08:35] battlefield applications, right? Is
- [08:36] people taking really big swings and
- [08:39] whether they are able to pull it off or
- [08:41] not, I'm sure we'll see plenty that try
- [08:42] to throw their hat in the ring for that.
- [08:44] So, yeah, TBD. Rebecca, I'm wondering I
- [08:46] think 2025 was like the year of the AI
- [08:49] agent. You know, you didn't really you
- [08:51] kind of heard it a little bit in 2024,
- [08:53] but like 2025 everyone that and maybe
- [08:56] like AI for enterprise. And I'm
- [08:59] wondering if you think in 2026 if that's
- [09:02] going to continue or have we hit peak AI
- [09:04] agent?
- [09:05] >> No. No. I think that this is a false
- [09:07] that was like a false prediction from
- [09:08] last year. Like last year was not the
- [09:10] year of the AI agent. It was the year of
- [09:11] like people attempting to do AI agents
- [09:14] and it failing miserably because like
- [09:17] the tech just wasn't ready.
- [09:18] >> Gotcha.
- [09:18] >> I think this year is going to be the
- [09:20] year of the AI agents because we have
- [09:23] this thing called MCP. So Anthropic like
- [09:25] about a year ago came out with model
- [09:27] context protocol and it's basically
- [09:29] everyone's talking about it like it's
- [09:30] USBC for AI, right? So it's the
- [09:33] connector that connects the AI models
- [09:35] and agents, the systems to the data and
- [09:38] tools that are needed. And so this is
- [09:40] just like a plug-and-play. Like before
- [09:42] that developers would have to build
- [09:44] their own connectors, stand them up,
- [09:46] monitor them, but this allows for like
- [09:49] it's like an open- source really easy to
- [09:51] plug in and make those connections. And
- [09:54] then you have like Google recently, they
- [09:56] are now managing their own MCP
- [09:58] connectors for their tools. So it's like
- [10:01] it's all set up and ready to go. And
- [10:03] you're just going to see more of this in
- [10:05] terms of enterprise and in terms of
- [10:08] developers, even just people, random
- [10:10] people who want to I'm currently
- [10:12] experimenting with attempting to use an
- [10:14] open-source agent to connect to certain
- [10:18] tools just to see if I can do it using
- [10:20] MCP and it seems like it's going to be
- [10:22] easier than I thought.
- [10:23] >> I'm very curious to see, you know, what
- [10:25] people are able to build with this. But
- [10:27] I think it has reached the point where
- [10:30] anytime especially like a sort of big
- [10:32] company CEO starts talking about AI
- [10:35] agents, I just immediately get
- [10:37] incredibly skeptical because it feels
- [10:39] like you know where a year before was
- [10:41] just saying AI or Gen AI, now they say
- [10:44] AI agent and it's the same thing of just
- [10:45] sort of like empty hype of get excited
- [10:48] for this. this is the thing that's going
- [10:50] to be so transformative and and you know
- [10:52] it's not me I'm not saying that you know
- [10:54] that they won't be useful in some ways
- [10:56] but that it's become the next thing that
- [10:58] is supposed to kind of live up to this
- [11:02] full promise of AI and I don't know that
- [11:04] anything can live up to that promise at
- [11:06] this point.
- [11:07] >> Yeah. I want to know Rebecca what you're
- [11:09] trying to get this AI agent to do for
- [11:11] you. I mean a couple of different things
- [11:12] like you know for example I want to be
- [11:14] able to connect the data from my Aura
- [11:16] ring to my agent and from my other
- [11:18] fitness trackers because that none of
- [11:20] them all connect together like my Aura
- [11:22] ring doesn't connect to my fitness pal
- [11:24] and it doesn't connect to heavy and
- [11:25] these are apps that I use to track like
- [11:26] my macros and my weightlifting. So, I
- [11:29] want to see if I'm able to create an
- [11:31] agent that I can connect the data from
- [11:34] those two to like personally be able to,
- [11:38] you know, ask it questions and for
- [11:40] advice or what have you and just and
- [11:41] just see what happen. Just
- [11:42] >> if you can hack that, I want to test.
- [11:44] >> I'm going to try this segue. You're
- [11:45] talking about the physical body and one
- [11:46] of my predictions is physical AI in
- [11:49] 2026.
- [11:50] >> Nailed it.
- [11:50] >> Uh, yeah, I came up with that just now.
- [11:53] So, that's my prediction. physical AI
- [11:56] 2026, we're just going to see it even
- [11:58] more.
- [11:58] >> My response is, please say more. What do
- [12:00] you mean by physical AI?
- [12:02] >> Well, okay. So, I mean, first of all, I
- [12:04] feel like it's a little bit of a a term
- [12:07] that has been popularized maybe by
- [12:10] Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Wong, because in a
- [12:14] way, this is kind of the same thing
- [12:15] we've been talking about before, which
- [12:17] is autonomous vehicles is a
- [12:18] representation of physical AI. Rebecca,
- [12:20] you can nod your head or disagree if
- [12:22] you, but that is combining really like
- [12:25] physical things like robotics or cars
- [12:28] and AI together, but what I'm seeing is
- [12:31] it expanding to apply to everything. And
- [12:36] I'm saying this prediction because I've
- [12:38] already been getting pitches for CES and
- [12:41] it is like
- [12:43] by far and the way the one term that I
- [12:47] see. I absolutely think we'll be seeing
- [12:48] more of this on the early stage startup
- [12:50] side as well. I mean even this year for
- [12:52] Battlefield we saw a lot of applications
- [12:54] in physical AI and you know it takes a
- [12:56] lot to get those companies off the
- [12:58] ground from scratch. So I think we tend
- [12:59] to see them come to us at a slightly
- [13:01] later stage. I mean even like glide that
- [13:03] won this year right with autonomous road
- [13:04] to rail transportation. We saw it a lot
- [13:06] with manufacturing robotics. We saw it
- [13:08] in healthcare clean techch even prop
- [13:10] tech we're seeing you know AI for for
- [13:13] monitoring the health and of of
- [13:14] buildings. Um, so I think there's many
- [13:16] ways that we'll see it come into our
- [13:18] daily lives. We saw it in um, you know,
- [13:20] security cameras that are able to detect
- [13:22] threats throughout different locations.
- [13:23] So I'm also really excited about the
- [13:25] rise of physical AI and hope to see more
- [13:27] startups building in that space, but
- [13:29] there are, you know, a lot of big
- [13:30] players who who are, you know, heavy
- [13:33] competitors. So we'll see. We'll see.
- [13:35] Speaking of AI everywhere, Anthony, I'm
- [13:37] going to put you in the hot seat now.
- [13:39] You've been tracking sort of media and
- [13:41] content. What are your predictions for
- [13:43] maybe how AI is going to creep into that
- [13:45] more? What you're seeing is both a lot
- [13:48] of companies like you know Disney
- [13:50] recently announced that they're making
- [13:51] having a partnership with Open AAI and
- [13:53] and so you're going to see a lot of like
- [13:54] on a corporate level a lot of
- [13:56] experimentation a lot of pilots a lot of
- [13:59] deals and then I think you're going to
- [14:00] see a lot of push back from you know the
- [14:04] creative community from you know various
- [14:06] kinds of workers and talent and and so I
- [14:10] think one way that's going to shake out
- [14:11] is uh what we're already starting to see
- [14:13] in terms of basically statements ments
- [14:15] or certifications that something is made
- [14:18] without any gen AI. So, you know, we
- [14:21] talked a couple months ago, I think,
- [14:22] about this Apple TV show Plurabus and
- [14:25] the fact that they have, you know, a
- [14:26] little statement at the end of the
- [14:27] credits that just says this show is made
- [14:29] by humans. And I think you're going to
- [14:31] see more statements like that. And
- [14:32] you're possibly going to see more
- [14:33] standardization around that as well that
- [14:35] maybe like the Writer Guild of America
- [14:37] or Screen Actors Guild might actually
- [14:39] start putting a process in place or, you
- [14:41] know, boilerplate language about what
- [14:43] that might look like. So certified by
- [14:44] humans,
- [14:45] >> certified by hum, made by humans,
- [14:47] certified by humans, it is ultimately a
- [14:50] fairly difficult thing to police. Like
- [14:52] even when we talk about written
- [14:53] language, right? Like there's all this
- [14:55] software that's supposed to detect
- [14:56] whether or not something was generated
- [14:58] by chat GPT or some other large language
- [15:00] model. I think all of them are sort of
- [15:02] notoriously
- [15:03] not fully accurate. And so I I don't
- [15:06] think it's that they're successfully
- [15:08] going to police Gen AI out of all this
- [15:10] like Hollywood content, but that you're
- [15:12] going to see a sort of more organized
- [15:14] push back and a more clear articulation
- [15:17] of the idea that at least some people
- [15:19] don't want this.
- [15:19] >> We actually saw some interesting
- [15:21] Battlefield companies that, you know,
- [15:22] are not generating content that will be
- [15:25] distributed for for the Hollywood scene,
- [15:27] but but more tools for, you know,
- [15:29] storyboarding movies and things like
- [15:31] that. That was really interesting to
- [15:32] help them organize their thoughts. And I
- [15:34] think there are some some useful
- [15:35] applications in this space. Not all of
- [15:37] it kind of has to be the enemy, but of
- [15:38] course I'm curious to see see how they
- [15:41] end up policing that like you said
- [15:42] because it's it's tricky. I struggle to
- [15:44] tell the difference between AI generated
- [15:46] content and not on a daily basis. I I
- [15:48] hope they find a solution for that.
- [15:50] >> I'm wondering if any of you have any
- [15:52] predictions around how AI meets media
- [15:56] might play out on sort of the regulatory
- [15:58] front. for instance, like is FTC going
- [16:02] to do anything about the Netflix deal,
- [16:05] for instance, and will that have any
- [16:09] effect on other deals in media? Rebecca,
- [16:12] you recently wrote about how there are
- [16:14] efforts to prevent states from policing
- [16:17] AI regulations and it becoming more of a
- [16:20] federal framework. So, I'm wondering if
- [16:22] either of those two things on the media
- [16:24] front or on the AI policy front. Well,
- [16:25] the the Netflix thing, I think if that's
- [16:27] what you're referring to, I think the
- [16:28] FTC will do absolutely nothing about
- [16:29] that. And in terms of AI policy, I mean,
- [16:32] glad you asked, Kristen, because Trump
- [16:34] just, you know, recently dropped his
- [16:36] executive order about trying to curb
- [16:38] state AI laws or preempt state AI laws,
- [16:41] you know, on the grounds that AI is
- [16:43] interstate commerce and that's federal,
- [16:45] you know, that's federal ground. And I
- [16:48] think that, you know, I've I just kind
- [16:49] of wrote a story about this that this
- [16:52] will create a bit of regulatory
- [16:53] uncertainty for startups in the short
- [16:56] term at least because
- [16:59] it just means that specifically for
- [17:01] smaller startups like bigger firms, they
- [17:02] can wait it out. They can handle
- [17:04] everything. But as states are, you know,
- [17:08] the the EO directs federal agencies to
- [17:12] essentially sue states that have enacted
- [17:14] AI laws that are a little too ownorous
- [17:16] or or what have you. So whatever that
- [17:17] definition ends up being, who knows? But
- [17:20] all of this is going to be playing out
- [17:21] in the courts, right? And so in the
- [17:22] meantime, startups will be like, uh,
- [17:24] well, I mean, I started doing compliance
- [17:26] for this. Do I stop? Do I wait? Do I
- [17:29] continue? I guess my prediction is that
- [17:31] there will be more confusion in the
- [17:33] short term. I'm hesitant to say that
- [17:36] there will be no federal policy that
- [17:37] gets enacted. Certainly, Congress moves
- [17:41] so slow. Uh, but there's a lot of push
- [17:44] to do it. So, I mean, I don't know. What
- [17:47] do you guys think? Do you think anyone
- [17:48] think there's going to be some federal
- [17:49] AI policy next year?
- [17:51] >> No.
- [17:52] >> Yeah. Short and sweet prediction. No.
- [17:54] >> Moving on.
- [17:55] >> I do I do actually want to go back to
- [17:56] something else that you touched on. You
- [17:58] you mentioned that you don't think the
- [17:59] FDC is going to do anything about the
- [18:00] Netflix Warner Brothers acquisition. Uh,
- [18:03] which I found interesting because uh I
- [18:04] don't agree. I I don't know that they're
- [18:06] going to block it. I have no idea about
- [18:08] whether it's that's going to happen, but
- [18:09] I think Trump has made it clear that he
- [18:12] wants to kind of give Netflix a bit of a
- [18:15] hard time on this. Kind of see if he can
- [18:17] maybe extract other concessions from
- [18:19] them. So, I think I think like Trump is
- [18:21] going to make the executives at Netflix
- [18:23] sweat a little to make this happen. I
- [18:24] don't know if I think the deal probably
- [18:26] will go through, but it's not going to
- [18:28] be clear sailing.
- [18:30] >> Well, speaking of deals, what about VC
- [18:32] deals in 2026? What do you guys think's
- [18:34] going to happen? I think we're going to
- [18:35] unfortunately continue to see this
- [18:37] liquidity crisis that VCs are facing and
- [18:40] I think the LPs are starting to get
- [18:41] frustrated, right? I've seen a lot of
- [18:44] family offices and and institutional LPs
- [18:46] who are just starting to kind of go
- [18:48] directly to invest in startups
- [18:49] themselves, cutting out the middleman
- [18:50] entirely. I don't know what this means
- [18:53] for the future of VC as an industry, but
- [18:55] we're seeing this more and more of like,
- [18:57] you know, hire one person to a family
- [18:59] office who can direct invest in startups
- [19:01] and has that network and that
- [19:02] credibility and, you know, you don't
- [19:03] need to have a VC firm as that
- [19:05] middleman. So, you know, and this can
- [19:07] often be more favorable for the startups
- [19:08] too because they don't have that
- [19:10] timeline to exit, you know, within seven
- [19:11] years or whatever it may be, but they
- [19:13] oftentimes are more aligned with their
- [19:15] industry if the, you know, LPS have a
- [19:18] specific uh network or industry of
- [19:20] focus. I'm seeing a lot more founders
- [19:22] look for that. Although family offices
- [19:23] and LPs are still sort of like, you
- [19:25] know, a unicorn. It's very difficult to
- [19:27] to find and understand that space. But
- [19:29] I'm I'm curious to see how that plays
- [19:31] out and if, you know, if VCs are going
- [19:33] to continue to take these bets on these,
- [19:35] you know, sort of AI enterprise SAS
- [19:38] companies and the safe bets and the, you
- [19:40] know, third-time founders and sort of
- [19:42] the typical profile we're seeing, then
- [19:44] what are the what are the rest of the
- [19:45] founders to do, right? all of these
- [19:47] companies that are able to spring up
- [19:49] with the rise of AI. Anybody can build a
- [19:51] company today, but not everybody has
- [19:52] access to capital. And so I think again
- [19:54] there's going to be more alternative
- [19:56] sources. And I think that LP's direct
- [19:58] investing is is my hot take, my
- [20:00] prediction for 2026.
- [20:02] >> Can you elaborate a little bit as to
- [20:03] what you think is driving that LP direct
- [20:05] investment? Is it because VCs are
- [20:09] continuing to go to like the repeat
- [20:11] founders and you know the structure that
- [20:14] you just sort of played out or is there
- [20:15] another economic reason why this is
- [20:17] happening?
- [20:17] >> More than anything it's the control
- [20:19] right I think instead of having that
- [20:21] that middle man to to do the investing
- [20:23] for them they can be take their own
- [20:25] bets. I think LPs might be getting
- [20:26] frustrated with the lack of liquidity
- [20:28] and are seeing that, you know, with all
- [20:30] these companies popping up and the sort
- [20:32] of average consumer having a better
- [20:34] understanding of of what AI is today
- [20:36] that people have have more of their own
- [20:38] bets. And I think that why have that
- [20:41] middleman when when more and more people
- [20:43] are getting involved in investing
- [20:44] themselves, right? Angel investors,
- [20:46] equity crowdfunding. I think, you know,
- [20:48] people want to take matters into their
- [20:49] own hands. So, we'll see if that holds.
- [20:51] But I I do think that the venture
- [20:53] landscape is is really tough right now
- [20:55] and I hope that it gets better in 2026,
- [20:57] but I haven't heard much to to indicate
- [20:59] that yet. Yeah. I wonder how that's
- [21:01] going to affect startups, right? Like
- [21:03] cuz it feels like it's a new, you know,
- [21:06] for example, I lived in New Zealand for
- [21:07] a little bit and it was a way less
- [21:08] mature startup ecosystem and that often
- [21:10] meant that startups got really bad
- [21:12] deals. Like deals that were so bad that
- [21:15] it actually killed them too early
- [21:17] because they gave away too much equity
- [21:18] too soon. Like I wonder if like
- [21:19] inexperienced startups going through
- [21:21] family offices that are also maybe a
- [21:23] little more inexperienced in terms of
- [21:25] you know investing in startups if that
- [21:27] kind of creates a yeah like if that
- [21:29] backfires at all for them. I'm not sure.
- [21:31] >> Yeah. And I think it's also you know we
- [21:33] see that in Europe quite a bit as well
- [21:34] is also just slower moving deals um
- [21:37] where in you know Silicon Valley and the
- [21:38] VC space it it happens quickly when they
- [21:40] have conviction but I think maybe with
- [21:42] uh working directly with LPs it's going
- [21:44] to take a lot longer for them to get
- [21:46] that conviction. might be more
- [21:47] relationship focused. So, I think yeah,
- [21:50] you're right. For for first-time
- [21:51] founders, they're going to need to have
- [21:53] have all their tools in their belt
- [21:54] before they approach these companies.
- [21:56] Also, it's obviously less support and
- [21:58] resources, less portfolio operation. So,
- [22:00] I'm not necessarily arguing that it's
- [22:02] better for the startups on, you know, a
- [22:04] broad front, but I do think we'll see
- [22:06] more activity from LPS. Is it like a
- [22:08] money drying up thing in Silicon Valley?
- [22:09] Because that's kind of what I think is
- [22:11] is happening with this IPO push that
- [22:13] we're seeing for next year. I think
- [22:14] everyone's expecting it to be like a
- [22:16] blockbuster IPO year with Open AI and
- [22:18] Anthropic. So,
- [22:19] >> every year is a blockbuster year for
- [22:20] IPOs. Don't you know [laughter] that's
- [22:22] every year?
- [22:23] >> I feel like I don't know. 2024 was kind
- [22:26] of low on the
- [22:27] >> No, it's I'm not saying that actually
- [22:29] plays out. I'm saying every year people
- [22:31] predict that the following year is going
- [22:32] to be the big year for IPOs.
- [22:34] >> People always want it to be a
- [22:35] blockbuster year.
- [22:36] >> Yeah, that's the optimism. Let's say to
- [22:38] next year is a big year for IPOs. let's
- [22:41] say open anthropic actually make it to
- [22:44] the public markets. honestly unclear the
- [22:46] reason I mean my like cynical take is
- [22:48] like they they're exhausting private
- [22:50] money and like gulf money and need to
- [22:52] hit the public markets because AI costs
- [22:55] money but I don't know maybe that's just
- [22:57] >> well I would say this a lot of companies
- [22:59] are not profitable when they go public
- [23:00] but what what's been interesting to me
- [23:02] is the trend of pre-revenue companies
- [23:05] yes going public and that we saw happen
- [23:07] a lot with like the whole spa era that's
- [23:10] settled down a little bit I think
- [23:11] because there's been a lot of a drop in
- [23:13] the market with some of those companies
- [23:14] just haven't done as well. But if you're
- [23:16] a deep tech company, to Isabelle's point
- [23:18] before, and you're having a hard time
- [23:19] accessing capital, and you are a deep
- [23:22] tech company, meaning you don't have
- [23:24] like you're not a software as a service
- [23:26] company that has a product that can be
- [23:27] put out, you know, very quickly, you're
- [23:29] looking at a 5 to 10 year development.
- [23:33] Where do you find that capital? And
- [23:35] maybe you turn to the public markets
- [23:36] because of it or family office to your
- [23:38] point as well. But I actually had a
- [23:40] question Isabelle for you about, you
- [23:42] know, you've seen so many of the
- [23:44] Battlefield applications and you get a
- [23:46] lot of inbound. What trends do you see
- [23:49] like happening that happened this year
- [23:52] in terms of the types of industries that
- [23:53] they're going after? And do you have a
- [23:55] prediction of where that's going in
- [23:56] 2026?
- [23:57] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean this year I think we
- [23:59] saw all of the verticalized AI right
- [24:02] across pretty much every industry but a
- [24:04] lot in health tech and biotech of course
- [24:07] which again also have really long R&D
- [24:09] cycles. So another industry that is very
- [24:12] capital intensive so hard at the early
- [24:14] stage but I'm I'm glad to see a lot of
- [24:16] people are building and taking those
- [24:17] risks and those bets because we need it.
- [24:20] Similarly in climate tech, right, food
- [24:22] and ag tech. So these industries that I
- [24:24] think people want to see change and
- [24:26] founders are taking matters into their
- [24:27] own hands in many of these spaces, which
- [24:29] I think is really great to see. In terms
- [24:31] of AI, we've seen a lot of sort of the
- [24:33] compliance layer, right? Cyber security,
- [24:35] these companies that want to be the
- [24:37] backbone of the infrastructure that
- [24:38] other companies build on as we get
- [24:40] deeper and deeper into this AI uh world.
- [24:43] I think that's interesting and cool to
- [24:44] see the startups building that instead
- [24:46] of, you know, maybe waiting for some of
- [24:47] the incumbents. I guess we've also seen
- [24:49] quite a bit of consumer and edtech AI
- [24:53] much more than last year. I think this
- [24:55] is a really tricky space even if you
- [24:57] have the traction. It is still often an
- [25:00] ads an ads play that VCs are are
- [25:03] skeptical of. Um but nonetheless I think
- [25:05] there's ways to you know democratize
- [25:08] access to education. There's also you
- [25:10] know of course a lot of really fun like
- [25:12] Rebecca was saying like these health
- [25:13] tools and health apps. And I think the
- [25:15] last part here is really these sort of
- [25:17] pick and shovel tools if you will. So
- [25:19] all of these other companies that are
- [25:22] supporting right B2B um B2B SAS
- [25:25] companies a lot of DevOps a lot of cloud
- [25:27] infrastructure. It's always interesting
- [25:30] to sort of weed through the applications
- [25:31] in those spaces because um it gets it
- [25:34] gets heavy it gets technical and it's
- [25:36] hard to sort of differentiate sometimes
- [25:39] because we see a lot of them. But I'm
- [25:41] hoping that, you know, it's uh a few of
- [25:43] them will kind of emerge as as clear
- [25:45] winners in the space.
- [25:46] >> Super quick question. Do you base who
- [25:48] you choose for Battlefield at all on
- [25:50] whether or not that company is going to
- [25:52] be acquired in the next like year or
- [25:54] two? I'm just curious because when you
- [25:55] say the picks and shovels, I'm like,
- [25:56] "Oh, so they're just like they're
- [25:58] holding out for an acquisition from
- [25:59] Google or something, right?" Like,
- [26:00] >> so no, we don't pick companies based on
- [26:02] that. I mean, I think that's that's the
- [26:04] interesting part about Battlefield,
- [26:05] right? Is that we we do not invest in
- [26:07] these companies. So there's, you know,
- [26:09] for us, there's no pressure for an
- [26:11] acquisition. We're not necessarily
- [26:12] betting on the companies that, you know,
- [26:14] are going to give us the quickest and
- [26:15] dirtiest exit, but rather um companies
- [26:18] that have obviously potential to be
- [26:20] massive and be successful, but that are
- [26:22] building companies and and technologies
- [26:24] that that we need, right? That have
- [26:26] stories worth telling that when I read
- [26:27] Techrunch and I see that Glide One, I'm
- [26:30] very comforted by the fact that people
- [26:32] are out there building these kind of
- [26:33] technologies, right? So, I think that's
- [26:34] really sort of the the fluffy answer to
- [26:37] how we choose it without going into all
- [26:38] of our secret sauce, but obviously
- [26:40] companies that have legs to stand on,
- [26:41] but that are building meaningful and
- [26:43] impactful tech rather than the quickest
- [26:46] exit. [laughter]
- [26:46] >> So, you've been talking about a lot of
- [26:48] like kind of what you think you're going
- [26:49] to see, what's like you're you're hoping
- [26:51] to see. Uh to make it slightly more
- [26:52] negative, because I think that's more
- [26:53] fun. Um just at the end of the
- [26:55] application process, is there a
- [26:57] buzzword, a phrase that you just think
- [26:59] you're going to be completely sick of?
- [27:00] It's not necessarily going to disqualify
- [27:02] a startup, but you just be like, I never
- [27:04] want to hear these words ever again.
- [27:05] >> Okay, I'm trying to think of the exact
- [27:07] phrase, but I think even this year, if
- [27:09] it was not like another type of sales
- [27:12] team tools, sales enablement tool, or
- [27:14] like a lot of these internal tools that
- [27:16] are just like I don't know, we saw
- [27:18] probably a million times, but of course
- [27:20] it's agent, right? So, it's some type of
- [27:22] internal enterprise agent, right? To
- [27:24] make people's jobs easier, fine. But
- [27:27] like for every single job out there, no.
- [27:30] Please God, no. We don't need an AI
- [27:32] agent specifically for every job on the
- [27:34] planet. Like I think um you know I'm I'm
- [27:37] hoping that we'll see bigger buckets,
- [27:39] right, of like you know maybe an
- [27:40] industry focus rather than targeted for
- [27:43] a specific job. And I'm sure these
- [27:45] startups have plans to expand to to
- [27:46] other teams in the company. But for now,
- [27:49] I'm seeing [clears throat] many many
- [27:51] variations of that same topic. AI will
- [27:53] save the world. They said
- [27:55] >> any day now. Yeah, any day. We're gonna
- [27:57] move to the final rapid fire. I hope
- [28:00] that you all have fun ones prepared. I
- [28:03] know I do. So, I'll kick things off. I
- [28:05] predict that Johnny IV and Sam Alman
- [28:09] will release a behind the music style
- [28:12] documentary of their collaboration and
- [28:15] then we'll have a giant public breakup.
- [28:16] >> Uh, I I endorse that.
- [28:18] >> I love these. Mine are silly, too. My
- [28:20] last one is I believe that Whimo will be
- [28:23] raising even more money, more billions
- [28:26] in order to scale at an even faster
- [28:29] pace. I don't think that they're going
- [28:31] to IPO in 2026, but I do think that
- [28:33] they're going to have another massive
- [28:34] round. Oh, ticking on to that, I feel
- [28:36] that that public acception adoption of
- [28:39] of self-driving cars is really going to
- [28:41] shift to, you know what, yeah, drivers,
- [28:44] human drivers do suck. Like, let's get
- [28:46] the robots on this one. My not silly one
- [28:48] is that I think latestage VC is going to
- [28:50] die or get hurt significantly because so
- [28:54] much hype money is tied up in these AI
- [28:55] companies that have fallen or gotten
- [28:57] eaten by the giants and like that return
- [28:59] on investment is just not going to show
- [29:00] up.
- [29:00] >> I I feel like that's an aspirational
- [29:02] one. I feel like it should happen. I
- [29:04] don't but it feels I don't know if it
- [29:06] will happen.
- [29:06] >> I mean I don't want this to happen but
- [29:07] anyway, other rapid fire Elon Musk will
- [29:10] weigh in on something that he has no
- [29:12] expertise in like cooking or home decor
- [29:15] or something. And I'm saying this based
- [29:16] on the fact that he started weighing it
- [29:18] on fashion this week. I was like, come
- [29:19] on, guy. Like, come on. Like, Cybertruck
- [29:22] is not it. It's not the aesthetic flex
- [29:25] that you think it is.
- [29:26] >> Well, for some people, they love the
- [29:27] Cybert truck, right?
- [29:28] >> Some people, Kirsten, but most people
- [29:30] don't.
- [29:30] >> Some people,
- [29:31] >> speaking of fashion, I think that Jensen
- [29:33] Wang's leather jacket is going to show
- [29:34] up on prediction markets somehow. Like,
- [29:37] if he's wearing it, it means that, you
- [29:39] know, something is going to happen. I do
- [29:41] know really quickly. I know I said I
- [29:43] wasn't going to uh jump in on rapid
- [29:44] fire, but I will say that he once told
- [29:46] me, this is many years ago before he was
- [29:49] uh more difficult to get interviews
- [29:50] with, but I was at Jensen.
- [29:53] >> Okay.
- [29:53] >> It was a small group of reporters, and
- [29:54] he said that his wife gets him a new
- [29:57] >> jacket every year.
- [29:59] >> So,
- [30:01] while they're black, they're always the
- [30:04] same color, there are slight
- [30:05] differences.
- [30:07] >> So, so look for those deep cuts. Maybe,
- [30:10] you know, if he pulls one out of the
- [30:11] archives.
- [30:12] >> Amazing. Um, my last rapid fire was that
- [30:14] we will have a return of the dumb phone
- [30:16] so founders can stay quote founder
- [30:18] focused.
- [30:19] >> Mhm. Oh, nice. I like that one.
- [30:22] >> I would buy that probably. I mean, I
- [30:24] know there are other dumb phones already
- [30:26] like kind of taking off. Actually, I
- [30:28] would I would tie in one of my rapid
- [30:29] fires uh to that, which is that, you
- [30:32] know, I think there's been a lot of
- [30:32] reporting that there's going to be a
- [30:34] foldable iPhone. And I think that I
- [30:36] don't think it's going to be a complete
- [30:37] flop, but I I don't think there's a mass
- [30:39] market for this. I think it's going to
- [30:40] be a niche product. Um, a lot of weirdos
- [30:43] are going to try it out. I'm also going
- [30:44] to predict that Tim Cook is not going to
- [30:47] retire next year. I don't have any
- [30:49] inside information. I just figure it's
- [30:50] sort of a coin toss and why not say he's
- [30:52] not going to retire? And then my last
- [30:54] rapid fire is imagine whatever you think
- [30:57] is the worst tweet of all time. I think
- [30:59] something worse will be posted in 2026.
- [31:02] >> I agree with that, Isabelle. My hot
- [31:04] takes or rapid fire takes. I think I
- [31:06] think stealth mode is dead.
- [31:09] >> I think that, you know, we're going to
- [31:10] have to see some forced stealth modes
- [31:12] when they have, you know, compliance and
- [31:13] FDA and stuff like that to go through.
- [31:15] But in terms of the AI wave, people are
- [31:17] just launching left and right. So
- [31:19] stealth mode is dead in 2026. Along
- [31:22] those lines, I think we're going to see
- [31:23] I mean more like overuse of these
- [31:27] buzzwords like AI native, right?
- [31:28] Everything is going to be AI native
- [31:29] because if it's not, nobody's going to
- [31:31] talk to you, right? And so even if it's
- [31:33] not quite, I think we're going to be
- [31:35] seeing some stretches in that in that
- [31:37] aspect. And I think my last hot take is
- [31:40] that we'll probably see some ridiculous
- [31:42] terms like, you know, like these uh full
- [31:44] stack AI founder, right? And these
- [31:47] things catch on and if you're not that,
- [31:49] you're not getting funded. So full
- [31:51] stack, what does that mean? I'm really
- [31:52] good at a chat, GPT, Claude, and Gemini.
- [31:55] >> Doesn't matter what it means, it's a
- [31:56] buzz word. To add to that, I think
- [31:59] you're kind of getting there, which is
- [32:01] the oneperson company startup that does
- [32:04] everything. I think that will happen in
- [32:06] 2026 if it hasn't happened already.
- [32:08] >> Absolutely.
- [32:09] >> Isabelle, give me a prediction. Probably
- [32:12] a really solid one because you're
- [32:14] planning it on what's coming in 2026
- [32:16] with build mode.
- [32:18] >> Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, this
- [32:19] season for season one, we focused on
- [32:21] everything go to market for founders,
- [32:23] right? All aspects of going to market.
- [32:25] And season two will be focusing on
- [32:28] people from all aspects, team, hiring,
- [32:31] firing, finding co-founders. Um really
- [32:33] diving into how you build that team and
- [32:35] how you keep it strong. So um I think
- [32:37] it'll be a really refreshing topic to
- [32:39] start 2026 with. Hopefully, you know, a
- [32:41] little bit more um you know, positive
- [32:44] than some of the last years of layoffs
- [32:46] that we've seen a lot of. Um and now
- [32:48] we're going to talk about building a
- [32:49] strong team. So looking forward to that.
- [32:50] >> All right. What do you think of our
- [32:52] predictions? Please let us know. You can
- [32:54] find us at EquityPod. Thanks as always
- [32:57] for listening and enjoy your holiday.
