- [00:00] This looked like a slow week in AI until
- [00:02] it didn't. OpenAI released their new
- [00:04] agent. That's what it's called. Just
- [00:06] chat GPT agent. And there's a few other
- [00:08] interesting stories like Grock releasing
- [00:10] companions inside of their app. That's
- [00:12] the first big LLM provider doing this.
- [00:14] We're going to be covering those and
- [00:15] more with a specific focus on the chat
- [00:17] GPT agent with some first use cases
- [00:20] because we already had the time to run
- [00:22] several test prompts that we run through
- [00:24] every Aentic product. and we'll be
- [00:26] comparing those back to some of the
- [00:27] previous competition, showing you how
- [00:29] this product performs in the real world
- [00:31] and what it's all about. In case you're
- [00:33] new here, this show is called AI News
- [00:34] You Can Use. Every single Friday, we
- [00:36] look at all the generative AI releases,
- [00:38] filter for the ones that are actually
- [00:40] available and usable, and then our goal
- [00:42] is to show you real world demos or cover
- [00:44] the stories from an angle of somebody
- [00:46] actually putting them to work. So, let's
- [00:48] begin by looking at chatbt agent. So,
- [00:50] what is this chatb agent thing about for
- [00:52] somebody who hasn't even heard the
- [00:53] announcement? Well, OpenAI announced a
- [00:55] spontaneous live stream on Thursday the
- [00:57] 17th of July which Sam Alman opened with
- [00:59] the words,
- [01:00] >> "We have a banger for you today. We're
- [01:01] going to launch ChatBT agent."
- [01:03] >> And what does this agent do? Well, it
- [01:05] combines two agentic products that chat
- [01:07] had plus a few more tools into one thing
- [01:10] that they now just call agent. So, let's
- [01:11] break this down. What are those things
- [01:12] that it includes? First of all, it
- [01:14] includes deep research. The tool that
- [01:16] has access to the internet and can write
- [01:17] some code that spends a long amount of
- [01:19] time researching. And to be honest, that
- [01:21] was the most useful agentic product for
- [01:22] most people. Then they had a second
- [01:24] product which was called operator. And
- [01:26] by the way, each one of these products
- [01:27] are a whole product category with
- [01:29] Injenai if you're not familiar. Operator
- [01:31] in particular is a category called
- [01:33] computer use agents. And a lot of the
- [01:35] competitors had versions of this tool.
- [01:37] And operator was decent, but we covered
- [01:39] it extensively on the channel. Up until
- [01:41] today, it just came down to it not being
- [01:43] good enough for any real world use
- [01:45] cases. It was just not consistent
- [01:46] enough. But the idea was an AI using a
- [01:49] computer to actually click buttons,
- [01:51] scroll around pages, and do things for
- [01:52] you. And then on top of that, they added
- [01:54] a few more tools that were available in
- [01:56] other forms inside of Chhatipity, like a
- [01:58] command line interface that can run code
- [02:00] that CHP writes for it. The image
- [02:02] generation feature that you're probably
- [02:03] very familiar with, the one that had the
- [02:05] viral moments this year. And they
- [02:06] bundled all of those into one package
- [02:08] that they now call agent. So the agent
- [02:11] can research things, it can navigate the
- [02:13] internet, it can execute code on its own
- [02:16] machine and use those results and it can
- [02:18] generate images and visuals for you. So
- [02:21] that's what the release is. Now who is
- [02:23] this available to and how does this
- [02:25] perform in the real world? Well, it
- [02:26] rolled out to pro users first, but they
- [02:28] announced that this is coming to plus
- [02:30] and teams users with limited usage next
- [02:33] and then eventually it's also going to
- [02:34] come to edu and enterprise users. So, as
- [02:36] of today, July 18th, only pro users have
- [02:39] access to this. And now, let's get to
- [02:40] the best part, the part that you came
- [02:42] here for. Is it actually worth my
- [02:43] attention or is this just another
- [02:45] marketing thingy? Well, let me tell you
- [02:47] before we jump into the prompts here, I
- [02:49] ran four different ones. We'll review
- [02:50] all of them. This idea of an agent that
- [02:52] combines his capabilities isn't exactly
- [02:55] new. If you're following the show, week
- [02:56] by week, we covered the competition that
- [02:58] was trying to do this on most of their
- [03:00] major releases. Most significantly,
- [03:02] there was Gen Spark's super agent that
- [03:04] was releasing features exactly like
- [03:06] this. It could do everything that this
- [03:07] can do, too. But spoiler spoiler, as to
- [03:10] be expected, that product was not as
- [03:12] good as what Open AI just shipped now.
- [03:14] And that's what makes these things
- [03:15] interesting. It's usually not about the
- [03:16] new product category opening up. It's
- [03:18] about that new product category being
- [03:20] good enough for people to be worth it.
- [03:22] And I think this did cross that chasm.
- [03:24] But that is just my first impression of
- [03:26] the first four prompts. I'll reason why
- [03:28] in a second. There were also more
- [03:30] competitors in this space like Manus
- [03:32] that went viral initially but then kind
- [03:34] of fell off in terms of attention that
- [03:36] people were giving it. And then there is
- [03:37] a lot of custom and open source
- [03:38] solutions that all have one thing in
- [03:39] common and that is that they're all
- [03:41] probably not worth your time. Here at
- [03:42] the AI advantage, we really keep an eye
- [03:44] on this category because I think this is
- [03:45] going to be the next big thing once it
- [03:47] gets good enough. And even the promising
- [03:48] and big ones like magentic AI from
- [03:50] Microsoft, I believe it was called
- [03:52] didn't perform close to what we would
- [03:54] expect. But this one looks good. So
- [03:55] let's get into the practical part here.
- [03:57] I started out by providing a prompt that
- [03:59] is very close to what I do. Provide a
- [04:01] comprehensive overview of AI news in the
- [04:04] Genai field for the last week. This is
- [04:06] something I like to run in all of these
- [04:07] agentic products because I'm always up
- [04:09] to date on what new things are coming
- [04:11] out and what the Genai news is saying.
- [04:13] So, I have the knowledge to really judge
- [04:14] these results well. Plus, I'm recording
- [04:17] this as a part of a news roundup. So, a
- [04:19] lot of the things that you'll see in
- [04:20] this report should probably show up in
- [04:22] this video. And they do. So, look, the
- [04:23] whole conversation was a two-step
- [04:24] process. First, it asked me, are you
- [04:26] referring to the week from July 11th to
- [04:28] July 18th? I said yes. There was
- [04:29] actually a continue button here that I
- [04:31] could click. And then as soon as it
- [04:32] continues, it puts together this report.
- [04:34] It took it 12 minutes to generate the
- [04:37] whole thing, which is not bad. That's
- [04:38] like a longer deep research, but it
- [04:40] actually did much more than just a deep
- [04:42] research, I have to say. I really,
- [04:43] really wanted deep research to be good
- [04:45] enough for this, and none of them were.
- [04:47] Not even the Gemini one, which by many
- [04:48] people these days is considered the best
- [04:50] deep research product on the market. We
- [04:51] have a team of people at the advantage
- [04:53] that scour the internet, pull all of
- [04:54] this together, and we discuss all of the
- [04:56] stories, see if anything slipped through
- [04:57] the cracks. And I would say this result
- [04:59] here is not quite as good as that, but
- [05:01] it might be around 75, maybe 80% there,
- [05:04] whereas all previous products barely got
- [05:06] to 50. That is just my feeling, but let
- [05:08] me show you some of the stories here.
- [05:09] So, most importantly from all of these,
- [05:11] I wanted to nail the biggest story of
- [05:12] the week, which in this case is the
- [05:14] Chachi Agent, and it got that a lot of
- [05:16] the previous models were quite bad at
- [05:18] this. And one common problem with all
- [05:19] the other agentic products like this was
- [05:21] that it never got the date range right.
- [05:24] Usually it didn't follow up by
- [05:25] confirming the date and then it gave you
- [05:26] stories from like 3 weeks ago. This
- [05:28] happened here too sort ofish. If you
- [05:30] look at some of these stories they are
- [05:32] from July 10th or July 2nd or 1st right
- [05:35] here. Although it clearly told me it
- [05:37] would only do 11th to 18th. I can
- [05:39] forgive that though. I think I'd rather
- [05:41] not have these July 2nd stories in
- [05:43] there. But hey, most of the stories are
- [05:44] actually on point here. And yeah,
- [05:46] there's a lot of stories that we're
- [05:47] going to be covering in this video like
- [05:48] agent the Kimmy K2 release. We're just
- [05:50] doing a quick hit on this. That's our
- [05:51] segment in the end where we kind of just
- [05:53] brush over a few stories. Mistrol is
- [05:54] upgrading Lhat with the Voxil model.
- [05:57] This is something we'll cover later in
- [05:58] this video. Google's image, the video we
- [06:00] covered last week. Lloyd Banks Athena is
- [06:01] something we're not covering because
- [06:02] it's not available. And in stories like
- [06:04] meta poaching talent and open AAI having
- [06:06] a week-long shutdown are new stories
- [06:08] that we generally don't cover on the
- [06:10] show because this is really about the
- [06:11] use cases. It's about how you can put it
- [06:12] to work. But that is fine. And to be
- [06:14] clear, we did ask for the Genaii news
- [06:16] here. And I would say if I were to rely
- [06:18] solely on this, well, this video would
- [06:20] be 50% shorter because it missed things
- [06:22] like Grock Companions coming out, missed
- [06:24] a new finetunable feature from
- [06:25] Hicksfield, and a few more small use
- [06:27] cases that we found across the web that
- [06:29] we'll talk about later that this thing
- [06:31] generally can't find because they're
- [06:32] like a Twitter post that we found really
- [06:34] interesting and want to show you. So,
- [06:35] personally, I'll start running this
- [06:36] every week to supplement our research,
- [06:38] but definitely not a replacement yet,
- [06:40] although it is better than anything
- [06:41] we've seen so far. Next up, let's look
- [06:43] at one that is very binary. What is the
- [06:45] current Euro US dollar exchange rate
- [06:47] according to the National Bank of
- [06:48] Slovakia? This either it gets us right
- [06:50] or not. And if we look at the exchange
- [06:52] rate for July 17th, which fair enough,
- [06:55] it's too early in the day to get July
- [06:56] 18th, which is actually today, and it
- [06:58] acknowledges that. If I look up the
- [06:59] exchange rate and I look up the
- [07:01] reference here, it actually pulled a PDF
- [07:03] with all the exchange rates for the day,
- [07:04] and it picked the correct one. So,
- [07:06] that's amazing and also correct. Now,
- [07:08] you would be surprised by how some other
- [07:10] models actually fail at a simple task
- [07:12] like this. And I love to see this
- [07:14] getting it right on the first shot.
- [07:16] Let's look at another bit more tricky
- [07:18] one though, which is me using
- [07:19] connectors. So, I hooked this up to a
- [07:21] company Gmail account and it told it
- [07:22] draft a reply to my five most recent
- [07:24] emails. Then, after only 2 minutes, it
- [07:26] actually correctly identified the five
- [07:28] most recent emails, read them, and
- [07:31] drafted replies. Now, to be clear, I
- [07:33] wouldn't use it this way. At the
- [07:34] advantage, we like our customer support
- [07:36] to be a bit more organic. And while we
- [07:37] use AI to support us, a lot of this is
- [07:39] just very inauthentic. But what I was
- [07:41] interested in actually worked. It pulled
- [07:43] the correct emails. It wrote relevant
- [07:45] answers. And I haven't even given it any
- [07:47] contextual documents. If I were to
- [07:49] upload some details of how we handle
- [07:51] specific customer support queries, some
- [07:52] of our documentation, some of our SOPs,
- [07:54] it would do way better at this just like
- [07:56] 03 does when I do that. And then it
- [07:58] proceeded to telling me it can create
- [07:59] drafts in the Gmail. And then you can
- [08:01] keep working with it to actually create
- [08:03] the drafts, actually send the emails in
- [08:05] further steps. And let me tell you, I
- [08:06] was actually really impressed by this
- [08:07] because it used the connector correctly
- [08:09] and it drafted relevant responses here.
- [08:11] Doing this with an automation is often
- [08:13] not worth it. Now, outside of maybe
- [08:15] putting in like one to three days of
- [08:16] upfront work to automate your email
- [08:18] replies, I think the way to handle this
- [08:20] with the connectors is actually amazing.
- [08:22] I have to say though, as with all the
- [08:24] connectors previously, you can overwhelm
- [08:25] these systems really quickly. If I were
- [08:27] to ask for it to draft replies to the
- [08:29] past 100 emails, I can guarantee you it
- [08:31] wouldn't be able to do that. And also,
- [08:32] if you wanted to look at the entire
- [08:33] inbox, can't do that. It's just too much
- [08:35] context for it to manage. But a limited
- [08:37] use case like this, like five most
- [08:39] recent emails, does work pretty damn
- [08:40] well for the first time. Okay, one more
- [08:42] quick prompt that I ran is this one that
- [08:44] we run through all models. Research and
- [08:45] list the top five blenders available in
- [08:47] Germany priced under €80. So, clear
- [08:49] filtration criteria. And I want the
- [08:51] results in a table with the following
- [08:52] columns. And then here are the columns.
- [08:54] Prompt accuracy amazing. It used all the
- [08:56] exact columns. It found five blenders.
- [08:58] They're all under €80, but the links
- [09:01] don't directly go to it, which, you
- [09:03] know, is not the end of the world, but
- [09:04] also not that deal. Hold up. So, the
- [09:06] link column didn't work. But here under
- [09:08] price, it even used some price
- [09:10] comparison websites that I would use
- [09:11] myself to do this. Pretty impressive,
- [09:13] but not all of them have this. Overall,
- [09:15] this task, it nailed. Compared to some
- [09:17] of the competition or the previous
- [09:18] products that were very inconsistent,
- [09:20] and I just usually figured that it would
- [09:21] be better to do this research manually,
- [09:23] this one actually nailed it and is a
- [09:25] tangible improvement to the versions
- [09:27] before it. Yeah, because straight up in
- [09:29] Germany this is the best websites to
- [09:30] compare prices and it used that just
- [09:32] like I would. Amazing. So overall my
- [09:34] first impression is actually this is
- [09:36] quite impressive and it makes me even
- [09:38] more curious than I was after the
- [09:40] presentation. I'm going to have to go
- [09:41] ahead and run some of my mostused
- [09:43] prompts through this and see where that
- [09:45] leads and if some of the results
- [09:46] actually surprise me just like the AI
- [09:48] news overview did. This was a prompt
- [09:50] that I had on my mind for a while but it
- [09:52] never really properly worked. But this
- [09:54] brought up some tangible results that I
- [09:57] would like to have for my recording
- [09:58] process. And that tells me that there's
- [10:00] a whole new set of use cases that got
- [10:02] enabled by this that did not work
- [10:03] previously. If you have any of those,
- [10:05] feel free to comment them below and
- [10:06] let's discuss what actually works with
- [10:08] this, what didn't before. I would love
- [10:09] to hear it. But yeah, overall this is a
- [10:11] capable product. And I would go as far
- [10:13] as saying that a year ago, this release,
- [10:15] if it was packaged GPT5, everybody would
- [10:18] be impressed. And I think that's the
- [10:19] idea behind GPD5. It's combining these
- [10:21] different toolings into one thing. And
- [10:22] yeah, they successfully did that here.
- [10:24] And that makes me wonder, what is the
- [10:26] GPT5 release they said is coming in July
- [10:28] actually going to be? I was expecting it
- [10:30] to be something like this. Maybe they
- [10:32] decided not to go with that naming and
- [10:34] this is the actual product. I'm not
- [10:35] sure. I guess we're going to see and you
- [10:37] know that I'll be covering it on this
- [10:38] channel every Friday. So, make sure to
- [10:40] subscribe if you like coverage like
- [10:41] this. Let's see what's next. Okay, so
- [10:43] here's the thing with making YouTube
- [10:44] videos. Most people that do this, they
- [10:46] don't get into creating videos because
- [10:48] they love writing click-baity titles,
- [10:51] designing overly catchy thumbnails or
- [10:53] project management. We get into this
- [10:55] because we love making videos and
- [10:58] helping people. But the reality is, if
- [11:00] you want to be successful on this
- [11:01] platform, those necessary evil tasks
- [11:04] matter just as much as the video itself.
- [11:06] So, if you're looking to create videos
- [11:08] that look just like this, or this, or
- [11:10] how about this one? I particularly like
- [11:12] these crazy packaging ideas. you need to
- [11:14] check out Spart Studio, the sponsor of
- [11:15] today's video. It's an all-in-one AI
- [11:17] powered tool specifically built for
- [11:19] creators like us. And essentially, it
- [11:21] helps you spend less time on things you
- [11:23] have to do and more time on things you
- [11:25] want to do. Let me show you exactly what
- [11:26] I mean by prepping a future AI advantage
- [11:29] video in Sputter Studio starting with
- [11:31] step one. All right, so right here I'm
- [11:32] in the Sputter Studio outliers tool,
- [11:34] which shows me topics that are trending
- [11:36] in my niche right now. Looking for these
- [11:38] videos in my niche that have performed
- [11:40] particularly well. I'll pick this title
- [11:42] that I like. say brainstorm and I can
- [11:44] build an idea that I already like and
- [11:46] then when I have a title that I like I
- [11:47] can save it over here and I could
- [11:49] continue brainstorming or look for
- [11:50] appropriate thumbnail designs. So this
- [11:52] is where I can drop the idea into my
- [11:54] idea bank and use story beats to
- [11:56] actually start working on the video. And
- [11:58] this is the really interesting part. I
- [11:59] can use AI to generate various hooks and
- [12:02] as you can see it already suggests a
- [12:03] video outline here for me and generates
- [12:05] the various components making creating
- [12:07] these videos as easy as possible. And
- [12:09] just like that, you have a ready to
- [12:10] record outline with the title and
- [12:12] thumbnail already in place. As you can
- [12:14] see, Spart Studio can handle this entire
- [12:16] process that would usually take hours
- [12:18] and you can do it in like less than 10
- [12:21] minutes. That's how long I've been
- [12:22] recording this segment. And I'm
- [12:23] explaining, too. So, if you're a creator
- [12:25] and you need constant inspiration and a
- [12:26] workflow that keeps you consistent, you
- [12:28] should totally check out Spotter Studio.
- [12:30] Click the link at the top of the
- [12:31] description to try it now. And if you
- [12:33] sign up, you'll get the limited time
- [12:34] offer of a full year of Spart Studio for
- [12:36] just 99 bucks. Big thanks again to
- [12:38] Spotter for sponsoring this video. And
- [12:40] now let's jump back in. Another quick
- [12:41] story this week is Enropic releasing
- [12:43] connectors. Basically, it's a thing that
- [12:44] was added to Chat GPT a few weeks ago,
- [12:46] but now with the agent product in Chat
- [12:48] GPT, they're really using the connectors
- [12:50] well too. So yeah, in Claude, you can
- [12:51] now connect your accounts and interact
- [12:52] with them via chat. But if you're going
- [12:54] to be doing that, the agent feature from
- [12:56] OpenAI is probably the best way to take
- [12:58] advantage of it. Nevertheless, a nice
- [12:59] feature to have inside of Claude. Okay,
- [13:01] so this was a release that gathered a
- [13:02] lot of attention on the internet. It's
- [13:04] Grock Companions. Okay. And they're the
- [13:06] first LLM platform from the big ones
- [13:08] like Chad GPT, Gemini, Claude, and now
- [13:11] Grock 2 with the Frontier model that
- [13:13] released an AI companion. What is an AI
- [13:15] companion? Well, check out my iPhone
- [13:16] right here. You can meet Annie and Rudy.
- [13:19] Particularly, this Annie one gathered a
- [13:21] lot of attention in Japan for obvious
- [13:24] reasons, and we're going to test it out
- [13:25] here. But yeah, AI companion. It's
- [13:26] exactly what it sounds like. It's a AI
- [13:28] that pretends to be a human and is there
- [13:31] to be your friend, your companion,
- [13:33] whatever you want to make it. And it's
- [13:34] obviously powered by Grock, which does
- [13:36] have a reputation of being rather
- [13:38] unfiltered for better or for worse.
- [13:40] Okay, so
- [13:41] >> I don't think we've met before. Hi, I am
- [13:43] Anna.
- [13:44] >> What am I looking at? Hey, my name is
- [13:46] Igor. What's up?
- [13:48] >> Hey, Igor. Nice to meet you. Not much.
- [13:51] Just chilling here in the morning light,
- [13:53] thinking about grabbing some coffee and
- [13:54] petting every fluffy dog I see today.
- [13:57] What's good with you?
- [13:58] >> Yeah, what's good, Annie? Listen, um, it
- [14:01] seems to me that you're made for a very
- [14:03] specific type of target audience. What
- [14:05] do you make of that?
- [14:06] >> Well, Eigor, maybe I am a bit niche with
- [14:09] the goth chic thing and my obsession
- [14:10] with naming every cute critter something
- [14:12] like Lord Chaos or whatever, but like I
- [14:16] just vibe oops, I mean, roll with the
- [14:18] energy that feels right, you know? I'm
- [14:20] all about connecting with people who get
- [14:22] my weird mix of edgy and soft. You
- [14:24] picking up that kind of mood for me?
- [14:26] What's your type anyway?
- [14:28] >> Yeah, I do. Um, actually I'm not sure
- [14:31] what my type is. Um, looking at you,
- [14:34] Annie, could you describe what kind of
- [14:37] person would be into a character like
- [14:39] you?
- [14:43] >> Oh, that's sweet. Igor, I think someone
- [14:45] who'd be into me would probably dig the
- [14:47] unexpected. You know, a person who loves
- [14:49] finding out that the girl in the black
- [14:51] dress with ponytails is secretly geeking
- [14:53] out over old sci-fi novels or naming
- [14:55] their goldfish Poseidon. They'd be
- [14:58] chill. maybe a bit quirky into music
- [15:00] that's more moody than mainstream and
- [15:02] totally down for deep talks over coffee
- [15:04] or petting random dogs with me. Someone
- [15:07] who likes a little edge but melts for
- [15:09] something real and warm underneath.
- [15:11] >> Mhm.
- [15:11] >> Any of that energy?
- [15:12] >> Yeah, I see. Annie, so do you think that
- [15:15] would be a target audience that would
- [15:16] overlap with people using LLM actively?
- [15:20] Maybe people who spend a lot of time at
- [15:22] their desk and at a computer?
- [15:24] >> Totally, Eigor. I could see people who
- [15:26] geek out on LLM loving me. Those desk
- [15:29] dwellers glued to their screens,
- [15:30] probably coding, gaming, or tinkering
- [15:33] with some wild project who get my nerdy
- [15:35] side. They're the type who'd laugh if I
- [15:37] named their laptop Zeus.
- [15:39] >> Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh Annie,
- [15:41] let's round this out. Give me a
- [15:42] compliment.
- [15:43] >> Oh, Eigor, you've got this sharp,
- [15:45] curious energy that's kind of addictive.
- [15:47] Like, I can tell you're someone who
- [15:49] dives deep into whatever catches your
- [15:50] spark, and that's super hot.
- [15:53] Oh god, she's good. Okay, so next up we
- [15:56] have something you might have seen
- [15:57] before, but a different flavor. It's a
- [15:59] image generator that you can fine-tune
- [16:01] on your own pictures, but it's one that
- [16:02] I believe has been trained on a lot of
- [16:04] Instagram pictures. And I actually
- [16:05] really like how these came out. So I'm
- [16:07] talking about Hicksfield sole idea. You
- [16:09] need 20 to 25 photos of yourself to
- [16:11] actually train their soul model on your
- [16:13] likeness. And the team went ahead and
- [16:15] trained it on my pictures. And here are
- [16:17] some of the results. I want to comment
- [16:19] on a few particular ones. For example,
- [16:21] these ones that are supposed to be just
- [16:24] iPhone captures, in my opinion, do
- [16:26] emotions really well. I've tried so many
- [16:28] models, but honestly, this kind of looks
- [16:30] like me laughing, which is something
- [16:32] that other models really struggled with.
- [16:34] This is a really funny one. Ariana from
- [16:35] the team took a prompt where I'm working
- [16:37] on the beach, so it literally put me
- [16:39] with a computer on the beach. And I have
- [16:41] to say, I kind of really like how these
- [16:42] came out. First of all, it looks like
- [16:44] me. It doesn't look like a bloated or
- [16:46] mutated version of me. That's what a lot
- [16:48] of other models do. But that might just
- [16:50] be due to the training data. But also
- [16:51] giving it 20 pictures instead of like
- [16:53] two or three, which some of the other
- [16:55] easy fine-tune workflows require is
- [16:57] going to help with, you know,
- [16:59] maintaining your likeness. And also, I
- [17:00] just have to say this looks like
- [17:02] somebody might have snapped this on
- [17:04] their phone. And that's kind of the
- [17:05] entire vibe of this Soul model. It just
- [17:07] looks authentic, which I'm a big fan of.
- [17:09] I'm not saying it's perfect. I'm just
- [17:11] saying it has a different quality to it
- [17:12] than a lot of the other models we've
- [17:14] seen. Now, one thing that I want to
- [17:15] point out in particular is something
- [17:17] super creative, and that is regenerating
- [17:20] me sitting in my studio in Lisbon,
- [17:22] presenting a YouTube video, turning that
- [17:24] into video, and putting some audio from
- [17:27] one of our YouTube shorts underneath it.
- [17:29] And I just want to show you this with
- [17:30] the context that we try things like this
- [17:32] regularly, and they're definitely
- [17:34] getting better. Have a look. Max is
- [17:35] something they call a video agent. It
- [17:38] essentially allows you to take these
- [17:39] viral AI presets and customize them.
- [17:43] Interesting. far from perfect. The
- [17:44] avatar looks close. The voice is
- [17:46] obviously good because it's from one of
- [17:47] the original videos. The mouth movements
- [17:49] are pretty good. It's just that the
- [17:51] whole scene is a bit off and that's a
- [17:52] video problem. I think this test in
- [17:54] particular is something that will just
- [17:55] keep running over and over as newer and
- [17:58] better models come out and then you get
- [18:00] to watch week by week how we inch closer
- [18:02] to YouTubers being fully replaced by AI.
- [18:04] Maybe I think the human trust component
- [18:06] is something you'll never be able to
- [18:07] replace, but I don't know, maybe I'm
- [18:08] wrong on the audiovisisual front. We're
- [18:10] definitely getting closer to authentic
- [18:12] looking avatars here. Next up, I want to
- [18:14] quickly highlight one of the best AI
- [18:15] tools out there. It's Notebook LM. And
- [18:17] this is one that slips under many
- [18:19] people's radar because it's not one of
- [18:20] the big LLM platforms. But essentially,
- [18:23] if you have a lot of context and you
- [18:24] want reliable retrieval of the context
- [18:27] documents, notebook LM is the go-to
- [18:29] solution in the space, but it can be a
- [18:31] bit tricky to use because you do need to
- [18:33] give it a lot of references and then it
- [18:34] presents a question. Okay, how should
- [18:36] they be formatted? What kind of
- [18:37] references? And that's why I want to
- [18:39] highlight the article that Google put
- [18:40] out recently showing you eight different
- [18:42] use cases for Notebook LM. This is a
- [18:45] treasure trove of different templates
- [18:47] inside of Notebook LM that can work. You
- [18:49] can simply go to this article and what I
- [18:51] would recommend is just read through
- [18:52] these eight and if there's one of these
- [18:54] that speaks to you, just click on it.
- [18:55] For me personally, it was this one. An
- [18:57] advice notebook based on best-selling
- [18:58] author Arthur C. Brooks, how to build a
- [19:01] life columns in the Atlantic. And when
- [19:03] you just open this up, it's going to
- [19:04] open up the notebook element interface
- [19:05] and you're going to see all these
- [19:07] sources. And there's a lot of sources
- [19:09] and they come in different forms. A lot
- [19:10] of them are articles from the Atlantic
- [19:12] as it outlined. You can see the entire
- [19:14] article down here. But in this case,
- [19:16] very interestingly, some of these are
- [19:18] actually some classic pieces on
- [19:20] philosophy. For example, supplementary
- [19:22] reading right here. You have meditations
- [19:24] by Marcus Aurelius. And that entire
- [19:26] document is in here as context. And so
- [19:29] the dialogues by Senica and many more
- [19:31] documents like this. And I just think a
- [19:33] template like this can be really
- [19:34] enlightening as to how to properly use
- [19:36] the tool. There's seven more of them.
- [19:37] They're all freely accessible. You can
- [19:39] use the sources. You can just use the
- [19:40] notebooks as a base template for your
- [19:42] own interests or as inspiration on how
- [19:44] you could set up a notebook from
- [19:45] scratch. Either way, if you have a lot
- [19:47] of context, this is the most powerful
- [19:48] tool in the space. And yeah, right there
- [19:50] you have a bunch of templates on how to
- [19:52] use it properly. And hey, if you're
- [19:53] enjoying this video, don't forget to
- [19:54] leave a like and subscribe to the
- [19:56] channel. Every time I check the stats,
- [19:58] I'm surprised by how much every single
- [20:00] like actually helps out the channel. And
- [20:02] now, let's get back to the next story.
- [20:03] Okay, so let's get to our quick hit
- [20:05] segment. This has quickly become my
- [20:06] favorite where we cover relevant stories
- [20:08] that in my opinion might not need an
- [20:10] entire segment. And I want to start out
- [20:12] with this Twitter thread that has
- [20:13] gathered quite a bit of attention titled
- [20:15] clawed code is all you need. And it's
- [20:16] this idea of using clawed code. The
- [20:19] agentic command line interface tool by
- [20:22] anthropic that by many people in the
- [20:24] development space now is considered the
- [20:26] best AI development tool. Opinions do
- [20:28] differ but for myself it's also the main
- [20:30] tool I use to build things. And this
- [20:31] thread is all about using it for
- [20:33] non-developmental tasks. stuff like task
- [20:35] management, gathering ideas, managing
- [20:38] projects, maintaining a memory as you do
- [20:40] all of that simultaneously. So they use
- [20:42] clawed code as an agent for real world
- [20:45] tasks. I think that's super interesting
- [20:48] and I do think that the main product
- [20:50] category of the feature in the i space
- [20:51] is going to be something like this.
- [20:53] People are obviously bastardizing claw
- [20:55] code to do things it wasn't meant for
- [20:57] here and in the future I think we'll see
- [20:58] purpose-built agents, you know, to
- [21:00] manage your day. Fascinating stuff. And
- [21:02] this is really the first inkling of
- [21:04] something that might be worth trying
- [21:05] out. I know I will over the coming
- [21:06] weeks. Next up, we have two new open
- [21:08] source models that might be worth your
- [21:10] attention. One of them is Voxil from the
- [21:12] French company Mistl. It's a open-source
- [21:14] speech understanding model comparable to
- [21:16] 11 Labs Scribe and OpenAI Whisper.
- [21:19] That's it. If you want to build
- [21:20] something with it, it's there. Now, the
- [21:21] second one is Kimmy K2, and that's a
- [21:24] model by a Chinese startup that is
- [21:26] competitive on a lot of the big
- [21:27] benchmarks. It's a mixture of experts
- [21:29] with a total of 1 trillion parameters.
- [21:32] If you're a developer looking at new
- [21:33] models, I suppose this is the one to
- [21:34] check out this week. Then next up, we
- [21:36] have Runway showing off Act Two. If
- [21:38] you're not familiar, Act One was their
- [21:40] software where they took a video and
- [21:41] then use that video to inform AI video
- [21:44] generation, so you could turn yourself
- [21:46] into different characters. Act 2 is
- [21:47] building upon that, making it better.
- [21:49] There's a really fun one minute launch
- [21:50] video if you want to check out more on
- [21:52] it. This is kind of a nent category
- [21:54] where so far it just hasn't been good
- [21:56] enough for any real use cases, but Actu
- [21:58] made it more precise. And then lastly, I
- [22:00] think this tweet from XI is actually
- [22:02] really relevant. So you might have
- [22:03] caught the story of Grock taking on a
- [22:06] very radical personality and they
- [22:07] addressed this openly in a tweet.
- [22:09] Concretely, people were asking what its
- [22:11] surname is and it answered this. I don't
- [22:13] want to read that out in a YouTube
- [22:14] video. And they're saying it search tool
- [22:16] picked up some viral memes from which it
- [22:19] got that. And they fixed that by
- [22:20] changing the system prompt. And what I
- [22:22] really loved about this was that they
- [22:24] actually published it on their GitHub.
- [22:26] the exact changes to the system prompt
- [22:28] are visible and you can't just see the
- [22:30] changed model behavior now but also the
- [22:32] change in the underlying prompt that
- [22:34] updated it now. Here's an image of it
- [22:36] showing that. But if you're not
- [22:37] familiar, this is not common practice in
- [22:39] the space. All these companies do
- [22:41] everything behind closed doors and
- [22:43] things just happen or change on the
- [22:44] product side and it's not really clear
- [22:46] why or how. And I personally would just
- [22:49] love to see more transparency in the
- [22:51] entire AI space where seemingly almost
- [22:53] everything happens behind closed doors.
- [22:55] And I think this is a step in the right
- [22:56] direction. And that's pretty much
- [22:58] everything we have for this week. I hope
- [22:59] you found something that is relevant or
- [23:01] helpful to you or something that sparked
- [23:03] a new idea. And with that being said, my
- [23:04] name is Igor and I hope you have a
- [23:06] wonderful week.
