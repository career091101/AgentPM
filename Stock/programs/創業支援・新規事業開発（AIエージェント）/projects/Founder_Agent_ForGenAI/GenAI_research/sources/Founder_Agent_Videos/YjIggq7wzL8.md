## Text

- [00:00] [ Music ]
- [00:07] MOLLY WOOD: This is WorkLab,
- [00:08] the podcast from Microsoft.
- [00:09] I'm your host, Molly Wood.
- [00:11] On WorkLab, we hear from
experts about the future of work
- [00:14] from how leaders can manage
technological transformation
- [00:17] to what it will take to thrive
- [00:18] in a business world being
reshaped by AI in general
- [00:22] and AI agents in particular.
- [00:26] JARED SPATARO: So in many ways,
- [00:26] I think we're making
every employee a manager,
- [00:30] every employee a leader.
- [00:32] And that's a very
different change.
- [00:35] Today, a lot of knowledge work
happens at the leaf nodes,
- [00:38] people who have to kind of get
the work done all on their own,
- [00:41] whether they're an analyst
or a writer or a designer.
- [00:45] And what we're,
essentially saying is, all
- [00:47] of those jobs are going to turn
into managerial jobs where,
- [00:50] certainly, you can do
the work if you want to,
- [00:51] but you will find you get more
done, you produce better work
- [00:55] when you orchestrate agents
to go get that work done.
- [00:59] MOLLY WOOD: That
was Jared Spataro,
- [01:01] Microsoft's Chief Marketing
Officer for AI at Work.
- [01:04] Spataro and his team help
companies understand how
- [01:07] to use AI to solve unique
business problems,
- [01:09] reduce costs, and drive value.
- [01:12] They also use sophisticated
research and customer feedback
- [01:15] to improve the
company's products
- [01:17] and help customers deploy
them in a relevant,
- [01:19] productive, and secure way.
- [01:21] Some of that research
is on display
- [01:23] in the new 2025 Work
Trend Index report.
- [01:27] It examines survey data
from 31,000 workers
- [01:30] across 31 countries, plus
brings in LinkedIn hiring
- [01:34] and labor market
trends and trillions
- [01:36] of Microsoft 365
productivity signals.
- [01:39] It surfaced insights
to help every leader
- [01:42] and employee understand how
knowledge work will evolve.
- [01:45] And in his AI at Work
newsletter on LinkedIn,
- [01:49] Spataro predicts that soon
all businesses will operate
- [01:52] with collaborative teams
of humans and AI agents,
- [01:56] or what he calls
"digital employees."
- [01:58] He notes that this evolution
will require every leader
- [02:01] to redefine how they
think about their teams.
- [02:04] So we talked about that, as well
- [02:05] as how AI agents will transform
workflows and team structures,
- [02:10] and why the vital first step
for companies is to hire
- [02:14] that first digital employee.
- [02:16] Here's my conversation
with Jared.
- [02:21] [ Music ]
- [02:25] Jared, thanks so much for
joining me on WorkLab.
- [02:27] JARED SPATARO: Oh,
it's great to be here.
- [02:28] Thanks for having me, Molly.
- [02:29] MOLLY WOOD: So a key
phrase that comes
- [02:31] up in the new Work
Trend Index report is
- [02:33] that leaders can now access
"intelligence on tap."
- [02:38] How do you define
intelligence on tap?
- [02:41] JARED SPATARO: Well, I
think it's worth pausing
- [02:43] for a second just to recognize
that, up to this point
- [02:46] in human history, if
you wanted intelligence
- [02:48] to help you do something, you
really had to hire a human.
- [02:52] And today, we have reached the
point with this technology,
- [02:56] with the models that are
out there powered by AI,
- [02:59] that they can really
think, reason,
- [03:01] even do at the level of a human.
- [03:04] So what that means is you can
start to buy intelligence
- [03:07] without hiring humans,
and you can buy it
- [03:10] like you would purchase a
commodity like electricity,
- [03:13] any other input to a business.
- [03:14] That means it goes from
being something scarce
- [03:17] and expensive, also
kind of bundled
- [03:19] up in a particular package, to
something abundant and cheap
- [03:23] and available on demand
in a much smaller package
- [03:27] that you can purchase.
- [03:28] So from my perspective, it's
a really, really big thing.
- [03:31] It's a big deal for business.
- [03:33] MOLLY WOOD: Another key
point in this report is
- [03:35] that AI-forward companies,
or the ones you call
- [03:37] "Frontier Firms," will
have a real advantage
- [03:40] in seizing the force-multiplying
power of AI agents.
- [03:44] Do you think all companies will
have to become Frontier Firms?
- [03:47] JARED SPATARO: I think they'll
either become a Frontier
- [03:49] Firm or they'll end
up being disrupted
- [03:51] by someone who's figured out
how to use this intelligence
- [03:54] on tap more effectively
than they do.
- [03:57] So you look at, for
instance, the volatility
- [04:00] in the market today. You look
at how quickly companies have
- [04:03] to now adapt to all sorts of
different situations and those
- [04:07] that are able to combine
human intelligence
- [04:10] with artificial intelligence
in the form of agents,
- [04:13] I think they're going
- [04:14] to differentiate
themselves for sure.
- [04:17] MOLLY WOOD: The
question of course,
- [04:17] in a time of uncertainty, or,
I guess, really any time, is
- [04:21] what timeline are
we talking about?
- [04:23] How soon do companies have
to be ready for this?
- [04:26] JARED SPATARO: Well,
let's just look
- [04:28] at the report for a second.
- [04:29] Already, 82% of the people
- [04:31] that we surveyed say
they're confident
- [04:33] that they'll use what
they call "digital labor"
- [04:36] to expand their
workforce capacity
- [04:37] in the next 12 to
18 months, Molly.
- [04:40] So that's kind of how companies
are thinking about it.
- [04:43] But at the same time,
we look at this and say
- [04:45] that it will be a
process. There's going
- [04:47] to be a work-in period,
but I'm confident
- [04:50] that this calendar year,
companies who are on it,
- [04:54] who recognize, I've got to
be looking to the future,
- [04:56] they'll be experimenting
with digital labor
- [04:58] and digital employees.
- [04:59] MOLLY WOOD: Well, and of
course, you must be interacting
- [05:02] with customers who are
already operating this way.
- [05:05] Are there examples of companies
who have taken the leap?
- [05:08] JARED SPATARO: For sure.
- [05:09] Interestingly, what we
find is that there's kind
- [05:12] of this barbell in
the distribution.
- [05:15] There are companies who are
going concerns who look at this
- [05:19] and say, Hey, I want to
be on the forefront here.
- [05:23] So, as an example, Dow, they're
an American multinational,
- [05:27] they are already projecting
that they'll save millions
- [05:30] in the first year with
a supply chain agent
- [05:32] that they have created to
catch misapplied fees.
- [05:36] It happens to literally save
them millions of dollars.
- [05:39] But on the other end of the
distribution, the other end
- [05:41] of the spectrum,
- [05:41] we are definitely
seeing AI-native firms
- [05:45] that are really representative
of these Frontier Firms
- [05:49] that are leading the way.
- [05:50] There's an ad agency
called Supergood
- [05:52] that has folded decades of ad
research into their platform
- [05:55] to scale expertise
across teams with AI.
- [05:58] There's another really
interesting company.
- [06:00] It's an AI-powered staffing
firm run by a single employee
- [06:04] that's on track to earn
$2 million this year.
- [06:06] So you look at both ends of the
spectrum and you can see it.
- [06:09] The tough place to be, the place
I don't think anybody wants
- [06:12] to be, is in the middle where
you're not either someone kind
- [06:15] of coming up and disrupting or
someone who's decided, Hey,
- [06:18] I'm going to get ahead of this
because the middle is the place
- [06:20] that will be disrupted.
- [06:21] MOLLY WOOD: Right.
- [06:22] So for the business leaders who
are trying to leave the middle
- [06:25] as soon as possible, who
are trying to recalibrate
- [06:27] for this era, what
should they focus on?
- [06:30] JARED SPATARO: One of the
things that we are seeing
- [06:32] in the report is
that the companies
- [06:34] who are taking the step forward
are those who recognize
- [06:37] that they have to first
increase AI literacy
- [06:40] across the entirety of the firm.
- [06:42] Last year was a really
interesting year
- [06:44] because the WTI,
when we released it,
- [06:47] showed that employees were
leading, they were the people
- [06:50] out in front bringing
AI into the workplace.
- [06:51] Well, this year, it's kind
of really flipped around.
- [06:54] We now have managers who
are leading the charge
- [06:57] and they're recognizing
they're ahead
- [06:59] of many of their employees.
- [07:00] And so we have to
have a way, I think,
- [07:02] to help all employees start
to improve their AI literacy.
- [07:05] But then from there, once
you improve AI literacy,
- [07:08] you kind of have to
change a mindset.
- [07:09] You really have to think,
well, what would I do
- [07:11] if I had intelligence on tap?
- [07:13] Where would I apply that first?
- [07:16] How would I structure everything
from my teams to my processes
- [07:19] to take advantage of that?
- [07:21] And that's maybe the two-stepper
- [07:22] that we'd give, we'd
encourage everybody to start
- [07:25] with a broad base
and then second,
- [07:26] look for very specific
ways to apply the tech.
- [07:30] MOLLY WOOD: We've been
talking about the potential
- [07:32] of AI agents, or
digital employees.
- [07:36] I mean, what is that and how
does that differ from AI,
- [07:39] which we might think of
as a personal assistant
- [07:41] that can manage your
calendar or write an email?
- [07:44] JARED SPATARO: This idea
- [07:44] of a digital employee
introduces a lot
- [07:46] of really important concepts,
- [07:48] but perhaps the most important
concept is this idea
- [07:51] of the digital employee is
autonomous and can go off
- [07:55] and kind of goal seek
in a very complex,
- [07:59] not well-defined environment
to get to an outcome
- [08:02] that you are looking
to accomplish.
- [08:04] That type of digital
employee is just priceless
- [08:07] because it can sort
through all of the noise,
- [08:09] sort through the systems, all
the data that it has access
- [08:11] to in order to go grab what
it needs, reason across that,
- [08:15] and come back and
say, Hey, boss,
- [08:17] I think I've got
something here for you.
- [08:19] And that's the idea of hiring
your first digital employee
- [08:22] that can do that type of work.
- [08:24] MOLLY WOOD: I want that.
- [08:25] I want that!
- [08:26] Are you and your team
- [08:27] at Microsoft already
using digital employees
- [08:29] like this day to day?
- [08:31] JARED SPATARO: We absolutely
are just starting to do that.
- [08:33] In fact, on my team, there's a
data scientist, Alex Farach,
- [08:37] who has created three
agents to assist him
- [08:40] with the Work Trend Index,
which is really exciting.
- [08:44] One agent goes online every day,
- [08:45] scoops up some
relevant new research.
- [08:47] Another assists with
statistical analysis.
- [08:49] He has a third one that
drafts really rich briefs
- [08:53] to help him connect the dots.
- [08:55] So imagine that, he has started
to command, if you will,
- [08:58] a team of agents that
are helping him.
- [09:00] These are digital employees to
help him to get the work done.
- [09:03] So, pretty exciting to
see it come to life.
- [09:06] I'm just starting to
do that same thing.
- [09:08] Typically, mine is much
more oriented towards the
- [09:10] interactions I'm having with
customers as I'm starting to
- [09:13] get up to speed or try to
figure out how I can work
- [09:15] with a particular customer.
- [09:17] MOLLY WOOD: What does this
start to look like day to day
- [09:19] for knowledge workers?
- [09:20] What does a typical workday
look like for someone
- [09:23] who has AI agents performing
tasks on their behalf?
- [09:26] It's like a view from
the future, if you will.
- [09:28] JARED SPATARO: Well, let's
start with the present and
- [09:31] then we'll go to the future.
- [09:32] Presently, we know
through our telemetry
- [09:35] that almost all
professionals start
- [09:37] and end their day in
email or on Teams.
- [09:39] So in other words, in
communication tools.
- [09:40] It makes a lot of sense,
- [09:42] we're kind of checking
in with colleagues.
- [09:44] But we think that the
way this will happen is
- [09:46] that people will have a personal
assistant. We call that Copilot,
- [09:49] and that personal assistant
will be how you start and
- [09:52] end your day, because it will
be infinitely better than kind
- [09:55] of a single-threaded
communication tool
- [09:57] at providing you a view of all
the work that you're doing.
- [10:01] That personal assistant also,
most importantly, will
- [10:04] essentially, be your window  
into the world of digital
- [10:07] labor, or the world of
agents, if you will.
- [10:09] And we believe that window,
the ability of a Copilot,
- [10:13] for instance, to orchestrate
all of the agents
- [10:16] that are getting work
done on your behalf,
- [10:17] that's where the
power will come in.
- [10:20] MOLLY WOOD: Stepping
back, I think a lot
- [10:21] of employees are wondering if
digital employees are going
- [10:24] to assist human employees
or replace them.
- [10:28] So the question on everyone's
mind, of course, is
- [10:32] what happens to jobs?
- [10:34] JARED SPATARO: I see it
this way. First off,
- [10:35] 80% of the global workforce,
both employees and leaders,
- [10:39] say that they're lacking
enough time or energy
- [10:41] to get their work done.
- [10:42] So you have to look at it for a
moment and recognize the moment
- [10:46] that we're in, the context
in which we're operating.
- [10:48] So I believe we need
intelligence on tap.
- [10:52] And the way I think of it is we
have too many problems to solve,
- [10:56] too many things to work through,
too many challenges to tackle,
- [11:00] and this is such an important
time as you look at the history
- [11:03] of business, as you look at
the history of the world.
- [11:05] So, we look at this
and say, man,
- [11:08] our brightest days
are yet ahead.
- [11:09] We look at the ability
for digital employees
- [11:12] to not only help us cut costs,
but also help us innovate
- [11:15] as we look at everything
from energy to some
- [11:17] of the most pressing problems
that humanity faces.
- [11:20] That's where we get excited
- [11:22] that these digital employees
will really help us.
- [11:25] MOLLY WOOD: So how should
leaders and employees think
- [11:27] about their own agency as more
and more work teams have humans
- [11:32] and AI agents collaborating?
- [11:33] Some people aren't thinking of
this in terms of business value
- [11:36] and opportunities, they're
imagining scenarios
- [11:39] from science fiction.
- [11:41] JARED SPATARO: That is,
certainly the narrative
- [11:42] that I see often in the press,
because it taps into Hollywood.
- [11:48] I think it does tap
into our fears.
- [11:50] This technology is not something
where you click a button
- [11:52] and it's wired into every
one of your systems
- [11:55] and it can do everything
without your help.
- [11:57] And so I think human agency
here is incredibly important.
- [12:01] You can hire your first
digital employee, but you have
- [12:03] to onboard the thing,
you have to connect it
- [12:05] up to your systems, you
have to tell it what it can
- [12:07] and can't do, you
have to watch it ramp
- [12:10] up into your organization.
- [12:11] So I'm excited about this moment
- [12:14] because I think it will all
be guided by human agency.
- [12:16] Nothing's going to happen here
without humans recognizing,
- [12:20] wow, this is my opportunity
to leave my mark on history,
- [12:24] to leave my mark on
humanity, to do something
- [12:27] that will be a pattern
that we're going
- [12:29] to follow for decades to come.
- [12:31] So I hope people are energized
by it. I hope they don't think
- [12:35] that it's a fearful thing.
- [12:36] Instead, I hope they
really recognize
- [12:38] that it's an opportunity
for leadership
- [12:40] and for a lasting mark on
the history of the world.
- [12:45] MOLLY WOOD: So you mentioned
that in the past,
- [12:48] some of the AI revolution has
been driven from the bottom up,
- [12:51] from employees bringing ideas
in. Now it really is the role
- [12:55] of leaders and managers
to implement this change
- [12:58] and bring people on board.
- [12:59] How does this change
the role of managers,
- [13:02] not just from an
adoption perspective,
- [13:05] but also managing human
- [13:07] and digital employees
at the same time?
- [13:09] JARED SPATARO: Well, let's start
from the role of managers.
- [13:11] I think the theory of the firm
has been predicated on this idea
- [13:15] that you organize around the
labor and how it uses capital.
- [13:19] You know, those are the
economic basics.
- [13:22] Now, all of a sudden, the theory
of the firm actually changes
- [13:24] because a manager is meant
to allocate resources
- [13:28] that now include
this intelligence
- [13:30] on tap to produce outputs.
- [13:32] And that means that,
literally, a manager has
- [13:34] to learn a whole new skill
set, not only depending
- [13:37] on what you're doing, how do you
create kind of the processes,
- [13:40] if you will, to get
something done,
- [13:42] but where do you
stick human talent?
- [13:44] Where do you stick this
intelligence on demand?
- [13:46] How do you coordinate
between those things?
- [13:48] I mean, I think it's
a whole new era
- [13:51] that will be opening up here.
- [13:53] Very exciting.
- [13:54] MOLLY WOOD: I could imagine
that that would apply
- [13:56] to younger employees too.
- [13:58] JARED SPATARO: My
theory is that really
- [14:00] educational institutions
are going to start to need
- [14:03] to think about, how
do we essentially
- [14:05] produce early-in-career
talent that works as well
- [14:11] as mid-career talent used to?
- [14:13] In other words, during their
education, how do they learn
- [14:16] to become the boss of agents,
such that they are able
- [14:21] to command a team, able
to produce the same type
- [14:23] of work a medium- or a
large-sized team would produce.
- [14:27] Because they know how to
delegate, they know how
- [14:28] to judge work, they know how
to pull it back together.
- [14:31] They know how to send things
back to be done again.
- [14:33] That's usually stuff that takes
10, 15 years in the workforce
- [14:36] to learn just by practice.
- [14:39] And we expect, I expect,
- [14:40] that early-in-career folks will
be able to do that work now
- [14:43] with the aid of these tools.
- [14:45] So in many ways, I think we're
making every employee a manager,
- [14:49] every employee a leader.
- [14:51] And that's a very
different change.
- [14:53] Today, a lot of knowledge work
happens at the leaf nodes.
- [14:57] People who have to kind of get
the work done all on their own,
- [15:00] whether they're an analyst
or a writer or a designer.
- [15:04] And what we're,
essentially saying is, all
- [15:05] of those jobs are going to turn
into managerial jobs where
- [15:09] certainly, you can do
the work if you want to,
- [15:10] but you will find you get more
done, you produce better work,
- [15:14] when you orchestrate agents
to go get that work done.
- [15:18] MOLLY WOOD: In fact, one of
our recent podcast guests,
- [15:20] Harvard Business School
professor Karim Lakhani,
- [15:23] just co-authored a paper called
"The Cybernetic Teammate."
- [15:26] You've said you're pretty
excited by some of its findings.
- [15:28] Right?
- [15:29] JARED SPATARO: Man,
I love this study.
- [15:31] This is a study I can't
help but cite as I work
- [15:33] with management teams.
- [15:36] Probably the most important
finding of this study
- [15:38] from my perspective is that
a single person equipped
- [15:40] with AI can perform as
well as an entire team
- [15:44] of people not equipped with AI.
- [15:45] And we're just getting started.
- [15:47] But it was specifically a field
test, Molly, that was done
- [15:52] with Procter and Gamble, so it's
real work in the real world,
- [15:56] and I just think that
finding is remarkable.
- [15:59] I think we'll come back to it in
five, 10 years and say, yeah,
- [16:02] that was the beginning.
- [16:03] We saw it right there.
- [16:03] We saw a spark of what the
future was going to be.
- [16:07] MOLLY WOOD: It strikes me
that we're talking about this
- [16:09] in such a matter-of-fact way.
There are digital employees,
- [16:13] you have cybernetic teammates,
intelligence is now on tap.
- [16:17] Can you give us your perspective
on the tech advancements
- [16:21] that got us to the point
where we're discussing this
- [16:24] in such a commonplace way?
- [16:25] JARED SPATARO: It's caught
so many of us by surprise
- [16:27] because it's
happened so quickly.
- [16:29] Go back to November of 2022,
ChatGPT is introduced.
- [16:33] Remember, at that point,
we're still not sure
- [16:35] if technology can
pass the Turing Test.
- [16:38] In other words, could it respond
to questions from humans
- [16:41] in a way that we could not
determine if they were a human
- [16:44] or a machine on the other side?
- [16:46] You know, that was the question
in November of 2022.
- [16:48] MOLLY WOOD: Yeah.
- [16:49] JARED SPATARO: Well,
we found it could.
- [16:50] We also started to see the just
early glimmers of reasoning.
- [16:55] It wasn't just answering
questions, but it looked
- [16:57] like it was actually kind of,
in a reasoning type of way,
- [17:02] mimicking what humans
do to answer questions.
- [17:05] And that was exciting for us.
- [17:06] Then fast-forward,
the models continued
- [17:08] to get more and more capable,
- [17:09] but fast forward essentially
- [17:11] to December of last
calendar year, of 2024,
- [17:14] where OpenAI introduced
the first reasoning model.
- [17:17] This was a model that was
trained on what we call
- [17:21] chain-of-thought types of 
patterns, where we were
- [17:24] literally saying, now we want 
to train you to reason.
- [17:26] We actually want to
show you what it looks
- [17:27] like to do good analytical and
mathematical reasoning and see
- [17:30] if we can train you to do that.
- [17:32] o1 was the first
model that did that.
- [17:34] It proved to be just kind
of mind blowing for us.
- [17:36] o3 is the current
best tech out there.
- [17:39] It is now outperforming and
demonstrating what we call
- [17:41] superhuman intelligence, Molly,
- [17:44] meaning humans cannot outperform
it in particular domains.
- [17:48] And that's I think why
we're all, all of a sudden,
- [17:50] matter of fact. We saw the
glimmers of reasoning come on.
- [17:53] We saw the models get better and
then, bang, over the last couple
- [17:56] of months we're in this place
where, with our best thinking,
- [17:58] we're not sure we can
outthink the machines.
- [18:02] And that's pretty exciting.
- [18:03] I think it leads us
to imagine what we can do
- [18:06] with this technology to
really further our dreams
- [18:10] about what we can do
for the human family.
- [18:13] MOLLY WOOD: I want to ask
you about the ROI of AI.
- [18:16] How are firms performing,
particularly firms
- [18:20] that are starting out with
AI or really evolving into,
- [18:22] or starting as Frontier Firms?
- [18:24] JARED SPATARO: Well,
- [18:25] truly Frontier Firms are
outperforming their peer group
- [18:29] or their industry set in
really exciting ways.
- [18:32] One of the key measures that
we see that just gets right
- [18:34] to the heart of things is
- [18:36] essentially revenue
per employee.
- [18:38] That's an important measure
for almost every industry,
- [18:40] because you're looking at
how you're deploying capital
- [18:43] and people to get things done.
- [18:44] And in some of these places, we
are starting to see them do 4x,
- [18:50] 10x, or more per employee.
- [18:51] And that's just simply because
it's a really different setup,
- [18:54] Molly.
- [18:54] I mean, they start
and say, well,
- [18:56] why would you need
these types of roles?
- [18:58] I know of one of these
Frontier Firms, for instance,
- [19:00] that decided not to hire a
CFO simply because they felt
- [19:04] like they had enough
analytical understanding and,
- [19:06] using an agent to aid
that they were able
- [19:08] to get the specialized
skills that they needed.
- [19:10] I know another one that decided
to not hire a CMO, but, instead
- [19:14] hire someone who was earlier
in career and say, hey,
- [19:17] we believe in you
with these tools, we think
- [19:19] you can perform as well
- [19:20] as any seasoned veteran
would be in marketing.
- [19:23] Those types of decisions
kind of lead you there.
- [19:26] And then you start to get
from revenue per employee
- [19:30] to just some of the key measures
in a particular industry.
- [19:33] I have seen the legal
profession really start
- [19:35] to undergo some big changes.
- [19:38] Lawyers are all
about essentially
- [19:40] how much they can bill per hour.
- [19:42] Well, all of a sudden, when
you have intelligence on tap,
- [19:44] that doesn't even make
sense as a way of thinking
- [19:46] about the business
model any longer.
- [19:48] And so there's another
place that we're starting
- [19:50] to see entire business
models change.
- [19:53] So it starts with the most
basic of just looking
- [19:56] at how much you're
driving per employee.
- [19:58] But I think we're going to
start to see big changes even
- [20:00] in the models that people use
- [20:02] to monetize what
value they produce.
- [20:05] MOLLY WOOD: It feels
like that ability
- [20:06] to quantify is so important.
- [20:09] It's so valuable to say,
- [20:10] this is why you can't
stay in the middle.
- [20:13] JARED SPATARO: Well,
here's what's happened
- [20:14] that I think has
been so interesting.
- [20:15] I mean, all along the way I
feel like I've learned things
- [20:19] where I look backwards
and say, of course
- [20:21] I should have known that.
- [20:22] So let me just trace
Jared's history here.
- [20:25] You know, we came out with a
digital assistant
- [20:26] that was saving people
first 20, then 30,
- [20:29] then the good people can use
Copilot 40 hours a month.
- [20:32] But guess what?
- [20:32] Most CFOs said, That's cute,
but I don't really have a way
- [20:36] of quantifying that
to the bottom line.
- [20:38] It doesn't impact
revenue and opex
- [20:40] as directly as I wish, Jared.
- [20:42] That makes sense to me.
- [20:43] So then we moved over to 
process re-engineering
- [20:46] where people were like,
Hey, pick a process,
- [20:48] something like customer support.
- [20:50] And with that process, can
you use this technology
- [20:52] to really impact costs
in a measurable way?
- [20:56] And they were, for sure.
- [20:58] The biggest problem
was you can only pick
- [20:59] so many processes a quarter, in
a year, and get that work done.
- [21:03] The sweet spot that we found has
been this idea of digital labor
- [21:07] and digital employees,
- [21:08] and that's because I
believe everything
- [21:11] in a firm today is really
tooled around an employee.
- [21:14] We all get what it looks like to
hire and onboard an employee.
- [21:17] We know what the costs are. We
call them a fully burdened cost
- [21:20] for an employee. Everybody
speaks that language.
- [21:23] You tell me I can add the
equivalent of five employees
- [21:27] to my team without
all of those costs,
- [21:30] I know how to do
the math on that.
- [21:31] And that's where I think
we've hit a sweet spot
- [21:34] of how we will be able to
quantify, measure consistently
- [21:38] in the frame and the system
that we've already set
- [21:41] up the impact of
this technology.
- [21:43] So I think it's a really
interesting maturity point
- [21:46] in just the world
absorbing the technology,
- [21:49] measuring the impact
of the technology.
- [21:52] MOLLY WOOD: You are someone who
specifically has seen a lot
- [21:55] of technology transformations.
- [21:57] What can we learn from the times
- [21:59] that we have been somewhere
like this before?
- [22:02] JARED SPATARO: The
one that I go back
- [22:03] to that I have the most
experience with is the internet.
- [22:07] It's really fun to go back and
look at people's predictions
- [22:11] as the internet started to
move out of the laboratory,
- [22:14] out of research, and into
a commercial setting.
- [22:17] And I would say the shape of
what I have studied there,
- [22:21] the impact on society, I
feel like we're going to see
- [22:24] that same thing happen here.
- [22:27] I believe that, when you
look at the internet,
- [22:29] no one would say the internet's
been bad for humanity.
- [22:32] We all think, man, our
lives are much better.
- [22:34] At the same time, we can
also look at some things
- [22:36] that we should have done
early on with the internet.
- [22:39] I look at an example of
something like social media.
- [22:42] And so I think that some of
those same patterns apply here.
- [22:44] So I just think that going back
to look at what's happened,
- [22:47] particularly with the
internet, really provides us
- [22:49] with a good model
that'll help guide some
- [22:52] of what we need to
do with this tech.
- [22:54] MOLLY WOOD: If you are willing,
- [22:55] can you tell us how
you're starting
- [22:56] to see AI be incorporated
outside of work?
- [23:00] I have heard, for example,
you may have used it
- [23:02] to help you learn Spanish.
- [23:04] JARED SPATARO: I have been
using it to learn Spanish.
- [23:06] I love this thing for
language learning, because
- [23:09] up to this point you've had
to find a way to hire
- [23:12] or become really good friends
with a native speaker
- [23:15] so that you can practice.
- [23:18] I love just conversing with it.
- [23:19] And then you can set
it up and say, Hey,
- [23:21] I want you to converse with
me about these topics, but,
- [23:23] if I make mistakes, I want
you to pause for a second,
- [23:26] kind of pause the conversation
that's happening,
- [23:29] just correct me and then we'll
go back to the conversation.
- [23:31] So I ask it things about
single-cell biology,
- [23:34] I ask it about the
finer points of dining.
- [23:37] I mean, you can just
ask any specialty topic
- [23:40] and it comes back to you,
which is really fun.
- [23:42] But in general, I would say
that that's what I see outside
- [23:45] of work. People starting to use
it to learn about new things,
- [23:48] to augment their
understanding of the world,
- [23:51] to create opportunities to
expand what they think about
- [23:55] and what they're processing.
- [23:56] I mean, all of that's
very exciting to me.
- [23:59] MOLLY WOOD: So, knowing
that we're in this moment
- [24:01] of profound change,
what is your advice
- [24:05] for business leaders today?
- [24:07] JARED SPATARO: Yeah,
that's pretty easy.
- [24:08] I mean, I'd say hire your first
digital employee this week.
- [24:11] You need to get after this.
- [24:12] The idea that this is months
off, that was like last year.
- [24:18] This year you can hire your
first digital employee.
- [24:20] So I'd say that's the first one.
- [24:21] Number two, what that
introduces then is this idea
- [24:24] of human-agent teams.
- [24:26] And so I think you
need to start thinking
- [24:28] about your human-agent ratio.
- [24:30] You know, that should be a
really good measure.
- [24:32] We don't know exactly what
that should look like,
- [24:34] but it will be a measure
- [24:35] of how you're deploying
this technology.
- [24:38] And then the last thing I'd
say is, once you start to see
- [24:41] that pattern take shape, you've
got your first digital employee,
- [24:44] you're starting to
see them proliferate,
- [24:45] you've got human-agent
teams, you need to think
- [24:48] about every team and every
process. Like, don't just
- [24:50] have it be localized. You 
know, if you don't do it,
- [24:52] your competitor will be 
doing it. So there is
- [24:55] a sense of urgency that
I think is important
- [24:58] for business leaders to
feel at this moment here
- [25:01] in the spring of 2025.
- [25:03] MOLLY WOOD: This is a
high bar because a lot
- [25:06] of exciting things
are happening.
- [25:08] What excites you the
most about this moment?
- [25:14] JARED SPATARO: I feel like
humanity's hit a point
- [25:16] where we have been facing some
challenges that have been almost
- [25:20] like brick walls. Whether that
is how to cure cancer or how
- [25:25] to truly eradicate poverty,
how to really grow GDP around
- [25:31] the world in a way that's both
sustainable and shareable.
- [25:36] You know, some really 
important questions.
- [25:39] And I think we've hit that brick
wall because I think it's fair
- [25:42] to say that we've reached the
limitations of our ability
- [25:44] to work through them on our own.
- [25:46] I think what excites me the
most is with this technology,
- [25:50] we can tackle those things.
We can invent new drugs.
- [25:54] We can invent new energy
technologies. We can create
- [26:00] ways for the people who have not
traditionally had access
- [26:04] to specialty training and
education and capital
- [26:09] to create firms that flourish
right out of the gate.
- [26:14] I don't know, you put
those things together,
- [26:15] they are very hopeful.
- [26:17] It does feel to me
like a new chapter
- [26:20] in the history of mankind.
- [26:23] I don't know, if you don't
get inspired by that,
- [26:25] I don't know what I have to
offer you to be inspired by.
