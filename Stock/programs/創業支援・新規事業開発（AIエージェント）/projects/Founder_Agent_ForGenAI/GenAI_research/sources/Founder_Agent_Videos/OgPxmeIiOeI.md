- [00:00] So far I have received many questions
- [00:02] asking when am I releasing separate jai
- [00:05] and agenti course for those who wants to
- [00:07] learn just that topic. Well, I'm glad to
- [00:10] announce that this course is now live on
- [00:13] codebasics.io. This course is perfect
- [00:16] for those who have some programming
- [00:18] background. Let's say you are a software
- [00:19] engineer and you want to learn genai
- [00:22] quickly without spending too much time
- [00:24] then this course is ideal for you. But
- [00:26] let's say you want to become a
- [00:28] full-fledged AI engineer or geni
- [00:31] engineer and you have patience to spend
- [00:34] time in learning different modules such
- [00:36] as math and statistics, statistical
- [00:39] machine learning, deep learning etc. in
- [00:42] detail then you should pursue our ji
- [00:45] boot camp. Okay. So the boot camp is a
- [00:48] long-term program that will go over all
- [00:52] math concepts, deep learning,
- [00:55] statistical learning, Python, everything
- [00:57] in detail. So that boot camp is for
- [01:00] those people who want to become AI
- [01:03] engineer or or let's say geni engineer
- [01:05] and have patience to learn all the
- [01:09] modules in a comprehensive way. But the
- [01:11] course that we are launching today geni
- [01:13] and agentic AI is perfect for those who
- [01:16] have some knowledge on these
- [01:18] fundamentals and who want to learn geni
- [01:21] and agentic AI quickly. Let me give you
- [01:23] a content overview quickly. So I'm going
- [01:26] to do that so that you get an idea on
- [01:28] what is covered. The course contains lot
- [01:30] of business projects as well. So there
- [01:32] is lot of practical learning concepts,
- [01:35] exercises, quizzes, lot of coding as
- [01:37] well. Okay. So we'll go over content
- [01:39] overview. Now let me give you a quick
- [01:41] content overview. We will begin with
- [01:44] theoretical fundamentals where we'll
- [01:46] talk about what is AI, ML, statistical,
- [01:48] ML, deep learning, how these things are
- [01:50] related. Now if you know all these
- [01:52] concepts then you can skip this entire
- [01:54] chapter but if you don't know then this
- [01:57] will help you refresh this fundamentals
- [02:00] very quickly. We'll also talk about
- [02:02] machine learning and deep learning
- [02:04] fundamentals a bit more in detail where
- [02:07] we'll cover things like what is
- [02:09] regression, what is classification,
- [02:10] supervised learning, unsupervised
- [02:12] learning and so on. Then in the third
- [02:14] chapter we will begin discussing the
- [02:17] fundamentals of genai and agentic. Okay,
- [02:20] what is geni? What is the difference
- [02:22] between geni and traditional AI? What
- [02:25] are agents? What is agentic? Right? So
- [02:27] these are the terms that we will get a
- [02:30] very good understanding on and then uh
- [02:32] in the fourth chapter we will go in
- [02:35] depth for geni. Okay. So if you look at
- [02:38] the entire curriculum there are geni
- [02:40] chapters. So chapter 4 5 6 7 8 9 and
- [02:44] then there are agentic chapters. So all
- [02:46] these four chapters. So in jai key
- [02:49] concepts you will obviously learn how
- [02:51] LLMs works context window all those
- [02:54] concepts like rag vector database and so
- [02:58] on each of these chapters will have quiz
- [03:01] and exercise so that you are practicing
- [03:02] the concept that you are learning and we
- [03:05] have included also a chapter summary
- [03:07] where you'll see this kind of nice PDF
- [03:09] which you can download or print to get a
- [03:13] quick overview of the concept that you
- [03:16] want to refer to. So let's say you're
- [03:17] preparing for interviews or in general
- [03:19] for your knowledge you want to refer to
- [03:21] these concepts and these PDFs will be
- [03:23] extremely useful. In chapter 5 we start
- [03:26] discussing lang chain. Langchain is a
- [03:28] popular framework that people use to
- [03:30] build gen applications and here we have
- [03:33] used
- [03:34] grogma. Ola is a way to run things
- [03:38] locally. You can run local lm. Then uh
- [03:42] we have discussed uh the detailed
- [03:44] fundamentals such as prom templates,
- [03:46] output parser and so on. Then we
- [03:49] immediately move to vector databases
- [03:51] where we discuss chromb. There are many
- [03:54] other vector databases like mil and
- [03:57] quadrant and so on. Once you learn one
- [04:00] vector database learning others should
- [04:02] be easier and this is open source. So
- [04:04] for your learning uh I think chromad is
- [04:08] a perfect database that you can start
- [04:09] with. In chapter 7 and 8 we are building
- [04:11] two different projects. So chapter 7
- [04:14] contains a project which is bit simpler
- [04:16] but chapter 8 contains a detailed
- [04:19] project where we have given a simulation
- [04:21] of how these projects are executed in
- [04:23] the industry. You start with scope of
- [04:27] work document. Uh so let me just show
- [04:30] you here by forwarding this. We have
- [04:32] also discussed the technical
- [04:33] architecture and so on. Okay. So see and
- [04:37] we used flipkart website where you build
- [04:40] this kind of chatboard for flipkart
- [04:43] where you ask a question and it will
- [04:44] give you all the necessary information.
- [04:47] Okay. Uh and we have created scope of
- [04:49] work document where you mention project
- [04:52] pipeline the deliverable success
- [04:53] criteria and so on. So you are not only
- [04:56] learning technical things you get
- [04:58] insight onto how projects are executed
- [05:00] in the industry. This is how we execute
- [05:03] projects. Even in my AI services company
- [05:05] Atlake Technologies, we create a scope.
- [05:08] Uh we discuss things about business
- [05:10] stakeholder communication and so on. So
- [05:12] you are learning tech things as well as
- [05:14] some of the soft skills which are
- [05:15] required to become a successful JNA
- [05:17] engineer. Then in this project we have
- [05:19] covered semantic router, streamllets,
- [05:21] SQL light, database setup, all of those
- [05:24] things. Okay, you can you can look at
- [05:25] the curriculum on your own as well. And
- [05:27] then we move on to agentic AI. So what
- [05:30] is agency? you know building agents
- [05:32] using agno and llama open source model
- [05:35] reasoning models and so on. We have also
- [05:38] built a multimodel agent and we have
- [05:40] talked about Google
- [05:41] ADK open AI agent development toolkit
- [05:45] and so on. Then we discussed some of the
- [05:47] architecture and protocol concepts right
- [05:50] from MCP to A2A protocol and things like
- [05:54] that. We have also built some code to
- [05:57] use pre-built MCP servers and we have
- [05:59] built our own MCP server as well. In the
- [06:02] next chapter, we have discussed building
- [06:05] multi- aent system, some design patterns
- [06:08] uh things like that. And in chapter 12
- [06:10] we have discussed uh something very
- [06:12] important which is how do you evaluate
- [06:13] this system because it's pretty hard to
- [06:15] evaluate ji and agenti systems and we
- [06:18] have gone in depth uh and covered safety
- [06:21] and guardrails operational metrics some
- [06:23] of the amazing very industry relevant
- [06:25] things we have discussed and there is
- [06:27] one more project which we are going to
- [06:28] build um so I'm working on it right now
- [06:31] and it will be published soon maybe when
- [06:33] you're watching this video or when
- [06:34] you're buying this course this project
- [06:35] might be there so just go ahead and look
- [06:38] at that project. Then in chapter 14 we
- [06:40] have talked about fine-tuning you know
- [06:42] right from Laura Q laura fine-tuning
- [06:44] llama with unslo and so on and all these
- [06:47] chapters contains quizzes and exercise
- [06:50] so that you can practice the concepts
- [06:51] that you have learned in chapter 15 we
- [06:54] have covered ethics in Genai which is
- [06:56] super important folks data privacy
- [06:59] compliance you know complying with the
- [07:00] laws of the government is super
- [07:03] important and we have discussed all of
- [07:05] that and then we end the course with one
- [07:08] final quiz. So this will be a lot of
- [07:10] hands-on learning. You can see we have
- [07:12] built three projects where you are
- [07:15] practicing the concepts that you're
- [07:16] learning. There are quizzes, exercises
- [07:18] and the explanations that you will see
- [07:21] in this entire course are super easy to
- [07:24] understand. Even u a person with like
- [07:27] very little knowledge can get these
- [07:30] concepts. All right. So that was the
- [07:32] content overview. All right. If you have
- [07:33] any questions then post in the comment
- [07:35] box below.
