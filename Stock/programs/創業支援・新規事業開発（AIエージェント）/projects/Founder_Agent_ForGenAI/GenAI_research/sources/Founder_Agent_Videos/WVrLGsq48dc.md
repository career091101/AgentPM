- [00:00] Yeah, I'm Zachary Krider, director of AI
- [00:02] and innovation at Trellics. Yeah, we're
- [00:03] seeing Agent AI really impact our
- [00:05] industry more from the customer side of,
- [00:07] you know, traditionally they've been
- [00:08] burdened by not being able to find the
- [00:10] right talent or skill set. And Gen AI is
- [00:12] really helping them shore that up, but
- [00:13] they don't have to have a full staff of
- [00:15] 20 30 people to manage their security
- [00:16] infrastructure. They can now do it with
- [00:18] five people now partnered with an AI or
- [00:20] Aentic AI system to help them throughout
- [00:22] the day. So, in our company, we're
- [00:23] actually leveraging Agentic AI to
- [00:25] actually speed up our development life
- [00:26] cycle to allow engineers to develop code
- [00:29] faster. QA code and find bugs and fix it
- [00:31] before it affects our customers. Then
- [00:33] within our products, we're actually
- [00:34] trying to make our products easier to
- [00:36] use to where customers don't have to
- [00:38] understand, you know, a 120 page product
- [00:40] guide. They can now rely on the AI to
- [00:42] actually build out their policies, help
- [00:43] them with deployment and operational
- [00:45] aspects of the actual products
- [00:46] themselves. So, we do sell our software
- [00:48] and services on the AWS marketplace. And
- [00:50] the reason we like selling on the
- [00:51] marketplace, it makes it easier for
- [00:53] customers to buy software on it where it
- [00:55] goes straight to their AWS commit and
- [00:56] they don't have to go through a long
- [00:57] sales cycle. So we're heavy users of ads
- [01:00] bedrock which really supports our AI
- [01:01] strategy both internally of how we're
- [01:04] helping our software engineers but also
- [01:05] in our product and we also use Age of
- [01:07] SageMaker to power all our machine
- [01:08] learning models to help with a lot of
- [01:10] the training and fine-tuning of those.
- [01:12] AWS helps Trelllex be more innovative
- [01:14] because it helps us spell fast and learn
- [01:15] fast by having access to a broad range
- [01:17] of technologies and services within the
- [01:19] AWS platform.
