- [00:00] [Music]
- [00:02] So I'm Matt Marshall and I'm here with
- [00:04] Tim Tully, partner at Menllo Ventures
- [00:07] and with Vjoy Pandy, senior vice
- [00:09] president of Outshift, Cisco's
- [00:11] innovation arm. And uh we're talking
- [00:13] about where the world of enterprise AI
- [00:16] is headed. And many people say it's AI
- [00:18] agents. And so we're here to talk about
- [00:21] that with Tim who's a leading investor
- [00:23] in AI. He's been looking at agents, big
- [00:26] investor in Anthropic, which is the new
- [00:28] cool kid on the on the block in terms of
- [00:30] a leading LLM and and Vjoy who's really
- [00:32] looking at it from the enterprise
- [00:35] implementation side and has a lot to say
- [00:38] around that. So, so welcome guys.
- [00:39] Looking forward to the conversation.
- [00:41] >> Glad to be here.
- [00:43] >> Thanks for having me.
- [00:44] >> Let's talk about what what AI agents
- [00:47] are. What are they? Tim, do you want to
- [00:49] you want to jump in with definition or
- [00:50] vjoy uh in terms of what they are? Sure.
- [00:55] Uh AI agent is any number of of
- [00:58] basically software demons is what I
- [01:01] would call it that can sort of
- [01:02] progressively respond to human agendas,
- [01:05] right? So the most common one that I see
- [01:07] at least in my side of the of the fence
- [01:09] where I operate in venture land is folks
- [01:11] creating um travel agent agents. Um so
- [01:15] hey, I want to travel to Cabo San Lucas.
- [01:17] Please plan me a 7-day vacation. And by
- [01:19] the way, I want to do some deep fea
- [01:21] sport fishing along the way. So the
- [01:23] agent will go out, scour the web, talk
- [01:26] to LLMs, store a bunch of metadata along
- [01:28] the way, progressively run queries
- [01:30] against LLMs, come back to you and
- [01:32] present to you a multimodal sort of
- [01:35] solution for that vacation that you're
- [01:36] looking for. And along the way behind
- [01:38] the scenes, there's just a ton of work
- [01:39] that has to happen to make that work.
- [01:41] And it's happening on your behalf as a
- [01:44] human is sort of the key point there,
- [01:47] >> right? And and they're they're becoming
- [01:49] more important and relevant because of
- [01:51] LLMs, right? Vjoy would you would you
- [01:53] agree the significance?
- [01:56] >> Yeah, I mean I think so I completely
- [01:58] agree with what what both of you said
- [02:00] the way I would think about this is is
- [02:03] the next agents are the next
- [02:04] evolutionary step in generative AI and
- [02:07] there's a lot of AI like agent washing
- [02:10] going on right now in the industry as
- [02:12] well. So there are assistants that you
- [02:14] will see there which people are calling
- [02:16] agents. So in my head there is a pretty
- [02:19] clear definition of what agents are and
- [02:22] like Tim said there is a little bit of
- [02:24] proactive nature to these agents so they
- [02:26] can take action. So that's a big
- [02:28] difference. The other big difference I
- [02:30] would say from assistants is whereas
- [02:32] assistants were somewhat passive as they
- [02:36] collect input either from machines or
- [02:38] humans like you type in a prompt and you
- [02:40] get a response or a machine sends a
- [02:42] prompt and you get a response. In the
- [02:44] case of agents, they are more online
- [02:47] real time. They're always listening and
- [02:49] they're pulling data continuously and
- [02:52] they're pulling inputs continuously. So
- [02:54] that's the second difference I would
- [02:56] say. So think of them as tireless
- [02:59] specialized employees in an organization
- [03:02] that are very specific to certain tasks
- [03:05] and that collaborate together to solve a
- [03:09] bigger business problem for you. You you
- [03:12] you've got you've got the t ticket
- [03:13] flying case, but that you you've got
- [03:15] some other big use cases. You Tim,
- [03:17] you're looking at at these you VJO,
- [03:19] you're you're looking at enterprise use
- [03:22] cases, right? There's marketing
- [03:23] automation, there's uh big one in
- [03:25] customer support. Let's how widespread I
- [03:28] guess I just want to make sure we're
- [03:29] covering on this. Are these agents
- [03:31] potentially?
- [03:34] >> I think I think the the possibilities on
- [03:36] this is is sort of endless. I mean like
- [03:38] like you mentioned, I'm seeing an a
- [03:40] remarkable sort of stream of customer
- [03:42] success companies come through where
- [03:44] they're they're just basically replacing
- [03:47] well replacing and augmenting at the
- [03:49] same time, you know, customer success
- [03:51] teams and and helping them scale out is
- [03:53] is what's happening. It's happening in
- [03:54] marketing automation. It's happening in
- [03:56] code generation as well. I mean, what is
- [03:58] copilot? I in some ways that's an agent,
- [04:00] right? GitHub copilot. It is an agent in
- [04:02] some ways. Maybe it's not by the
- [04:03] strictest definition that we talk about,
- [04:05] but it's an agent that I'm using all the
- [04:07] time and I think you're going to see it
- [04:08] spread across into other forms of
- [04:10] software engineering.
- [04:11] >> No. So, I think if you think about what
- [04:13] Gartner is saying, Gartner is predicting
- [04:15] by 2028
- [04:17] one-third of all interactions that
- [04:20] organizations are going to have with
- [04:21] generative AI are going to be agentic.
- [04:24] And so there is a trend that is going to
- [04:27] happen. So for the seauite the message
- [04:29] here is that you need to be prepared and
- [04:32] it's just 3 years away and there is a
- [04:35] long journey ahead. So you need to start
- [04:37] today with assistance with lowhanging
- [04:41] use cases that don't have a blast radius
- [04:43] which is pretty massive because you're
- [04:45] starting out and then slowly and
- [04:47] steadily move towards use cases that are
- [04:49] more critical. I think in in terms of
- [04:51] the u the the adoption here, if we could
- [04:55] just talk briefly on why they haven't
- [04:58] been adopted as quickly as some would
- [05:00] think, right? The excitement came out in
- [05:03] the in are we are we ready for these? C
- [05:06] can we talk a little bit about that uh
- [05:08] in terms of what the challenges are?
- [05:11] If you think think about where we stand
- [05:14] with generative AI, there's some pretty
- [05:16] fundamental problems that we need to
- [05:19] solve as an industry. So one thing
- [05:22] that's pretty evident to all of us in
- [05:25] the space is that reasoning is still a
- [05:28] little early when it comes to large
- [05:30] language models. So yes, they can build
- [05:32] semantic relationships
- [05:34] uh but they cannot reason and it's
- [05:37] getting better but it it'll take us a
- [05:39] while to get to good reasoning and once
- [05:42] you get to good reasoning you can then
- [05:44] get to good planning. So if you throw an
- [05:46] ambiguous problem or a high level
- [05:48] problem statement at an agent you need
- [05:51] the reasoning and planning to actually
- [05:54] build a set of instructions that they
- [05:55] can go and tackle. So that's one big
- [05:58] area of research. The other thing I
- [06:00] would say is that there needs to be
- [06:02] collaboration between these agents
- [06:03] because you're not going to have a
- [06:05] singular kitchen sink agent that comes
- [06:08] in and solves your entirety of the
- [06:11] business workflow. I mean business
- [06:12] workflows are pretty complicated. So the
- [06:16] hurdle is a little bit higher and you
- [06:18] need a bunch of these agents to come
- [06:20] together, network, collaborate and then
- [06:23] solve a bigger problem and fit within
- [06:25] these business workflows. So I think
- [06:27] that that's where some more work needs
- [06:29] to be done. And then the other big one
- [06:32] is actually I would say trust and
- [06:33] explanability because
- [06:36] just naturally so businesses are a
- [06:38] little bit more
- [06:40] uh careful when they look at generative
- [06:43] AI and they want transparency,
- [06:46] explanability. It is a paradigm shift to
- [06:49] agents where things are more autonomous
- [06:51] and proactive. But we do need to stand
- [06:55] start on the assistant side right now
- [06:57] because if you don't do that then you're
- [07:00] not prepared for what's coming next.
- [07:04] >> I I I think you've I think you've nailed
- [07:05] it. I I think excessive loops is another
- [07:08] problem, right? Where where the agent is
- [07:09] is not happy with the the output, can't
- [07:12] find it, and then it's running up calls
- [07:14] on your on your your cloud service and
- [07:16] it's becoming super expensive. It just
- [07:18] you these these problems then get
- [07:19] amplified each at each step of the
- [07:22] decision-m voy you're referring to right
- [07:24] this this need for better reasoning that
- [07:26] we're still walking through
- [07:27] >> it is a journey and the good news is
- [07:29] that if you solve for the problems of
- [07:33] using generative AI even with assistance
- [07:36] in your organization
- [07:38] you will then end up solving for the
- [07:40] agentic world as well you're seeing them
- [07:43] get better and better their capabilities
- [07:46] are always improving
- [07:48] But businesses are struggling to consume
- [07:50] it because of four big reasons. The
- [07:52] first is like they don't even know which
- [07:54] use cases make sense. So what use cases
- [07:57] should I build it around? How do I
- [08:00] experiment? Is there a virtual sandbox?
- [08:02] That's one. So where do I even begin?
- [08:04] The second thing is how do I customize
- [08:07] it? So once I know the use case
- [08:09] customization we talked about RAD. So
- [08:11] our knowledge bases, the enterprise
- [08:13] knowledge bases, our policies, does it
- [08:15] fit into the active directory that I
- [08:17] might have in the organization? I might
- [08:20] have procured only one or two LLMs. So
- [08:22] can I bring my own LLM to the picture?
- [08:25] So my own LLMs, my own knowledge bases,
- [08:28] my policies, that's the second one. Then
- [08:30] once I did that and I'm happy with it,
- [08:33] then the ROI, I'm spending a ton of
- [08:35] money on this. Is it really am I really
- [08:38] better off? So at the prompt layer, at
- [08:41] the business workflow layer, am I
- [08:43] getting the return on investment at the
- [08:44] business workflow level? And finally,
- [08:47] when all of that is awesome, then I
- [08:49] deploy it. I need trust, safety, and
- [08:51] security. So these are the four big
- [08:53] reasons that we found out. And so we do
- [08:56] have a product called Motific. You can
- [08:59] go to motifific.ai. It's actually a
- [09:02] product that actually allows enterprises
- [09:05] to go through this exact journey and go
- [09:08] through experimentation
- [09:10] through customization through ROI and
- [09:12] then trust safety and security and I
- [09:14] think if you do that even to build out
- [09:17] an assistant you are pretty well set for
- [09:20] the agentic world. So that's the good
- [09:22] news and I think you should just start
- [09:25] today is the way I would think about it.
- [09:27] Tim, Tim, you're no newcomer on the
- [09:29] enterprise side, right? You're Splunk
- [09:30] and you what you're you're looking at
- [09:33] orchestration and and the need for for
- [09:35] elasticity of these things in the
- [09:37] runtime. Could could you talk a little
- [09:39] bit about about what you're you're
- [09:42] seeing there? Would you agree with what
- [09:43] Vjoy is saying?
- [09:45] >> Yeah, I mean I I I agree that the
- [09:47] journey starts with assistance and you
- [09:48] got to sort of start somewhere. I I I
- [09:51] still think that a lot of development
- [09:54] teams are are um they're they don't
- [09:57] necessarily have the tools that they
- [09:58] need to build the best agents that they
- [10:00] want right now. And so I'm on I'm of of
- [10:04] the belief that there needs to be some
- [10:06] kind of like orchestration layer, some
- [10:08] kind of Kubernetes-l like infrastructure
- [10:10] that allows these agents to to run on
- [10:12] like I I I don't think it's, you know,
- [10:14] AWS Lambda style functions of ephemeral
- [10:16] workloads. At the same time, I don't
- [10:18] think it's, you know, the heavy duty
- [10:19] thing that Kubernetes expects and
- [10:21] enforces on developers. I think there's
- [10:23] an opportunity for engineering teams to
- [10:26] go out there and innovate and build some
- [10:27] kind of orchestration layer that runs
- [10:29] agentic workloads on it. And that's one
- [10:32] of the things that I spend a lot of time
- [10:33] as an investor, you know, keeping my
- [10:36] keeping my eye out on is is looking for
- [10:37] a company that's going to go go do that
- [10:39] is is build out the infrastructure layer
- [10:41] for for agents. Like I just don't see it
- [10:44] right now. And I think there's a massive
- [10:45] opportunity for it. agents. Agents are
- [10:47] basically one monolithic blob that can
- [10:50] go ahead and tackle everything within
- [10:52] that one binary. And I think that's
- [10:55] where the world is today. One of the
- [10:57] thesis that we have is to your point
- [11:00] that this agentic framework or workflow
- [11:03] will look like specialized agents that
- [11:07] are pretty thin. almost think of them
- [11:08] like my microservices that come about
- [11:11] and talk to each other in a network and
- [11:14] collaborate and solve a biggest bigger
- [11:16] business problem. That's precisely what
- [11:18] I had in mind is, you know, when I
- [11:19] described that there has to be something
- [11:20] that's between Lambda functions or
- [11:22] ephemeral functions and Kubernetes, it's
- [11:24] it's like this Goldilock solution of not
- [11:26] too hot, not too cold. somewhere in the
- [11:28] middle and it's it's thin agents that
- [11:30] are really great at specific tasks that
- [11:32] are sort oforked together talking to
- [11:34] each other with some protocol that's yet
- [11:35] to be devised or maybe it's being
- [11:37] devised somewhere and I'm not aware of
- [11:38] it but um that you know does some kind
- [11:41] of multiccast broadcast or you know
- [11:43] something like that across the substrate
- [11:45] where it's being orchestrated and
- [11:46] they're able to communicate seamlessly
- [11:48] with each other.
- [11:49] >> So that yeah that's that's great. So, so
- [11:50] we've got a great set of view points
- [11:52] there in ter in terms of conclusions for
- [11:54] how enterprise IT folks other sea level
- [11:58] folks at the decision-m table get ready
- [12:01] for agents. What are the big takeaways?
- [12:03] I mean, I think what one of the
- [12:04] takeaways
- [12:05] >> I mean this is sounds strange but I
- [12:06] think decision makers also have to be
- [12:08] prepared for people to deploy these
- [12:11] things in the enterprise on their own.
- [12:13] Like you know these things are getting
- [12:14] easier and easier to deploy. There's
- [12:17] demand for it. I think that a lot of
- [12:20] your engineers at your favorite at your
- [12:23] favorite company, they're obviously very
- [12:24] bright and they're going to be able to
- [12:25] deploy these agents and you're suddenly
- [12:27] you're going to have, you know, hundreds
- [12:28] of thousands of these things sort of
- [12:29] running around your enterprise and and
- [12:30] you just have to sort of be ready to
- [12:32] deal with that somehow and have some
- [12:33] policies around how you're going to
- [12:35] manage and deal with it.
- [12:37] >> Yeah, I would completely agree. I mean
- [12:38] the the only thing I would add there is
- [12:40] if you really want to get this right,
- [12:42] what I would also suggest is that
- [12:44] organizations look at empowering citizen
- [12:47] developers. These are developers who are
- [12:49] not deep tech developers. These are
- [12:51] developers sitting in HR and legal and
- [12:54] finance and sales because a lot of the
- [12:56] use cases actually are from these sort
- [12:59] of productivity functions within
- [13:02] organizations. Can we as an industry
- [13:04] build tools and software to enable
- [13:06] citizen developers to then build
- [13:09] assistance and agents simply? So that's
- [13:12] number one. And the other thing I would
- [13:14] add there is get your hygiene
- [13:18] going correct or at least figured out
- [13:21] right now. So where's your data? Is it
- [13:23] cataloged? Is it accessible?
- [13:26] Uh is it if it's unstructured data, is
- [13:28] there an easy way to to ingest it in an
- [13:31] AI pipeline? Even if you're just doing
- [13:33] inference side like rag kind of
- [13:36] techniques, it's not easy. So I would
- [13:38] say get your data hygiene together. uh
- [13:41] get your get your identities and access
- [13:44] control together and then start on the
- [13:47] journey with use cases that have low
- [13:49] blast radius.
- [13:50] >> Great guys. So so my takeaway is is get
- [13:53] ready for agents, right? As an
- [13:55] enterprise decision maker, you need to
- [13:57] be setting up your infrastructure to
- [13:59] even if the the technology isn't
- [14:00] necessarily as mature as you want it uh
- [14:02] to to be ready for these things because
- [14:04] they're coming and they're going to have
- [14:05] huge impact.
- [14:06] >> I absolutely agree with that.
- [14:07] >> Yeah, completely agree, Matt. And I
- [14:08] think yeah just start with doing an AI
- [14:11] readiness assessment in your
- [14:12] organization. Empower your citizen
- [14:14] developers and build out a road map from
- [14:17] experimentation all the way to
- [14:18] production deployment starting like you
- [14:20] said with smaller use cases and then
- [14:23] growing over time.
- [14:26] >> Thank you very much guys for joining us.
