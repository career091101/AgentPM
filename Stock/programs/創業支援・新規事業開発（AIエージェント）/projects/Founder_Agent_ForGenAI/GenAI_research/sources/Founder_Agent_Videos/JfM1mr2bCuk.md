- [00:03] it seems like open AI is working on a
- [00:05] new type of agent one of the big AI news
- [00:08] this week is that open AI is developing
- [00:10] a new type of agent that can directly
- [00:13] control the personal computer device to
- [00:15] automate tasks this new type of agent
- [00:17] can handle web-based tasks such as
- [00:20] Gathering public data about set of
- [00:22] companies creating alteries or booking
- [00:24] flight ticket it is designed to perform
- [00:26] more complex personal and work tasks
- [00:28] without needing close provation if this
- [00:31] is true it's going to be huge news cuz
- [00:33] this is fundamentally different way of
- [00:35] building agents unlike how we building
- [00:37] agent now normally we would Define a
- [00:39] very clear scope of the agent could be
- [00:41] manage email and then give agent a list
- [00:43] of predefined tasks like Google search
- [00:45] send Gmail email access LinkedIn or hpot
- [00:49] it normally looks something like this if
- [00:50] you're using function calling agent the
- [00:52] limitation of this type of Agents is
- [00:54] that it is not generic enough every time
- [00:56] if we want agent to be able to access a
- [00:58] new website let's say Facebook we have
- [01:00] to add a new set of tools otherwise
- [01:02] agent won't be able to do it so to some
- [01:04] extent it's still kind of similar to how
- [01:06] we developed software before where humor
- [01:08] will pre-eng engineer those programs or
- [01:10] codes that deliver specific results but
- [01:13] what this new type of agent is doing is
- [01:15] instead of developing different
- [01:16] functions for every single new website
- [01:18] it is trying to access it tries to teach
- [01:21] agent fundamental skills like how to do
- [01:23] a mouse click how to scroll withing a
- [01:25] website or mobile phone how to type and
- [01:27] when to wait for the website or app to
- [01:29] be fully loaded so if you want agent to
- [01:31] perform a task on a brand new website
- [01:33] you don't need to Dev a new set of tools
- [01:35] you just try to get learn how to use
- [01:37] computers and hopefully it can figure
- [01:39] out how to perform task on any new
- [01:41] website and the benefit is very clear if
- [01:43] this works it will be able to handle a
- [01:45] huge amount of longtail use case in a
- [01:47] website without building API and point
- [01:49] for every single one of them and on the
- [01:51] other side most of the websites don't
- [01:53] have any API in Point if you try to
- [01:54] visit a website from your local
- [01:56] restaurant or gym they probably don't
- [01:58] have API in Point open for your agent
- [02:00] call so the ability to simulate real
- [02:02] human interaction on computer device can
- [02:05] really unlock those day-to-day use cases
- [02:07] people can actually have a real personal
- [02:09] assistant they can complete day-to-day
- [02:11] task like other food but Grocery and
- [02:13] many more but this type of agent is
- [02:15] actually not New Concept some of the
- [02:16] most Talent teams already working on
- [02:18] this Pro for a very long time for
- [02:20] example even last year team from hyper
- [02:22] rde developed his personal assistant
- [02:24] which can directly control the web
- [02:26] browser and complete tasks like book a
- [02:28] Resturant for you successfully as well
- [02:30] as open source project like taxi AI
- [02:32] whereas they develop a Chrome extension
- [02:34] they allow GPT 4 directly control your
- [02:36] browser to do basic task like operate on
- [02:39] GitHub searching and play movie on
- [02:41] Netflix or even create Google Calendar
- [02:43] event and earlier this year one of the
- [02:45] most popular Pur self-operating computer
- [02:47] which is developed by Josh bicket from
- [02:49] hyper te it is able to take over not
- [02:51] only browser but the whole computer and
- [02:54] be able to simulate real interaction
- [02:55] like Mouse click Ty to complete pretty
- [02:57] sophisticated task like a wrer Google
- [03:00] dog or squeeing website on Hacker News
- [03:02] Google or GitHub and of course the
- [03:04] rabbit R1 which claim to be able to
- [03:07] control people's mobile phone directly
- [03:09] so this is really not a New Concept but
- [03:11] I didn't really pay lots of attention to
- [03:13] it because my impression before was
- [03:15] those type of agent tend to be quite
- [03:17] slow and inaccurate it feel like it's
- [03:19] not ready for production until recently
- [03:21] I saw a demo from mulon which is another
- [03:24] web agent team where they showcase demo
- [03:26] that seem to complete those web task
- [03:28] extremely faster than where it was last
- [03:30] year so this got me realize that things
- [03:32] probably changed a lot past few months
- [03:35] and got me really interested to
- [03:36] understand how does those system
- [03:38] normally work is this technology
- [03:39] actually ready now and more importantly
- [03:41] as a AI developer what kind of useful
- [03:43] things we can build today with this new
- [03:45] type of agent so I did a bunch of
- [03:47] research to understand the key
- [03:49] components and challenges as well as how
- [03:51] can you use a new open source project
- [03:54] called Web ql to build a universal AI
- [03:57] agent that can script through different
- [03:59] websites and even take actions like
- [04:01] operating Google sheet paste the
- [04:03] research results in and do some
- [04:04] complicated actions like formatting the
- [04:06] data as well as autom say sending out
- [04:09] the spreadsheets in slack I'm going to
- [04:11] unpack all those things for you let's
- [04:13] get it but before we do I want to tell
- [04:15] you about today's sponsor hopspot I know
- [04:17] a lot of people watching this video is
- [04:19] content creator like me or business
- [04:20] owner who are trying to find ways to
- [04:22] leverage AI in your own business and do
- [04:24] it better and quicker than previously
- [04:26] possible so I partner with hopspot to
- [04:29] get this amazing free ebook into your
- [04:31] hands it is called using generative AI
- [04:33] to scale your content operation so
- [04:35] hopspot interviews thousands of
- [04:37] professionals from marketing and content
- [04:39] creation where they articulate key
- [04:41] findings into tools and specific prompts
- [04:43] that you can use to generate ideas and
- [04:45] synthesize research and create powerful
- [04:48] Visual and even get AI to help Market
- [04:50] your content to get more eyeballs on it
- [04:52] I found one part particularly useful
- [04:54] which is how does Google deal with AI
- [04:56] generated content does it actually pany
- [04:59] it if so what it is exactly and it was
- [05:02] extremely useful to me because I
- [05:03] actually run a side project called
- [05:05] crafters. where I use AI agent to scrip
- [05:08] internet find interesting ad projects
- [05:10] and generate blog posts so this
- [05:12] information was extremely useful to me
- [05:14] alongside with many other practical and
- [05:16] useful tips I think you will find this
- [05:19] super helpful as well I put the link in
- [05:21] description below so you can click on
- [05:22] that to get your free ebook now let's
- [05:24] back to our AI agent firstly one thing I
- [05:27] quickly realized is that this type of
- [05:29] web mobile or desktop agent that can
- [05:31] direct control the personal computer
- [05:33] device it's multiple magnitude harder
- [05:35] than normal function calling agent we
- [05:37] building and here's why let's say we are
- [05:38] building a simple inbox manager agent
- [05:41] who can do action like send out a email
- [05:43] if we're using normal function calling
- [05:45] agent all you need to do just quite
- [05:47] predefine function called send email and
- [05:49] pass on email content and then task is
- [05:51] done there's not much room for Arrow
- [05:53] really however if we try to get a web
- [05:55] agent to complete the simple task of
- [05:57] send email it will need to go through m
- [05:59] four different stamps it'll firstly need
- [06:01] to open Gmail.com in the web browser
- [06:03] click search bar search for that
- [06:05] specific email to reply click on the
- [06:07] right email from the search result click
- [06:09] on the reply button type response and
- [06:11] click Send so it takes a lot more steps
- [06:14] to complete even simple basic tasks so
- [06:16] there a lot more room for arrow in this
- [06:18] process cuz any of those steps agent can
- [06:20] went wrong and you also need stronger
- [06:22] memory and reasoning ability because
- [06:24] agent need to remember what it has been
- [06:26] done before so it didn't repeat the same
- [06:28] arrrow again again so in short it is a
- [06:31] lot more challenge to build but if this
- [06:32] ability is achieved it is super exciting
- [06:35] and open up opportunity for multiple
- [06:36] huge market so how does this system
- [06:39] actually works a lot of you might have
- [06:40] question about how can we get agent
- [06:43] actually simulat the real human inputs
- [06:45] like clicking scrolling typing well that
- [06:47] part is actually the easiest part cuz
- [06:49] there are huge amount of Open Source
- [06:50] libraries already there like play right
- [06:52] pop tier appin which is originally
- [06:54] designed for automated testing so it has
- [06:56] to simulate the real human interaction
- [06:59] like scroll clicking typing but now the
- [07:01] same functionality can be used for
- [07:02] agents so the development of those basic
- [07:05] skill and function is pretty easy to do
- [07:07] with those existing libraries the hard
- [07:09] part is getting agent to know how and
- [07:12] when to do those actions accurate
- [07:14] because most of those language model or
- [07:15] multimodel are not really trained to
- [07:18] understand the interface and decide on
- [07:20] the next step to do and also it's
- [07:22] generally not great at give very
- [07:24] specific position and coordinates about
- [07:26] which your are element to click on so
- [07:28] how can get agent to really understand
- [07:31] this user interface humor are saying
- [07:33] deciding on next action to take to
- [07:35] achieve that there are three mean common
- [07:37] ways we either get agent to raise a ro
- [07:39] interface structure file like HTML or
- [07:42] XML or we use multimodel model to look
- [07:44] at the interface screenshot and give
- [07:46] instruction about what should be done
- [07:48] next and of course more sophisticated
- [07:50] team devel mixed mthod to use both
- [07:52] multimodal ability as well as HTML file
- [07:55] let's go through each one of them one by
- [07:56] one the first method is the HTML or XML
- [07:59] based approach which means we'll try to
- [08:01] extract the HTML file of each website
- [08:04] and give those HTML Dom element to the
- [08:06] agent as context so the agent will be
- [08:08] able to understand this is structure of
- [08:10] the website and then decide what to do
- [08:12] next and the first ever web agent is
- [08:14] developing exactly same way by 2022
- [08:17] September which is pre-chat GPT time n
- [08:19] fman developed a web agent using even
- [08:22] gpt3 which is extremely small contact
- [08:24] window and much less cable into
- [08:27] reasoning but it was tried to complete T
- [08:29] like buy stuff on Amazon or Book Table
- [08:31] in certain restaurant or by itself it is
- [08:33] actually pretty amazing that the level
- [08:35] of completion that the model like gpt3
- [08:37] can perform cuz if you compare the
- [08:39] contact window gpt3 is only 2049
- [08:42] compared with what we have now gp4 turbo
- [08:45] is almost 60 times higher with
- [08:48] 128,000 token contact and why contact
- [08:50] window is important is because most of
- [08:52] the HTML file is really messy and full
- [08:55] of noise as a human if you're reading
- [08:57] the RO HTML file it's actually very hard
- [08:59] for you to understand the website
- [09:01] structure and for the task you're trying
- [09:02] to achieve probably only one or 5% of
- [09:05] those HTML file is actually relevant
- [09:07] that's why the way Nate handling it is
- [09:09] instead of sending the RO messy HTML
- [09:12] file it will actually do a lot of clean
- [09:13] up to extract most R information so if
- [09:16] you zoom in a little bit you will see
- [09:18] that the HTML file that it passed onto
- [09:20] gpt3 looks nothing like original HTML it
- [09:23] just extract interactive elements like
- [09:26] links as well as attacks so that it can
- [09:28] has the context and it also give ID for
- [09:31] each element so that gbd3 can give back
- [09:34] comments like start typing in the
- [09:35] element ID 22 with this content CU those
- [09:39] Library like playright can actually
- [09:40] interact with dom elements pretty well
- [09:43] if you give a specific ID so those
- [09:45] method that is based on the interface
- [09:47] structure file like HTML and XML is
- [09:50] actually the most mature method as long
- [09:52] as you have a good way to clean up those
- [09:54] files and only feed the necessary
- [09:56] contact to agent but it also has its
- [09:58] limitation for example you won't be able
- [10:00] to complete task that involve any image
- [10:02] related ability like capture and on the
- [10:04] other side some of the website is just
- [10:06] terribly designed and or have very bad
- [10:09] code here's another team from agent GPT
- [10:11] talking about their experience building
- [10:13] web agent that read HTML file and they
- [10:15] just have a challenge to get agent
- [10:17] understand this website for buying
- [10:19] properties this website has given me
- [10:21] nightmares uh the the the issues with
- [10:23] the HTML encodings are just endless like
- [10:26] for example you see you see this like uh
- [10:28] placeholder text in this input over here
- [10:30] it's actually not a placeholder it sets
- [10:33] dynamically by another element not the
- [10:35] search box by another element that's
- [10:37] somewhere else in the documentary so
- [10:39] that means that when you go and you you
- [10:41] look at this actual element for the
- [10:42] search box you don't actually know what
- [10:44] it is um so that prevents the the the
- [10:46] language model from understanding uh
- [10:49] where to to input it its search barriers
- [10:52] so you sure this HTML and XML based
- [10:55] approach is most matur so far but it has
- [10:57] a lot of problems and limitations but
- [10:59] with the emergence of this new powerful
- [11:02] multimodel a lot of effort has been
- [11:04] spent on using Vision as a way for agent
- [11:06] to understand the interface and give
- [11:08] instruction about where to interact so
- [11:11] instead of feeding agent the original
- [11:12] HML code we can take a screenshot and
- [11:15] send to multimodel model where it can
- [11:17] understand reason and also plan what the
- [11:19] next step should be done then give back
- [11:21] the instruction to locate specific UI
- [11:23] element and then use the library we
- [11:25] mentioned before to do the actual
- [11:26] interaction and the process is pretty
- [11:28] simple but turn out the hardest part of
- [11:30] this approach is locate the exact U
- [11:32] element to interact with and the best
- [11:34] way to understand how the second method
- [11:36] works and involveed is by looking at
- [11:38] self operating computer project works so
- [11:40] self operating computer is a project
- [11:42] aimed to get AI agent to take over your
- [11:45] computer directly and obviously there's
- [11:47] no HTML file that we can send to agent
- [11:49] for your whole computer screen so it is
- [11:51] designed with multimodel model to Star
- [11:53] Wars and they went through multiple
- [11:55] different iterations at the beginning
- [11:57] the first message they use the inter
- [11:59] okay the UI an to interact with is by
- [12:01] taking screenshot and creating gray
- [12:03] system on top of this image so that gbd
- [12:05] 4V can take a look at screen decide on
- [12:08] the button or link that it should try to
- [12:10] click on and give a proxy coordinates of
- [12:12] that specific button so this was the
- [12:14] first version of self-operating computer
- [12:16] inde did has a quite High error rate cuz
- [12:18] GB 4V this model is generally not
- [12:21] designed or trained for this task it is
- [12:23] very bad at positioning elements a few
- [12:25] months later the accuracy improved a lot
- [12:27] by adopting mthod called seta marks so
- [12:30] seta Mark is a method V by Microsoft
- [12:32] where they found that even though at
- [12:34] default gbd 4V is not great at certain
- [12:36] task like counting objects or
- [12:38] positioning specific UI element but by
- [12:40] giving some visual cues like overlay
- [12:42] some annotation on top of this image gbd
- [12:45] 4B can complete those Vision task much
- [12:47] much better and it was quite popular
- [12:49] method that used for vision task like
- [12:51] counting objects positioning specific
- [12:53] button create specific room in your
- [12:55] floor plan where they will annotate
- [12:57] screenshots with a set of Mark mthod so
- [12:59] that gbd 4V can have better guidance and
- [13:01] give more accurate answer about the
- [13:03] specific position of certain button and
- [13:05] this method increased accuracy a lot but
- [13:07] on the other hand when I talk to Josh
- [13:09] who a builder behind self operating
- [13:11] computer he mentioned some interesting
- [13:13] insights the set of Mark works pretty
- [13:15] well for website with probably greater
- [13:17] usability or simple structure but for
- [13:19] website with more condensed information
- [13:21] or more complex structure it didn't seem
- [13:23] to work well for example for hacker use
- [13:26] because all the information are
- [13:27] condensed in a very tight space it is
- [13:29] pretty hard for gbd 4V to pinpoint
- [13:32] specific position to click on that's why
- [13:34] he just released a new version trying
- [13:36] new method use both gbt 4V and OCR model
- [13:39] if you don't know what OCR is it
- [13:41] represent for optical character
- [13:43] recognition it is a very matured AI
- [13:45] technology that has been used to extract
- [13:47] text from image and documents and it is
- [13:50] extremely good at identifying not only
- [13:52] text and also specific coordination of
- [13:55] the text so they use this new method
- [13:57] with a combination of OCR R and
- [13:59] multimodel model like GPT 4V where GPT
- [14:01] 4V will read original screenshots and
- [14:03] output specific command say click on
- [14:06] this text and then we will use OCR to
- [14:08] also read this image but explore the
- [14:10] list of text and its coordination with
- [14:12] this to combine it's significantly
- [14:14] increase accuracy by GPD 4V decide on
- [14:17] the element to click on and OCR to
- [14:19] provide specific coordinates but one
- [14:21] thing to note is that OCR is great at
- [14:23] text but if the user interface has a lot
- [14:26] of non- text button like bookmark share
- [14:29] which is very common on mobile phone
- [14:31] this method didn't work that well but
- [14:33] they also team from Alibaba where they
- [14:35] push this mthod further they add a new
- [14:37] model called clip which specific to
- [14:38] extract coordinates of those icon so
- [14:41] both clip and OCR together they were
- [14:43] able to build mobile agent that can
- [14:45] directly control your mobile phone into
- [14:47] complete task like taking notes browsing
- [14:49] website and YouTube video leave a
- [14:51] comment which Tik Tok for you or even
- [14:53] use Google Map to start navigation so it
- [14:56] was quite impressive progress by using
- [14:58] multiple models together but ideally I
- [15:00] think the way to go is obviously we
- [15:02] don't use multiple models but you
- [15:04] combine all this ability into one model
- [15:06] that does this job extremely well and
- [15:08] there's open source model called cook
- [15:10] agent which is visual language model
- [15:12] that designed specifically for
- [15:15] understanding and interacting with this
- [15:16] GUI screenshots so it is able to not
- [15:19] only understand the interface but also
- [15:21] draw extremely accurate bonding box and
- [15:24] position of UI element to interact with
- [15:26] and this model has shown success in many
- [15:28] different scenario from normal web
- [15:30] browsing interact with mobile phone as
- [15:32] well as specific apps I test out their
- [15:34] web demo with screenshot of capture and
- [15:37] it is able to identify the actual input
- [15:39] to interact with to typing the capture
- [15:41] as well as specific coordinates which is
- [15:43] extremely accurate as you can see from
- [15:45] the screenshot so I think a more
- [15:46] powerful model like cook agent would be
- [15:48] able to really unlock this type of
- [15:50] vision based approach and there are new
- [15:52] research coming up every day in this
- [15:54] space but overall there are three kind
- [15:55] of big problems I personally experienced
- [15:57] a lot of with those web and mobile
- [15:59] desktop agent why speed as we mentioned
- [16:02] before the nature of this type of agent
- [16:04] is going to be less efficient because
- [16:06] for simple task it has to go through all
- [16:08] the steps and actions so speed is
- [16:10] definitely one of the big Challenge and
- [16:11] second is accuracy which is the exact
- [16:13] problem that we just went through
- [16:15] earlier but I'm pretty confident that
- [16:16] this will be resolved with better model
- [16:18] and third is Task completion so quite
- [16:20] often you will observe that those web
- [16:22] agent just getting into some infinite
- [16:24] Loop that's most because they kind of
- [16:26] forget what kind of steps has been taken
- [16:28] before for so they keep bumping into the
- [16:30] same problems again and again so I think
- [16:32] resolving those three things are crucial
- [16:34] for those have a web or desktop agent to
- [16:36] have much more increasing adoption but
- [16:38] with all this limitation today can we
- [16:40] actually build useful her dos with this
- [16:42] web agent approach the answer is
- [16:44] absolutely yes there probably many
- [16:46] different areas you can look into but
- [16:47] one part I'm personally quite interested
- [16:49] in is web scraping so web scraping so
- [16:51] far has been quite manual process
- [16:53] because every website structure is
- [16:55] different and sometimes they change
- [16:56] update as well so companies actually
- [16:58] spend a huge amount of resource on
- [17:00] maintaining the scraper for different
- [17:01] website that they need to continue
- [17:03] access and many of those aggregator
- [17:05] company like hotels.on Skys scanners
- [17:07] spend huge amount of Dev resource to
- [17:09] just maintaining the scrier which breaks
- [17:12] pretty often but with this type of web
- [17:13] agent who can learn how to access
- [17:16] websites in a universal way it is almost
- [17:18] like a universal API that created to
- [17:21] access any website content and for
- [17:22] companies who need to script certain
- [17:24] competitors website recurringly those
- [17:27] problem of speed accuracy task
- [17:28] completion will be less a problem since
- [17:30] the scenario is more predictable the
- [17:32] only problem we need to overcome is
- [17:33] getting this part right how to get agent
- [17:35] to interact with youi accurately there
- [17:37] are few methods I already mentioned but
- [17:39] this new project called Web ql they are
- [17:41] designed specifically to solve the
- [17:43] problem of find and locate UI elements
- [17:45] for agent to interact with for example I
- [17:47] was trying to build a agent that can
- [17:49] navigate website and typ in capture I
- [17:51] had a lot of trouble with this website
- [17:53] because even though GPD 4V can read the
- [17:56] capture successfully for some reason
- [17:57] often failed to to allocate the input
- [17:59] box but with webq basic build a specific
- [18:02] model that I can just pass on both the
- [18:04] website as well as the list of items I
- [18:07] want to allocate in this case it's input
- [18:08] for the capture as well as submit button
- [18:11] for the capture then it will return the
- [18:12] exact Dom element for example this is
- [18:14] capture input and this is a button for
- [18:16] submit capture and accuracy is extremely
- [18:19] high on the other side if I want to
- [18:20] build a script her to get the latest
- [18:22] product listing on Amazon then I can do
- [18:24] the same thing just pass on the list of
- [18:26] information I want which is the products
- [18:28] I can even Define array as well so that
- [18:29] you will know you actually need to
- [18:31] return list of items and for each item I
- [18:33] want to know the product name number
- [18:34] reviews price rating shpping fee after I
- [18:37] type this thing I can just click on get
- [18:38] webq then it will return me the list of
- [18:40] Json file product name or reviews price
- [18:43] point rating and shipping fee across all
- [18:45] the product listed here and what's great
- [18:47] about this is that I can use the same
- [18:49] query on a totally different e-commerce
- [18:52] site but it will still be able to return
- [18:54] exact information I want for product
- [18:55] name number review price rating and
- [18:58] shipping fee and this library is pretty
- [18:59] easy to use I'll quickly show you
- [19:01] example of how to use this and how can
- [19:03] you build a web agent with this Library
- [19:05] they can complete complicated a web task
- [19:07] to scrip the price release date of Tesla
- [19:09] from different countries and put the
- [19:11] search results into a Google sheet and
- [19:14] in end autom send the data back in slack
- [19:17] so let's get it firstly our will open
- [19:19] Visual Studio code which is where we're
- [19:21] going to implement the scripper to
- [19:22] firstly install their SDK so I'll do pip
- [19:25] install web ql and once it's done the
- [19:27] next thing is I also need to install
- [19:29] playr and play right is the open source
- [19:31] library that we're going to use to be
- [19:32] able to interact with web browser so
- [19:34] come back here and type in play right
- [19:36] install Chrome once that part is done
- [19:38] the last thing is we will need to get
- [19:40] the web qrl API key so at moment since
- [19:43] the product is do in beta version it is
- [19:45] not something you can just sign up and
- [19:47] get we can probably go to the Discord
- [19:48] and request access once you get API key
- [19:51] you can come back here and create EMV
- [19:53] file put in your web ql AP next let's
- [19:55] create a file called uh eCommerce
- [19:58] squer py so we want to create a
- [20:01] universal squer for any e-commerce
- [20:03] website it basically have the same flow
- [20:04] for any e-commerce website it will
- [20:06] firstly go to the homepage search for
- [20:09] specific product let's say coffee
- [20:10] machine click on search button and then
- [20:13] return all search results it's actually
- [20:15] very straightforward first they import a
- [20:16] few libraries we're going to use next we
- [20:18] want to use play ride to create a web
- [20:20] driver it basically means it will start
- [20:22] a browser session so that agent can
- [20:24] start interacting with the browser data
- [20:26] and I said headlight to for now so that
- [20:29] we can actually see the browser next is
- [20:30] we want to Define what are the UI
- [20:32] elements that we want webq to return and
- [20:34] I will basic create a variable let's say
- [20:36] home quer and I want to return the
- [20:38] search box and a search button which
- [20:40] basically any e-commerce website will
- [20:42] have on homepage and I just pass on name
- [20:44] search box and search button and then I
- [20:46] will start get agent working with web ql
- [20:49] so I will create a homepage session
- [20:50] query home query this will return actual
- [20:53] UI elements for search box and search
- [20:55] button then set for search box I wanted
- [20:57] to feel in coffee machine after that
- [20:59] step is done I want I want agent to
- [21:01] click on the search button so that it
- [21:03] can jump to the search results for the
- [21:05] actual scripting and let's just try it
- [21:06] out I also put a Time sleep there so
- [21:09] that the browser won't be closed
- [21:10] immediately and let's do python
- [21:12] Ecommerce scerp so you can say open
- [21:14] m.com and start putting coffee machine
- [21:17] and go to search results and you can see
- [21:19] the whole Pur has actually happened
- [21:20] pretty fast and accurate andtime for
- [21:22] different web task you do want to play
- [21:24] different query name to making sure
- [21:25] their model Returns the right results
- [21:27] and there's actually a Chom extension
- [21:29] that allow you to do this test pretty
- [21:31] easily so for example I can go to
- [21:33] amazon.com.au homepage and then on the
- [21:35] left side try to type in the search
- [21:38] query which exactly the same I used in
- [21:40] the code and click on get web ql and
- [21:42] then this will return to results if you
- [21:44] hover it you can see the specific UI
- [21:46] element in the name you can also make it
- [21:48] more explicit to indicate whether you
- [21:50] want to return button or you want to
- [21:51] return input box and if you go back to
- [21:53] code this is basically how it work so
- [21:55] this homepage cury return to UI elements
- [21:58] in the browser the first one called
- [22:00] search box which is text input and
- [22:02] second is search button which is button
- [22:03] and we first take the get agent to fill
- [22:05] in coffee machine for the search box and
- [22:07] then click search button so that's
- [22:09] pretty much it the next thing we want to
- [22:10] do is once agent get to search results
- [22:12] we want to scrip the latest product
- [22:14] listing so I will go back to the code
- [22:16] again we'll create a new query called
- [22:18] search query and I can actually specify
- [22:20] that product is array so it knows that
- [22:22] it need to return multiple different
- [22:24] products and for each product I want to
- [22:25] name the number of reviews price and
- [22:27] rate and again I can actually copy this
- [22:29] query go to this web page paste it in to
- [22:32] see if they actually return the results
- [22:34] I want okay great you can see it
- [22:35] actually returns an array of product
- [22:38] information from product name number of
- [22:40] reviews price rating shipping and
- [22:42] shipping fee so this pretty much confirm
- [22:44] that the naming convention we have here
- [22:45] is pretty good so I can go back to the
- [22:47] code add search results equal to session
- [22:49] query search query this basically means
- [22:51] after it go to the search result page
- [22:54] then run another query to GA perct
- [22:56] information and I'm going to just print
- [22:58] the search results so let's open
- [23:00] Terminal and run
- [23:03] again okay great so it successfully
- [23:06] finish the task and return the list of
- [23:08] the product results so now we can just
- [23:10] create a quick helper function to save
- [23:13] this result into a spreadsheet so at top
- [23:15] I quickly create a function called save
- [23:17] Json at CSV where it will take the Json
- [23:19] data as well as file name and in the
- [23:21] file I predefine list of columns from
- [23:24] product number reviews price rating I'll
- [23:26] try to get the product array by doing
- [23:28] Json data get results get products and
- [23:31] for each product I will extract those
- [23:33] four key information pan to the product
- [23:35] array and write data into a CSV file and
- [23:38] then let's move down here call the save
- [23:40] Json as CSV function by passing on
- [23:43] search result Json data and save the
- [23:45] file into the CSV and in the end I will
- [23:48] do session stop to finish session so
- [23:50] let's draw this
- [23:56] again
- [23:58] so now it return results if we go open
- [24:01] spres you can see the list of product
- [24:03] price rating and number reviews are all
- [24:05] here and one thing to knowe that is I
- [24:07] did experiment with search quy quite a
- [24:09] bit to making sure it return the right
- [24:11] results and every time I change it I
- [24:13] would need to making sure the header
- [24:14] here also match so with this you
- [24:16] basically create a universal e-commerce
- [24:19] product information scripper I can just
- [24:20] create a few variable set top and use
- [24:23] this exact script for different
- [24:25] e-commerce website by just changing the
- [24:27] URL and maybe the file name and then I
- [24:29] can run again so for this time you can
- [24:30] see it open catch.com.au which is
- [24:32] different e-commerce website and again
- [24:34] it successfully perform task of search
- [24:36] for coffee machine and go to the search
- [24:39] results and once finished again you have
- [24:41] new file of all the product information
- [24:43] from this new website so you can
- [24:45] actually easily spin up this script
- [24:46] they're running every day on all your
- [24:48] competit website or try to be the
- [24:50] aggregator of all the coffee machine
- [24:52] information this is a quick example of
- [24:53] how you can use webq to build some
- [24:56] Universal web scripper but apart from
- [24:58] this you can also do quite sophisticated
- [25:00] workflow accurately for here is more
- [25:02] complicated case like the one we show
- [25:04] you at the beginning where you can set
- [25:05] up a script that can extract information
- [25:08] about different countries Tesla price
- [25:10] delivery date and specs regard as the
- [25:13] language they using and it will even
- [25:15] work for some situation like in UAE
- [25:18] where the tax is on different order then
- [25:20] it can go to the Google sheet pting all
- [25:22] those information and even format it
- [25:25] properly and then it will go to SL and
- [25:28] share spreadsheets this example PRI by a
- [25:30] team to Showcase power I won't go into
- [25:32] the details of this I will include the
- [25:34] code in the GitHub link below so you can
- [25:36] go and check out if you're interested
- [25:37] but there's a lot of possibilities I
- [25:39] hope this give you a good idea about
- [25:41] what kind of powerful web agents you can
- [25:43] actually build today I hope you enjoy
- [25:44] this video I'm very excited to see what
- [25:46] kind of interesting web or mobile agent
- [25:48] you start building I also have plan to
- [25:50] build a more Universal web agent still
- [25:53] use web ql but instead of us predefining
- [25:55] all those queries maybe we can get agent
- [25:58] like GPD 4B to look at screenshots
- [26:00] figure out things to query but use web
- [26:02] ql to actually interact with the UI
- [26:04] accurately if this topic interests you
- [26:06] please comment below let me know and I
- [26:08] will make a more in-depth video thank
- [26:10] you and I see you next time
