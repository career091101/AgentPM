- [00:00] We've all been impressed by the launch
- [00:02] of Gemini 3, which is now a
- [00:04] state-of-the-art model across a wide
- [00:06] range of benchmarks from coding to
- [00:08] reasoning to complex problem solving and
- [00:10] much more. It's honestly incredible that
- [00:13] you can now prompt a model to complete
- [00:16] almost any task. But to truly expand its
- [00:19] capabilities, you need to enable Deep
- [00:21] Think. Deep Think uses advanced
- [00:23] reasoning to deliver more qualitative
- [00:25] and sophisticated outputs. It leads
- [00:27] industry standards on rigorous
- [00:29] benchmarks like humanities last exam
- [00:31] scoring a 41 percentage and on ARC AGI
- [00:35] 2. But there's a slight issue. You need
- [00:38] to be subscribed to the Google ultra
- [00:39] plan to access it. And that can be
- [00:42] pretty expensive which you see over
- [00:43] here. Now here's the interesting part.
- [00:46] There's a deep reasoning agent that can
- [00:48] extend models like Gemini 3.0 Pro and
- [00:50] unlock deep think level capabilities.
- [00:53] and it's called Deep Agent by Abacus AI,
- [00:56] which is today's video sponsor. Deep
- [00:58] Agent is a perfect alternative that's
- [01:00] dramatically more affordable and it's a
- [01:03] powerful all-in-one AI agent with a ton
- [01:06] of additional benefits built in. It's
- [01:08] capable of handling high-level complex
- [01:11] tasks and everything from building full
- [01:13] applications to writing depth reports,
- [01:15] creating presentations, and even
- [01:17] connecting to your existing systems to
- [01:19] perform fully agentic workflows. For
- [01:22] example, just take a look at the CRM
- [01:24] dashboard that it was capable of
- [01:26] generating. You may think that this is a
- [01:28] basic CRM, but if you are to go into
- [01:32] each component, you'll realize that this
- [01:34] is a fullon CRM dashboard that is
- [01:37] functional. For example, within the
- [01:38] context, you can go over to a certain
- [01:41] contact like the CTO. You can get a good
- [01:44] overview. You can then go over to the AI
- [01:47] strategy and have it analyze a lead
- [01:49] score which generates analysis to see
- [01:52] the insights for this particular contact
- [01:54] which talks about the signal the score
- [01:57] and you can even generate a meeting
- [01:59] brief get talking points so that
- [02:01] whenever you are to encounter this
- [02:04] particular contact you can talk about
- [02:06] these certain points. This is something
- [02:08] that was fully generated end to end and
- [02:11] it just showcases how if you are to use
- [02:14] the deep thinking mode with the deep
- [02:16] agent, you're going to be able to get
- [02:17] perfect generations that extend the
- [02:20] quality of the model. I'm not just
- [02:22] saying this cuz it's a sponsored video.
- [02:24] This is something that I tend to use on
- [02:26] a day-to-day basis. And with the ability
- [02:29] to access deep agent, which is $10 per
- [02:32] user built monthly, you also get access
- [02:34] to many other things like chat LM, which
- [02:37] is another tool a part of Abacus AI
- [02:39] suite of tools, which is where you can
- [02:41] chat with state-of-the-art models
- [02:43] directly in one unified chatbot. You
- [02:45] also have Abacus AI desktop, which is
- [02:48] their god tier coding agent. This is a
- [02:50] CLI and a code editor that you can
- [02:53] access locally and it is a perfect
- [02:55] alternative to something like cursor.
- [02:57] But to get started now, you can head
- [02:59] over to the Abacus AI deep agent website
- [03:02] which I'll leave a link to in the
- [03:03] description below and you can click on
- [03:05] get started. Before we get started, I
- [03:07] just want to mention that you should
- [03:08] definitely go ahead and subscribe to the
- [03:10] world of AI newsletter. I'm constantly
- [03:12] posting different newsletters on a
- [03:14] weekly basis. So this is where you can
- [03:17] easily get up-to-date knowledge about
- [03:19] what is happening in the AI space. So
- [03:21] definitely go ahead and subscribe as
- [03:23] this is completely for free. After
- [03:25] signing up or signing in, you're going
- [03:27] to be then sent over to the main
- [03:28] dashboard of Abacus AI. What you want to
- [03:31] do next is navigate over to Deep Agent.
- [03:34] And that is simply by heading over to
- [03:36] the Deep Agent chat. And this is where
- [03:38] you can use this agent to practically do
- [03:40] anything. In this case, enable a deep
- [03:43] think mode that can practically tackle a
- [03:45] task further in detail using more
- [03:49] reasoning or more reasoning tokens to
- [03:51] get the task done. Now, like I said,
- [03:54] this is something that enhances any
- [03:56] model's capabilities to use deeper
- [03:58] thinking and further reasoning to get
- [04:00] the best output. And you can see that
- [04:02] with this example where I simply
- [04:04] requested deep agent to build a stock
- [04:06] insights dashboard and it was able to
- [04:09] build out this app end to end providing
- [04:12] us AI insights built inside this app is
- [04:16] also providing us market news. So for
- [04:18] example uh Nvidia's market news you can
- [04:21] see that it is fetching the latest date
- [04:23] which is December 27th and it is also
- [04:27] showcasing live price charts for
- [04:29] different sorts of stocks. So in this
- [04:31] case, Nvidia is listed at 190, which is
- [04:34] the correct price as of today. So you
- [04:37] can see that it is able to handle
- [04:39] everything from fetching live APIs to
- [04:42] integrating various sorts of features
- [04:44] like AI insights, getting you
- [04:46] performance metrics as well as different
- [04:49] sorts of trends. These are some examples
- [04:52] of what you can do with deep agent and
- [04:54] it is something that will work with you
- [04:56] end to end to build out various sorts of
- [04:58] apps with high quality not just basic
- [05:01] models outputting code. It is going to
- [05:04] reason it's going to debug it and it's
- [05:06] going to output the best generation for
- [05:08] you. And something cool that I stumbled
- [05:10] across is that Abacus AI's deep agent
- [05:12] can also build mobile apps by prompting
- [05:15] it to generate various sorts of
- [05:17] backends, reactbased UIs, and it is
- [05:20] something that can be deployed as a
- [05:22] mobile ready app all from a single
- [05:24] prompt. And you can see with this demo
- [05:26] over here where it was able to create
- [05:28] this game within a couple of minutes
- [05:31] from a single prompt. And this is just
- [05:33] another example of what you can actually
- [05:35] do with Deep Asian. So to see it in
- [05:38] action, what I'm going to do is have
- [05:40] Deep Agent use a list of couple of
- [05:42] models to help me tackle this task of
- [05:45] building a sleek mobile first AI
- [05:47] workspace app. It is essentially going
- [05:49] to be a mix of notion, linear as well as
- [05:52] chat GBT. And it's going to have a lot
- [05:54] of other features a part of all three of
- [05:57] these different apps together in this
- [05:59] new app. So you're going to be able to
- [06:01] see that deep agent will first process
- [06:03] our initial prompt. It is going to then
- [06:06] ask us clarification questions and once
- [06:09] we provide those clarification
- [06:11] questions, we're going to then approve
- [06:13] that and then have it work on tackling
- [06:15] this task. So in this case, you can see
- [06:17] that it's going to ask us a couple of
- [06:19] questions. I'm going to simply just go
- [06:20] ahead and click continue as I trust deep
- [06:23] agent and it is going to then
- [06:24] autonomously deploy multiple agents to
- [06:27] help us tackle this task. And that's the
- [06:29] beauty of deep agent because it works
- [06:31] end to end and it enhances any model's
- [06:33] capability to work on enhancing its
- [06:36] reasoning budget to generate the best
- [06:38] qualitative answer or response. What's
- [06:41] great with deep agent is that it is
- [06:43] capable of doing a lot of things where
- [06:46] it can use multiple tools, run terminal
- [06:48] based commands, execute various sorts of
- [06:50] commands like developing the backend too
- [06:53] and you can see that it does this all in
- [06:55] a single shot which is just incredible
- [06:58] cuz it is able to use multiple tools and
- [07:01] get the best output by using them. Now
- [07:03] you can see that it is rapidly using its
- [07:06] coding capabilities to help us generate
- [07:08] all the code that we need to have this
- [07:10] app functional. So it looks like it has
- [07:13] finished coding out our app and it is
- [07:15] truly remarkable guys. Now this is where
- [07:18] it has built out the fullon application
- [07:21] and to end it even debugged it with the
- [07:23] service log. You can also see that it
- [07:26] created a fullon database with a storage
- [07:29] link to it. This is the capability of
- [07:32] the deep think mode enabled with the
- [07:34] deep agent and this is the app that it
- [07:37] generated. Our linear chat GPT and
- [07:40] notion baby has been generated and this
- [07:43] app is remarkable cuz you have the
- [07:45] ability to manage a knowledge base
- [07:48] deploy all of your different tasks as
- [07:50] well as an assistant. So let's get
- [07:53] started with the documents. You can add
- [07:55] in different templates like meeting
- [07:56] notes, product specs, or an empty page
- [07:59] to get started. This is something that
- [08:01] mimics exactly something that you would
- [08:03] see with notion. You have the ability to
- [08:05] add pictures. You can use it directly
- [08:08] within a chatbot. This is where you can
- [08:10] chat with your documents and you can
- [08:12] even edit it and add implementations to
- [08:15] it. But if we go over to the tasks,
- [08:17] you're going to be able to see that
- [08:18] these are a list of different tasks that
- [08:20] have been added. You can add in
- [08:22] different tasks with your voice. You can
- [08:24] use the AI panel to generate new issues
- [08:27] or add in new tasks and you can get
- [08:29] insights on all of this live in action.
- [08:32] So this is where with the sprint
- [08:35] analysis it gives us a good condensed
- [08:37] summary on all of our different tasks,
- [08:40] all of the backlogs that we have, the
- [08:42] high priority tasks based off the tags
- [08:45] that we had. And you can add these
- [08:46] different tags as well. But within the
- [08:48] AI assistance, you can basically ask
- [08:51] different follow-up questions and get
- [08:53] answers based off the context that we
- [08:55] have from our knowledge base as well as
- [08:57] our task. This is an incredible
- [09:00] end-to-end app that I personally could
- [09:02] sell and charge $20 a month and make
- [09:05] some money off of this deep agent app
- [09:07] that I built in nearly just 20 minutes.
- [09:10] This is something that I didn't even
- [09:11] code and it was able to expand the
- [09:14] reasoning budget of our model to build
- [09:17] out this full-on application for us. If
