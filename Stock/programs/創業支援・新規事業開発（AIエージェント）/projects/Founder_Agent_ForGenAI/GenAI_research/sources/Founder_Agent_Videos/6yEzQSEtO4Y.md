- [00:06] Let's move forward towards how we are
- [00:09] going to build an agent workflow, how we
- [00:12] are going to build a multi- aent
- [00:14] scenario and what are some components of
- [00:17] building such agents.
- [00:20] So in order to build an a multi- aent
- [00:22] workflow, we need to have we just need
- [00:26] to remember three things. First is the
- [00:29] nodes.
- [00:31] Nodes are basically your legal agent,
- [00:35] your sales agent.
- [00:39] So nodes are just the Python logic that
- [00:43] actually drives your agent. So this is
- [00:45] just the logic unit that actually drives
- [00:49] your way towards it. Then you have
- [00:52] edges.
- [00:54] Edges are there just to connect the
- [00:56] nodes together. Let's say you talk uh
- [00:59] you let's say you have these edges where
- [01:03] you actually connect all of these nodes
- [01:06] together and then you can sometimes you
- [01:09] can also have conditional edges which
- [01:11] are your decision m makers that you have
- [01:14] to actually
- [01:16] uh enable the decision making within the
- [01:18] graph and then these three principles
- [01:22] are more than enough for actually
- [01:24] building an hands on uh building a multi
- [01:27] Asian workflow.
