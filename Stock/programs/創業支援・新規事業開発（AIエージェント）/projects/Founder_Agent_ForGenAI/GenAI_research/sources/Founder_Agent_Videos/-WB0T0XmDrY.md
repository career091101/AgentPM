- [00:00] This video is brought to you by
- [00:02] Squarespace. What if you could integrate
- [00:04] GPT4 right into your Python app and make
- [00:08] it aware of your business logic, your
- [00:10] data, and your models? Today, I'll show
- [00:12] you exactly how to do this with Pantic
- [00:15] AI, a really nice toolkit that connects
- [00:18] AI with real Python code. And don't
- [00:20] worry, it's not just theoretical. I'll
- [00:22] walk you through an actual example.
- [00:24] Let's dive in. First, what is Pyantic
- [00:26] AI? It's basically an extension of
- [00:28] paidantic that helps you build AI
- [00:31] powered agents. These agents can use
- [00:34] your domain data models. They can access
- [00:37] dependencies like databases or APIs and
- [00:40] they can return structured outputs with
- [00:43] validation. Thus, the Pantic extension.
- [00:46] So, an agent in that sense is an LLM
- [00:48] that's aware of your business context.
- [00:51] And Pentic AI integrates with popular
- [00:54] models including GPT4. Why is this
- [00:56] helpful? Well, if you're just using a
- [00:58] chatbot directly, then you're going to
- [01:00] get unstructured text back, which is
- [01:03] going to be hard to deal with in
- [01:05] production systems. And what Pedantici
- [01:07] adds is that you have type safe outputs
- [01:10] that are validated by Pantic. You have a
- [01:12] clean way to inject uh contextual
- [01:14] dependencies like a database for
- [01:17] example, and you also have the ability
- [01:19] to define tools, custom functions that
- [01:21] the agent can call. And this helps you
- [01:24] build AI systems that go beyond just
- [01:26] being simple chat bots. So let's take a
- [01:28] look at a concrete example in
- [01:30] healthcare. That being said, I'm not a
- [01:32] doctor. I don't recommend you actually
- [01:34] start using this in your hospital, but
- [01:37] theoretically this is possible. Let's
- [01:39] say you're building a triage system that
- [01:42] helps nurses respond to patient
- [01:45] questions. So here is the starting point
- [01:47] of this example. It doesn't use any AI.
- [01:50] So as you can see, I'm using async.io
- [01:52] because well why not it's helpful if
- [01:54] we're sending requests to an API I'm
- [01:57] using a data class to uh represent a
- [01:59] mock database I'm importing environment
- [02:02] variables from aend file in this case
- [02:04] this contains my open AAI API key I'm
- [02:07] not going to show you that file but then
- [02:09] I have a simple mock database very basic
- [02:12] it has a patient class using a data
- [02:14] class for that one a patient has an ID a
- [02:17] name and vital which is a dictionary of
- [02:20] strings to whatever. I'm not saying that
- [02:23] this is how you should model patients,
- [02:24] but it's a simple example. Then I have
- [02:26] my database, which is nothing more than
- [02:30] a dictionary that has two patients with
- [02:33] uh each an ID, a name, and some vitals.
- [02:36] Then I have a helper class that helps me
- [02:38] access some of that data. So here, given
- [02:41] an ID, this is going to give me the name
- [02:43] of the patient, and this method gives
- [02:45] the latest vital of a patient by ID.
- [02:49] Extremely basic, of course. If you have
- [02:51] an actual database, you would fill this
- [02:53] with way more information. You'd have
- [02:55] way more capabilities here. It's just a
- [02:56] basic example. And the only thing I have
- [02:58] now is a main function that creates a
- [03:00] database connection and gets a patient
- [03:03] name and vitals and then prints that.
- [03:06] So when I run this, then this is what we
- [03:08] get. Very basic, right? So now as the
- [03:10] first step, let's set up a bit of
- [03:12] scaffolding for our agent. One thing
- [03:15] that we're going to need is some class
- [03:17] that represents the things that the the
- [03:19] agent depends on. Let's call that triage
- [03:22] dependencies.
- [03:25] And for simplicity, I'm going to use a
- [03:27] data platform.
- [03:30] And what we're going to need is a
- [03:33] patient ID. And we're also going to need
- [03:36] a database connection, right? So that
- [03:38] for any patient, we can access then the
- [03:42] database and do something with it. So
- [03:44] that's what the agent is going to be
- [03:46] dependent on. Next, we're also going to
- [03:49] need to decide what the output of the
- [03:50] agent should look like. So that's going
- [03:53] to be triage output. Not sure why it's
- [03:57] indented here. And since we're using
- [03:59] Pyantic AI, this is where we should rely
- [04:02] on Pyantics base model.
- [04:09] And of course, we're going to need to
- [04:11] import that. So what the output is going
- [04:13] to be actually AI already sort of
- [04:16] indicates that here is that we're going
- [04:18] to have a response text from the chat
- [04:20] agent. We also need a boolean indicating
- [04:24] whether or not this should be escalated
- [04:26] and we're going to need to indicate the
- [04:28] urgency as a number between 1 and 10. So
- [04:31] these are the three things that we are
- [04:34] going to need and we're going to use a
- [04:36] field to give a bit more information
- [04:39] about this. So in this case, the
- [04:41] response text is going to be a field
- [04:44] with a description
- [04:47] and that's the response text for the
- [04:49] triage. And maybe we can actually write
- [04:51] that a bit clearer by saying this is a
- [04:53] message to the actual patient
- [04:56] like so. And then we can do the same
- [04:59] thing for escalate and for urgency. So
- [05:01] whether we should escalate this case and
- [05:03] what the urgency level of this case is
- [05:06] to a human nurse. Don't forget about the
- [05:09] humans. AI. So now we have created our
- [05:12] sort of context for the agent. So this
- [05:14] is what the agent depends on which is
- [05:16] the patient ID and a reference to a
- [05:18] database connection and we defined what
- [05:21] the agent should output response text
- [05:23] whether to escalate and what the urgency
- [05:25] is. Now before I show you how to create
- [05:27] an agent, first want to take a minute to
- [05:29] talk about today's sponsor, Squarespace.
- [05:32] Squarespace is an all-in-one website
- [05:34] platform designed to help you stand out
- [05:36] and succeed online. Whether you're just
- [05:38] starting out or scaling your business,
- [05:40] it gives you everything you need to
- [05:42] claim your domain, build a professional
- [05:44] site, grow your brand, and get paid all
- [05:46] in one place. I've used Squarespace
- [05:48] myself to launch websites for my
- [05:50] businesses. And as someone who builds
- [05:52] software and teaches software design, I
- [05:54] really appreciate tools that are
- [05:55] thoughtfully designed and just work.
- [05:58] It's really easy to get started by using
- [06:00] Blueprint AI, which generates a fully
- [06:02] custom website based on just a few
- [06:04] prompts. There are a ton of templates
- [06:06] that all look really good. After that,
- [06:08] it's trivial to add sections or change
- [06:10] the appearance to your liking and boom,
- [06:12] you have a full professional website.
- [06:15] Squarespace comes with integrated SEO
- [06:17] tools, so you don't need to worry about
- [06:19] optimizing meta descriptions or
- [06:21] generating site maps. It handles all of
- [06:23] that automatically. If you ever try to
- [06:26] get a new dev blog or documentation site
- [06:29] index properly, you know how frustrating
- [06:31] that can be. With Squarespace, it's
- [06:34] baked in. And with the built-in
- [06:37] analytics dashboard, you can track
- [06:39] traffic, engagement, and even revenue if
- [06:41] you're selling something, or you can use
- [06:43] to figure out what landing pages are
- [06:45] working and what needs to be improved.
- [06:48] Whether you're building a site to
- [06:49] showcase your portfolio or launch a
- [06:51] software as a service that you just
- [06:53] vioded, Squarespace makes it incredibly
- [06:56] easy. Head over to
- [06:57] squarespace.com/ircodes
- [07:00] for a free trial. And when you're ready
- [07:01] to launch, use offer code iron codes to
- [07:04] save 10% off your first purchase of a
- [07:07] website or domain. Now, back to the
- [07:10] video. Now, next thing that we're going
- [07:12] to do is define an agent that uses GPT4
- [07:15] that takes our dependencies and then
- [07:17] returns a structured output. And we also
- [07:21] need to supply it with a system prompt
- [07:23] that explains the role of this
- [07:24] particular agent, which is a triage
- [07:26] assistant. So I'm going to create a
- [07:29] triage agent
- [07:33] which is an agent and that is actually
- [07:35] something that we're going to need to
- [07:36] import from paidantic AI.
- [07:43] going to import the agent and then the
- [07:46] agent is going to use the open AI GPT
- [07:52] 40 model.
- [07:57] We're going to need to supply the
- [07:59] dependencies which is triage
- [08:01] dependencies. We're going to need to
- [08:03] specify the output type which is triage
- [08:06] output and we're going to supply
- [08:12] a system prompt.
- [08:17] You are a triage assistant helping
- [08:22] patients.
- [08:25] I still can't type
- [08:28] there.
- [08:30] provide
- [08:32] clear advice and assess urgency. There
- [08:37] we go. That's our system prompts.
- [08:40] I'm missing closing parenthesis. Oh
- [08:44] yeah. Wow. Copilot even corrects my
- [08:47] spelling. Very helpful. Okay. So, this
- [08:49] is my agent. And now what you can do,
- [08:52] let's change this main function here, is
- [08:56] we can create the dependencies. So,
- [08:58] we're going to do that for patient 42.
- [09:01] And we have a database connection. And
- [09:04] then we're going to get a result
- [09:08] from the triage agent.
- [09:13] And we can then specify a prompt supply
- [09:18] dependencies. There we go.
- [09:21] And then we can print the result.put.
- [09:27] Something went wrong here with the
- [09:28] parenthesis. I know if you also have
- [09:30] that problem if you have these kind of
- [09:32] editing AI kind of tools that they
- [09:35] always screw up my parenthesis for some
- [09:37] reason. Not sure why that happens. Okay,
- [09:39] so now we're actually running the agent.
- [09:42] And let's see what happens if we run the
- [09:45] file again. So now you see we get back
- [09:48] an object with a response text. We have
- [09:51] escalate is false, urgency is two, which
- [09:54] is probably right in this particular
- [09:57] case. Seems like it's not very urgent,
- [10:00] right? But the thing is, of course,
- [10:02] that's it's not really using any of the
- [10:05] patient information. Right? Now, before
- [10:07] I show you how to make this more patient
- [10:09] dependent, if you're enjoying this
- [10:10] video, give it a like and subscribe to
- [10:13] the channel. This is a small thing, but
- [10:15] really helps and lets me keep making
- [10:17] these types of videos. Now let's say we
- [10:19] want to personalize this more to the
- [10:22] patient instead of this very generic uh
- [10:25] thing that we get here as a response. So
- [10:28] what you can do then with the pyantic AI
- [10:31] agents is you can add things like for
- [10:34] example you can add a system prompt
- [10:37] triage agent dot system prompt. So I'm
- [10:41] going to use
- [10:44] the system prompt decorator
- [10:49] and then we're going to add the patient
- [10:52] name and prompts in pantic AI they're
- [10:54] going to get a context. So in this case
- [10:56] that is a run context which well we need
- [11:00] to import that from a pyantic AI
- [11:05] like so. And run context is a generic
- [11:08] type
- [11:10] that gets dependencies like so.
- [11:15] And this is going to return a name
- [11:16] because we want the patient name of
- [11:18] course.
- [11:20] So then we get the patient name from the
- [11:23] database providing the patient ID and
- [11:26] then we can do is simply write the
- [11:28] patient name.
- [11:33] Patient name is like so. Now this is
- [11:36] going to add this particular system
- [11:38] prompt to our agent which is nice. And
- [11:42] then what we can do in the agent for
- [11:43] example is to also indicate always
- [11:47] mention
- [11:48] the patient name when available like so.
- [11:51] So it's more personalized. So we're
- [11:53] going to get generic advice but at least
- [11:55] it's going to be uh personalized to you.
- [11:58] So when I run this let's see what the
- [12:00] response text is.
- [12:03] There you go. John for your symptoms etc
- [12:06] etc. So now it's personalized to the
- [12:08] patient name because it uses the uh
- [12:11] system prompt and adds it to my agent.
- [12:14] So that's a really helpful tool. You can
- [12:15] of course add more of these prompts if
- [12:17] that's helpful and get uh useful
- [12:20] information from the dependencies. Now
- [12:22] instead of just getting data, you can
- [12:24] also add tools. For example, calling a
- [12:26] function that does something. So in this
- [12:29] case, I'm going to keep it really simple
- [12:32] and I'm just going to add a tool to get
- [12:35] the latest vitals for a patient. Now
- [12:37] this is simply a database request, but
- [12:39] you can also imagine that the tool is
- [12:41] actually I don't know augmenting some
- [12:43] patient information in a database or or
- [12:46] do basically whatever you want. But here
- [12:48] I'm just going to get the latest vitals.
- [12:51] So now when I run this again,
- [12:54] it's going to take the latest vitals
- [12:56] into account when creating the response.
- [13:00] So as you can see, it now mentions the
- [13:02] vital signs and the blood pressure.
- [13:06] And if I change these things, so in this
- [13:08] case, we're talking about John. Let's
- [13:10] say I'm going to give John a heart rate
- [13:13] of 30. It's not very high. and also like
- [13:17] a very low blood pressure like so not
- [13:22] sure if this is even realistic but just
- [13:24] to see how it influences the result. So
- [13:26] now you see that whereas in the previous
- [13:28] responses we got uh escalate is false
- [13:32] right we got that here and we got a
- [13:34] pretty low urgency now even though the
- [13:37] patient is saying the same thing it uses
- [13:39] the information to actually change these
- [13:41] values so now escalate is true so a
- [13:44] nurse should take a look at this and the
- [13:46] urgency is also higher so what's really
- [13:48] cool about this is that you can combine
- [13:50] LM reasoning with your domain knowledge
- [13:54] the outputs you get are validated by
- [13:58] Pyantic and they're structured so you
- [14:00] can trust them and use them in other
- [14:01] parts of your application. You can
- [14:03] extend this agent by adding more tools
- [14:05] or prompts or anything you like. And in
- [14:08] my opinion, this is a big step in
- [14:09] incorporating AI in your Python
- [14:11] applications in a more useful way. Now,
- [14:14] predentic AI's other possibilities as
- [14:16] well. on particular graphs are kind of
- [14:18] interesting. Although they say in the
- [14:21] documentation themselves that well don't
- [14:23] use it if you don't really need it
- [14:24] because of course graphs can potentially
- [14:27] complicate things. But they do mention
- [14:29] different ways of organizing your agent
- [14:32] workflows. So the one that I showed you
- [14:34] today was a single agent workflow.
- [14:36] That's also what most of the
- [14:38] documentation shows. But you can also
- [14:41] combine agents. For example, you could
- [14:42] have one agent that then defines a tool
- [14:46] that uses another agent. You can have an
- [14:49] agent run something and then the
- [14:51] application code could do something with
- [14:54] the data or call another agent. Or you
- [14:56] could go full on graph uh based control
- [15:00] and then you can define these graphs
- [15:02] with nodes and edges and make like a
- [15:04] really complicated setup. But only do
- [15:07] that if it actually uh adds something to
- [15:09] your application. If you can use one of
- [15:11] the simpler methods I mentioned just
- [15:13] now, I think that overall is better. But
- [15:16] I'd like to know what you think. Do you
- [15:18] use pideantic AI? Could you see yourself
- [15:20] using it in your own projects? Maybe in
- [15:23] finance, healthcare, or something
- [15:25] completely different. Let me know in the
- [15:27] comments. Now, there are, of course,
- [15:29] next to Pyantic AI a bunch of other
- [15:32] libraries that are incredibly helpful to
- [15:34] building stuff in Python. You probably
- [15:36] already know quite a few of them like
- [15:37] pandas or fast API. Now, if you want to
- [15:40] learn about more libraries that are
- [15:41] really helpful, but only few developers
- [15:44] know about, check out this video next.
