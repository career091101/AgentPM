- [00:06] Nice moves.
- [00:07] >> Oh, thank you. Um,
- [00:11] yeah. So, this was I think when we
- [00:16] started talking about this panel, I
- [00:18] didn't even realize how much work you've
- [00:21] been doing on the Agentic Cloud. I think
- [00:23] it's sort of if it works, nothing
- [00:25] breaks. You don't hear about it. Um, but
- [00:28] so I guess let's start with that. You
- [00:32] were talking about the building blocks.
- [00:34] I think if people aren't building
- [00:37] >> cloud-based agents, they may not know
- [00:39] about everything that's out there to
- [00:41] build on. So, so what are the building
- [00:43] blocks that people in the audience could
- [00:45] use right now?
- [00:46] >> Sure. Sure. So, there's two paths. If
- [00:48] you want to go code first and uh you
- [00:51] know you want to really get into the
- [00:53] nuts and bolts of building um agents uh
- [00:56] you can take a path through like agent
- [00:57] development kit and more fine grain
- [01:00] control. This will give you like the
- [01:02] observability, the debugging, the u you
- [01:04] know tool management, tool creation, you
- [01:07] know, kind of all of those things uh
- [01:09] bound together in a nice little package
- [01:11] to help you get started if you're you're
- [01:12] really after like refining and building
- [01:16] agents themselves for the sake of
- [01:18] getting value from those uh first coded
- [01:20] agents. If you're more of like I want to
- [01:21] build an app and the agent flow is like
- [01:23] how I want to build an app, then we have
- [01:25] a completely you know separate track
- [01:28] which is Gemini Enterprise. And with
- [01:30] Gemini Enterprise, you can basically
- [01:31] just go into UI and you're like, "Hey, I
- [01:34] want to uh look ahead my calendar this
- [01:36] week and I want to prep for any
- [01:38] meeting." This is obviously one that I
- [01:40] use all the time [laughter] and I want
- [01:41] to prep for any meetings that I have.
- [01:43] And because it has connectors to your
- [01:45] calendar, you know, built in because it
- [01:47] has connectors to thirdparty data
- [01:48] sources already built in like your CRM,
- [01:50] you don't have to fuss with all like the
- [01:52] data engineering and the data
- [01:53] management. You can just define an
- [01:55] objective for your agent. You have got
- [01:56] the connectors built in. the agent now
- [01:58] has context. It'll run ahead. It'll look
- [02:01] at your calendar and it will uh and it
- [02:03] it will actually propose like, hey,
- [02:05] based on who you're meeting with and the
- [02:06] nature of those meetings. Here's some
- [02:08] ideas also for research. Uh here's some
- [02:11] ideas for background that uh may be
- [02:13] helpful to you in those meetings. So, uh
- [02:16] really depends, you know, what you're
- [02:17] building. You know, code first and agent
- [02:20] kind of optimization ADK uh and you and
- [02:23] that takes you down a path of also
- [02:25] orchestrating multiple agents. And we'll
- [02:26] get into I think probably agent, you
- [02:28] know, commerce as well. If you're trying
- [02:30] to build apps, you know, go to Gemini
- [02:32] Enterprise and take the easy button.
- [02:34] >> Yeah. Well, so this is commerce. I'm
- [02:36] going to I'm going to pick that right
- [02:38] up.
- [02:39] I got really interested in this because
- [02:42] in the last few months you've rolled out
- [02:45] this new payments protocol that
- [02:47] basically is allowing agents to maybe
- [02:51] just put things in your cart for you to
- [02:53] buy or maybe actually buy things for
- [02:56] you. Really handing over the credit card
- [02:58] to the to the intern so to speak. I
- [03:01] guess h how do you build up to that?
- [03:03] >> Yeah. So it really uh depends on your
- [03:05] use case but there are there are kind of
- [03:07] two main um paths for using this agent
- [03:10] payments protocol and again you know
- [03:11] we'll we'll think about this in like
- [03:12] terms of a stack. So first we had to you
- [03:14] know get agents up and running and give
- [03:16] you the tools get agents up and running
- [03:17] quickly. So that's the ADK. Then on top
- [03:20] of that you know a lot of these
- [03:22] workflows are going to be multiple
- [03:23] agents. So we have the agentto agent
- [03:24] protocol. And then like once you're
- [03:26] transacting and you're interacting
- [03:28] across multiple agents you want to
- [03:29] exchange value. And so that's the agent
- [03:31] payment protocol. And there are kind of
- [03:32] two main use cases. One is I'm going to
- [03:35] give you some parameters and I want you
- [03:38] to go and like if if you're a sneaker
- [03:40] head, you know, and you always miss out
- [03:42] because the bots are getting you, you
- [03:43] know, because they're getting to the
- [03:44] sneaker sales before you're able to get
- [03:46] to the sneaker sales, you can define an
- [03:48] agent that says, you know, I I want this
- [03:50] type of sneaker and kind of these cost
- [03:52] parameters, these features, and when
- [03:54] it's available, I want you to let me
- [03:56] know. And that's what we call a mandate.
- [03:57] you give this agent a mandate and it'll
- [03:59] go out and it'll be uh monitoring the
- [04:01] web and once that condition those
- [04:03] guardrails are met it'll come and prompt
- [04:05] you and then you have the choice to go
- [04:07] and put something in the card and to
- [04:08] finish the transaction. There's another
- [04:10] one which is you know what uh I trust
- [04:14] the agent to go and kind of curate all
- [04:16] these things to put it in the cart and
- [04:18] all I really want to do is finish the
- [04:19] transaction and so this has kind of two
- [04:22] levels of mandate there's like this
- [04:23] initial you know set of guardrails and
- [04:25] then there's a trust mandate and uh
- [04:27] think of like travel you know going you
- [04:30] want to go somewhere you want to have uh
- [04:31] you know a bunch of options put together
- [04:33] for uh airfare hotel experiences you're
- [04:37] going to need multiple agents going out
- [04:38] bringing those things back putting them
- [04:40] into the cart and saying like, "Okay,
- [04:41] it's time to check out." And then the
- [04:43] human can just check out. One really
- [04:45] important thing about this um as a
- [04:47] technologist is that because we're in
- [04:49] the early days of agents, um agent
- [04:53] payment protocol is is like a whisper of
- [04:55] the future, which is how do you automate
- [04:57] the exchange of value? And this is
- [04:59] relevant to, you know, if you're uh a
- [05:02] startup and you're trying to advertise
- [05:03] your inventory, you know, the future is
- [05:06] you're going to be advertising inventory
- [05:07] to a bunch of agents and you want to get
- [05:09] those transactions done in as much an
- [05:11] automated fashion as quickly as
- [05:13] possible. And actually like human
- [05:14] slowness and human weirdness about, you
- [05:16] know, like they'll go and scan your
- [05:18] website, they'll look at your inventory,
- [05:19] they'll leave it, they'll abandon the
- [05:20] cart, they'll do all this stuff. You
- [05:22] know, in a way, we're also building, you
- [05:24] know, one this kind of new commerce of
- [05:25] the future and more of a consumer
- [05:27] version, but also in a B2B scenario, you
- [05:30] can imagine if you're like a large
- [05:31] shipping company and you get millions of
- [05:33] invoices every day, you want to be able
- [05:35] to complete those transactions in the
- [05:36] background, you know, receive invoices,
- [05:38] pay valid invoices, flag ones that might
- [05:40] be, you know, a little bit out of band,
- [05:43] um, and do that in a highly scaled and
- [05:44] automated fashion. So, you know, expect
- [05:46] to see more of these multi-agent
- [05:48] automated, you know, real-time
- [05:50] fulfillment, but we had, you know, you
- [05:52] had to start somewhere. So, you have to
- [05:53] start with the foundations just like the
- [05:54] web, you have to start with the
- [05:55] protocols and the rules of engagement
- [05:57] for how you uh transact.
- [05:59] >> Yeah. So, I'm glad you, you know, I
- [06:02] think this idea of the transition to a
- [06:05] commerce is so interesting and so kind
- [06:09] of fraught. I want to pick on one thing
- [06:10] you said. You were sort of saying, "Oh,
- [06:12] okay. If you're a sneaker head and those
- [06:14] terrible bots keep snapping up the early
- [06:17] sneakers,
- [06:18] but like what you've built here is a bot
- [06:21] for buying sneakers. [laughter]
- [06:22] >> Yes. Yes. But it is a precision bot that
- [06:24] you control and now you are on a level
- [06:27] playing field with these aggregators
- [06:30] that would go and take all this
- [06:31] inventory and then they'd resell it and
- [06:33] they jack the prices up. So in a way
- [06:36] we're also you know fine-tuning these
- [06:38] agent flows so that you can get more
- [06:40] value out of you know a workflow and as
- [06:43] an individual consumer or as a business
- [06:45] maybe you don't have to pay those
- [06:46] intermediaries anymore. Maybe now you
- [06:48] can operate with like the power that
- [06:50] only you know these kind of these
- [06:52] aggregators had in the past.
- [06:53] >> Yeah. I just I I think it kind of gets
- [06:55] to the social complexity of it where as
- [06:58] as we're in this world where maybe some
- [07:00] people are using agents to buy things
- [07:02] and other people are buying things on
- [07:03] the internet. Maybe some people are
- [07:05] still buying things in stores. Like how
- [07:08] do you think about the perspective of
- [07:12] the store where they say, you know, are
- [07:14] they going to be glad when the agentic
- [07:16] buyers show up
- [07:17] >> eventually? Uh
- [07:18] >> eventually. Yeah.
- [07:19] >> And the reason I say that is because uh
- [07:21] if how you know how many of us have been
- [07:24] designing against like robots.ext text
- [07:26] and like these you know automated bots
- [07:28] that come into your uh website or into
- [07:31] your business. Uh and in the past we
- [07:33] might call these malware or we might
- [07:35] call these you know cyber security
- [07:37] incidents. So if you're the CISO or if
- [07:39] you're the head of security for any
- [07:40] organization of a reasonable size right
- [07:42] now you have really had to flip your
- [07:43] thinking from you know the the bots are
- [07:46] bad to the bots are your customer. So
- [07:49] that's why I say eventually because you
- [07:51] know there right now and it's kind of
- [07:52] like this AI play counterplay. So now
- [07:55] the CISOs and there's a huge opportunity
- [07:58] in cyber security where if you can build
- [08:00] tools that can reason and and
- [08:02] rationalize this kind of inbound swarm
- [08:05] or flood of agents into your
- [08:06] organization into your website into your
- [08:08] uh commerce platforms then you're going
- [08:11] to be able to take advantage of this
- [08:12] kind of early mover. And if you aren't
- [08:14] designing AI systems to kind of reason
- [08:17] about these new behaviors, uh, then
- [08:19] you're going to get left behind. And as
- [08:20] a again, you know, as a technologist,
- [08:22] one of the things I always think about
- [08:23] is how do I get learning loops as
- [08:25] quickly as possible. And so a lot of the
- [08:27] leading edge companies right now,
- [08:28] they're, you know, they're creating
- [08:30] perimeters or they're creating kind of
- [08:31] sandboxes. They're creating ways that
- [08:33] they can characterize the flood of these
- [08:35] agents coming in and they can learn how
- [08:37] to instrument against it faster. So it's
- [08:39] kind of like you have to let them in a
- [08:40] little bit so you can get the learning
- [08:41] curve. Um but a lot of that's being
- [08:44] designed right now.
- [08:45] >> Yeah. Yeah. So one of the alternate
- [08:47] visions of this the other you know major
- [08:50] uh agentic commerce idea is of course
- [08:53] OpenAI's instant checkout where we're
- [08:55] seeing these
- [08:57] sort of company by company launching
- [08:59] with Stripe. Okay. Now we're partnering
- [09:01] with PayPal so PayPal can do it too.
- [09:03] It's not the open protocol approach, but
- [09:07] we're kind of back in the classic
- [09:09] technologist struggle of okay, do we
- [09:12] want the walled garden? Do we want the
- [09:13] open protocol? I guess h how do you
- [09:15] think about the consequences of that?
- [09:17] >> Uh I bet on open. I mean, if you look at
- [09:21] uh the foundations of the web, if you
- [09:23] look at the foundations of commerce
- [09:24] today, underneath all of them are
- [09:26] standards and protocols that were built
- [09:28] in communities. And that goes from you
- [09:30] know how packets transit a network to
- [09:32] how you trust that a site is exactly the
- [09:34] site that it should be um to authorities
- [09:37] around security uh starting with open is
- [09:40] absolutely critical and that's act and
- [09:42] that's why like in ADK that I mentioned
- [09:44] earlier you can bring models other than
- [09:46] Gemini you know into ADK and build
- [09:48] agents using other people's models. uh
- [09:51] this has been an approach that we have
- [09:52] taken and you know I've been at Google
- [09:53] cloud now for 11 or 12 years and you
- [09:57] know since the very beginning it was
- [09:59] kubernetes it was tensorflow it was open
- [10:01] standards it's how do we give you as
- [10:04] builders an option where if you want to
- [10:06] compose and manage yourself you know you
- [10:08] have these open versions and you have
- [10:09] lots of choice if you want to take
- [10:11] advantage of some of the managed bits
- [10:13] you know we can do that for you as well
- [10:15] and so uh right now like scaled use of
- [10:18] AI infrastructure it turns out that uh
- [10:21] customers and businesses and builders
- [10:23] don't want to pay reseller fees to get
- [10:26] AI models and AI uh infrastructure these
- [10:29] days. So they like coming to a place
- [10:30] like Google Cloud where we have our own
- [10:32] firstparty models, we have our own
- [10:34] firstparty AI infrastructure and we're
- [10:35] not just reselling somebody else's
- [10:37] stuff. And we also learn how to optimize
- [10:40] because that's true because we have
- [10:41] these things. Uh we learn to optimize.
- [10:43] So if you want scaled AI infrastructure,
- [10:44] we can give you managed scaled tensor
- [10:47] processing units through Google
- [10:48] Kubernetes Engine GKE in a managed way.
- [10:51] Or if you want to roll your own like
- [10:53] abstractions and you want to manage them
- [10:54] yourself, you know, like uh Anthropic
- [10:57] and others, customers have been learning
- [10:58] how to build and go from GPUs to TPUs
- [11:02] along the way, too.
- [11:03] >> Yeah. Please be careful rolling your own
- [11:05] abstractions, though. That's
- [11:08] >> Yeah, I would agree with that. You're in
- [11:09] for a p in for a pound, [laughter] I
- [11:11] guess, is uh is way to think about it.
- [11:13] >> So, I mean, we're describing a kind of
- [11:16] world of agent commerce that is not
- [11:18] really here yet, but I guess how do you
- [11:21] how fast do you see this coming down the
- [11:23] road?
- [11:26] Well, I mean, I work with a lot of uh
- [11:28] startups, a lot of uh enterprises, and I
- [11:31] can tell you that the first iterations
- [11:33] of these agentic workflows, generally
- [11:35] speaking, it's kind of small uhish like
- [11:38] numbers of agents. So, I would say like,
- [11:40] you know, the swarms of hundreds or
- [11:42] thousands aren't here yet, but in the
- [11:43] tens to, you know, getting to hundreds,
- [11:45] the orchestration of them is a really uh
- [11:47] important thing to think about. Um
- [11:50] but there are quite a few deployments of
- [11:54] um AI agents right now. One for example
- [11:56] uh Sully AI which is a startup that
- [11:59] provides um in healthcare basically like
- [12:02] healthcare task automation agents as
- [12:04] like a service to healthcare workers. So
- [12:06] like there are a lot of administrative
- [12:07] tasks you take care of every single day
- [12:09] in healthcare and Sully AI has basically
- [12:11] created agents that allow them you know
- [12:13] using Google cloud that allow healthcare
- [12:15] workers to take a lot of that
- [12:16] administrative burden and minimize it so
- [12:18] they can focus on patient care. Um so
- [12:21] they are out in the real world and they
- [12:22] are you know creating value today. I
- [12:24] think it's more of the multi- aent
- [12:26] interactions, you know, complex
- [12:28] multi-agent orchestration that is the
- [12:29] frontier.
- [12:30] >> And so, do we think when are we going to
- [12:33] start to see that? I mean, is that like
- [12:35] >> five years out? Is it five months out?
- [12:38] >> You're ask you're asking a technologist
- [12:40] and a CTO to give a roadmap timeline
- [12:43] with assurityity in front of a large
- [12:44] crowd. So,
- [12:45] >> yeah, [laughter]
- [12:46] >> it's not my first rodeo, Russell. Um,
- [12:50] >> fair. But what I will say is I think you
- [12:51] can bet on like waves of innovation. So
- [12:54] the the first wave which is just b um
- [12:57] building singular task agents to
- [12:59] accomplish singular function is here now
- [13:00] and it's growing rapidly. So you could
- [13:03] also kind of this is semi close to RPA
- [13:05] and kind of the first you know
- [13:06] iterations of uh you know automation but
- [13:09] we're rapidly getting to uh multi- aent
- [13:13] uh orchestrated workflows within I'd say
- [13:15] like one use case. So for example,
- [13:17] marketing uh generating uh creative
- [13:20] right now you can uh use you know Gemini
- [13:24] as a front end and you can say hey I I
- [13:26] really have an idea for this interesting
- [13:28] creative thing and using you know
- [13:30] imagine under the hood or nano banana
- [13:31] under the hood it'll give you a first
- [13:34] order like this is what it could look
- [13:35] like and then you can send it to VO and
- [13:38] it can uh turn it into a short form
- [13:40] video but then you have other things
- [13:41] that you need like brand guidelines and
- [13:43] you need you know AI as a judge to say
- [13:45] like Is this content even something I
- [13:47] would put out to my users? And so in
- [13:50] those workflows, a lot of the
- [13:51] innovations happening right now is like
- [13:52] the AI being capable of evaluating the
- [13:55] outputs. So that um uh in my team we
- [13:58] talk about like if you're a manager now,
- [14:00] if if you're in the in the flow of of
- [14:03] any work, basically AI has made your
- [14:06] life a nightmare because uh it's
- [14:08] stacking up all of these things that
- [14:10] need validation or evaluation. And as a
- [14:13] human, you know, I think of it like
- [14:14] folders on a desk. That's how old I am.
- [14:16] So, you know, when you were a manager
- [14:17] back in the day, it's like you have a
- [14:18] desk and people bring you their stuff
- [14:19] and it's in a folder and you have to
- [14:21] like approve it. And in and in, you
- [14:23] know, the old days, you know, it was
- [14:24] gated by what humans could put on your
- [14:26] desk, how fast they could get the work
- [14:28] done. So, it's like, okay, cool. Like
- [14:29] every single day, I get like 20 to 100
- [14:30] folders. I burn down through as many as
- [14:32] I can. By the end of the week, as long
- [14:33] as it's down to zero folders or a low
- [14:34] number, it's great. Problem is now is
- [14:36] that AI can create like infinite folders
- [14:39] almost instantly. So one of the big
- [14:42] unlocks for the you know in the shorter
- [14:44] run is going to be AI as a judge AI
- [14:46] evals grounding in like brand guidelines
- [14:49] or grounding in enterprise data that
- [14:52] allows the outputs of these things to be
- [14:55] contextual to be useful and to be things
- [14:57] that companies are proud of and can
- [14:58] actually use. Um whereas like I think
- [15:00] these big agent swarms I think there's a
- [15:02] lot of fragility right now in for
- [15:03] example um like in financial services
- [15:06] say you want to build uh I want to build
- [15:09] the the um like financial adviser bot
- [15:12] well there's no financial adviser bot
- [15:14] because financial advising is a series
- [15:15] of tasks there's like 10 to 14 tasks are
- [15:18] involved in that and trying to get 10 or
- [15:20] 14 agents to reconcile their
- [15:23] perspectives and synthesize that into
- [15:25] like one output that can be delivered to
- [15:26] a human today is a very complex process.
- [15:29] and is very much on the frontier and I
- [15:31] would say there's still room to go.
- [15:33] >> Okay. Yeah. This idea of like stacking
- [15:37] [laughter] folders is so visceral but
- [15:39] it's also I mean right now we're still
- [15:41] trying to evaluate I mean AI evals I
- [15:46] when I hear it I think oh you're talking
- [15:47] about benchmarking and humans evaluating
- [15:49] AI and it's like no we need AI systems
- [15:52] that can evaluate AI outputs absolutely
- [15:55] and start clearing the folders out. we
- [15:57] need to move at the same p. The thing is
- [15:59] that like human cognition and human, you
- [16:02] know, like uh evaluation runs at human
- [16:05] speed, but like AI can generate content
- [16:08] way faster than humans are able to go
- [16:10] like that's good, that's bad. And so you
- [16:12] have to that is like one of the key
- [16:14] problems to solve in almost any workflow
- [16:16] is how fast the decisions how fast the
- [16:18] content how fast the analysis the
- [16:21] synthesis the reports depending on which
- [16:23] use case you're in how fast you can get
- [16:25] AI to kind of sort through take out the
- [16:28] stuff that's obviously bad uh and really
- [16:31] queue up the human for the highest value
- [16:33] like Eval's most complex edge cases uh
- [16:36] you know that's super critical.
- [16:38] >> Yeah. So that gets to this question that
- [16:41] I think keeps coming up when we talk
- [16:43] about these obviously AI agents are
- [16:46] making huge technical progress.
- [16:49] I wonder if sort of are they there yet?
- [16:52] Is is the missing piece really kind of
- [16:55] more capabilities from the underlying
- [16:57] agentic tech itself?
- [16:58] >> I think it's um it's multiple things. So
- [17:00] for example uh you know Gemini today you
- [17:04] know leading frontier model it's been
- [17:06] that way for you know kind of six months
- [17:08] plus which in this world feels like an
- [17:10] eternity and that has to continue. So we
- [17:14] definitely need innovation we need more
- [17:16] like reasoning capabilities we need more
- [17:20] um kind of navigating and and kind of
- [17:22] like ambient capabilities inside the
- [17:24] front end or like a frontier model like
- [17:26] Gemini. So you need that but you also
- [17:28] need grounding tools. uh you need the
- [17:30] ability to bring in enterprise data more
- [17:32] easily. You know, some of this is going
- [17:33] to be through connectors and you know
- [17:35] creating tools and kind of like the old
- [17:37] school publish and subscribe. If
- [17:38] anybody's been around for a while like I
- [17:40] have, you know, this is concept of like
- [17:41] publish and subscribe where you have
- [17:43] data sources and they publish their
- [17:44] availability and then you have consumers
- [17:46] that subscribe to topics. We're back
- [17:48] again. You know, we just use different
- [17:50] words. And so now, you know, there's
- [17:52] also a need for companies and
- [17:54] organizations if they haven't
- [17:55] externalized their data through an API
- [17:58] or through a tool, you know, they're at
- [18:00] risk of like getting left behind or
- [18:03] becoming irrelevant in a world like
- [18:04] this. So, you need the, you know, you
- [18:06] need the connectors, you need the tools
- [18:08] created, you need this kind of rich
- [18:10] ecosystem of data sources available and
- [18:12] APIs, you need API management, you know,
- [18:14] you need a way to sort through and
- [18:16] navigate against all of these different
- [18:18] um options. So, and that's just like
- [18:20] three layers of the stack. If we had,
- [18:22] you know, another like three days, we
- [18:24] could go through kind of all the layers
- [18:26] of it because there's also a lot of
- [18:27] bindings in between that make these
- [18:30] workflows useful like in the real world.
- [18:32] But you have to you can't just choose
- [18:33] one area like as as Google Cloud like we
- [18:35] can't just choose one area to innovate.
- [18:37] We have to provide and that's why we do
- [18:40] a complete end-to-end AI stack that is
- [18:43] both first party but also has uh you
- [18:46] know is built kind of with open in mind.
- [18:48] So, you know, we have model garden, we
- [18:50] have, you know, agent gardens, we have
- [18:52] these places where if what we have isn't
- [18:54] at that point in time exactly what you
- [18:55] need, you can go get it from somebody
- [18:56] else. Those are the table stakes to be,
- [18:59] you know, on the frontier of technology
- [19:01] today.
- [19:02] >> Yeah. Well, so I want to ask about one
- [19:04] specific layer that I think gets
- [19:06] overlooked a lot, but these are
- [19:09] incredibly powerful tools. Not everyone
- [19:11] on the internet is as nice and friendly
- [19:13] as we are. I guess I hear about, you
- [19:17] know, generating these endless folders,
- [19:19] doing all of this work at scale,
- [19:21] particularly once payments are in the
- [19:22] mix. Yeah. And I worry about the
- [19:25] security aspect of do do we need better
- [19:29] tools for identifying bad actors, for
- [19:32] validating agents so that we can sort of
- [19:36] smoke out bad activity?
- [19:38] >> Yeah. Well, the answer to that is is
- [19:40] absolutely yes. Um and we're just at the
- [19:44] beginning of this. So you know within um
- [19:46] like Google cloud one of the things that
- [19:48] we focus a lot on is uh governance
- [19:51] security um trust and quite often trust
- [19:55] you know it's interesting because in the
- [19:56] generative AI world you know trust has
- [19:59] this kind of new layer of do I it's not
- [20:00] deterministic you know and so it's like
- [20:02] do I really trust the outputs and how do
- [20:04] I create systems of trust and I find
- [20:06] that's as much a barrier or something to
- [20:08] solve as you know like classic
- [20:11] identifying potential you know malware
- [20:14] um you injection threats. Um, so there's
- [20:17] like a there's a track where the
- [20:18] fundamental technology will continue to
- [20:20] become, you know, more secure, but then
- [20:22] there's like this trust tier where, you
- [20:25] know, it's really about making sure that
- [20:27] the AI is doing what it's supposed to be
- [20:28] doing. So, you know, observability,
- [20:30] telemetry, eval
- [20:33] um, and you know, believe it or not, not
- [20:35] every company has exactly the same
- [20:36] sensibilities about how much risk
- [20:38] they're willing to take. [laughter]
- [20:39] >> I've heard that. Yeah. So, you know,
- [20:42] there's also like configurations of this
- [20:44] and one of the things we learned very
- [20:46] early on, you know, uh you could say
- [20:48] we've been very deliberate about um you
- [20:51] know, safety and responsibility. One of
- [20:53] the things that we discovered very early
- [20:54] on is uh some companies would take our
- [20:56] filtering and our settings uh you know
- [20:58] of kind of like do you want it to be
- [21:00] creative or do you want it to be you
- [21:02] know definitive or or you know
- [21:04] authoritative and so many people would
- [21:06] actually set it to creative
- [21:08] um way more than we thought. And so, you
- [21:10] know, for us, it's about surfacing a
- [21:12] platform that you can configure your own
- [21:14] filters and add your own governance to
- [21:16] whatever like your brand, you know, how
- [21:18] you want to take on risk. And that's way
- [21:20] more important than us coming up with
- [21:21] some singular vision of like how do you
- [21:23] do risk management and we operate in so
- [21:25] many constituencies in in in Europe,
- [21:28] AMIA, JPAC in um the Americas and there
- [21:31] are subtle differences in all of those.
- [21:33] So we also have we're building you know
- [21:35] aenta capabilities being able to deploy
- [21:38] in um you know infrastructure that's
- [21:41] connected or sometimes disconnected. You
- [21:43] know one of the projects that my team is
- [21:45] working on right now in the CTO group is
- [21:47] how do you give signals of intent of
- [21:49] what of what's happening but it can
- [21:51] cross trust boundaries that are actually
- [21:53] airgapped physically separated because
- [21:55] you can't share the data itself and
- [21:57] obviously like AI hasn't figured out a
- [21:58] way to like come out of the machine walk
- [22:00] over and like walk into the other
- [22:01] machine and figure you know
- [22:02] >> not yet. Yeah.
- [22:02] >> Yeah. not yet. [laughter] Um, but there
- [22:05] are ways there are emerging techniques
- [22:07] to understand the intent of a workflow
- [22:09] or kind of early telemetry and then ways
- [22:12] to like bridge the gap. Uh, and so
- [22:14] that's also really really exciting in
- [22:16] terms of security is being able to bring
- [22:18] more AI and more capabilities of agents
- [22:21] to scenarios that typically would have
- [22:22] been closed off to AI, which is smaller
- [22:24] compute shapes, uh, you know, uh,
- [22:26] disconnected infrastructure. Uh, that's
- [22:29] really a frontier that I'm excited
- [22:30] about.
- [22:31] >> Yeah. So we're sort of talking about
- [22:34] this complex agentic world. Obviously
- [22:38] that's going to involve consuming a lot
- [22:39] of cloud services I think is a safe
- [22:42] assumption.
- [22:42] >> That'd be great. [laughter]
- [22:44] >> But we also don't know how fast it's
- [22:46] coming, how soon it's getting here, how
- [22:48] quickly we're going to solve all of
- [22:50] these problems that that you know you
- [22:52] identify that we're actively working on.
- [22:54] At the same time, we're in the middle of
- [22:57] this unprecedented infrastructure
- [22:59] buildout. You know, I have Meta has said
- [23:02] they're going to spend 600 billion
- [23:03] dollars, you know, in the next few
- [23:05] years. We're getting 500 billion from
- [23:06] Stargate.
- [23:08] There are all of these sort of
- [23:10] uncertainties about how fast all of the
- [23:14] stuff we're describing will get built. I
- [23:16] guess do you worry that we're
- [23:18] overbuilding as a kind of society and
- [23:22] that there's going to be some harsh
- [23:24] correction that that gets in the middle
- [23:26] of this? I mean to be able to answer
- [23:28] that as you know as like society build I
- [23:30] would have to have a lot more data on
- [23:32] the de on the demand side from other
- [23:35] firms. I'd have to I'd have to see
- [23:36] demand signals from other firms to know
- [23:38] um I can at least tell you from the
- [23:40] Google perspective uh one I think AI has
- [23:44] definitely redefined uh and kind of
- [23:47] restarted the cloud market itself and
- [23:48] and infrastructure being a large part of
- [23:50] that. So we're in an entirely new game
- [23:52] today when it comes to cloud and
- [23:53] infrastructure. Um you know second thing
- [23:57] that is important about the scaled
- [23:59] infrastructure moment is that uh
- [24:02] there is so much demand. There is so
- [24:04] much demand Russell um and I think part
- [24:08] of that is that uh we're in a place now
- [24:11] where the um the kind of the frontiers
- [24:14] are being built and so you have multiple
- [24:16] frontier model providers. Um and as we
- [24:19] transition into inference, there's also
- [24:22] a recognition, you know, that we need to
- [24:24] make sure that compute is uh readily
- [24:26] available for inference. And so we're
- [24:28] kind of building we're kind of building
- [24:29] across segments right now. So like
- [24:31] there's a segment of like the large AI
- [24:32] labs and they need uh you know
- [24:34] availability to massive amounts of
- [24:35] infrastructure uh for training and to
- [24:38] and this continuous innovation
- [24:39] development. But there's also another
- [24:41] track which is as more of these become
- [24:43] real um inference becomes more and more
- [24:46] important and that's that's been a big
- [24:47] driver at least for us on you know our
- [24:50] tensor processing units and going from
- [24:52] really a training mindset in the past in
- [24:55] the architecture to now uh with Ironwood
- [24:57] which I'm happy to report is in the
- [24:59] hands of our first set of trusted
- [25:01] testers through GKE um you know Ironwood
- [25:05] is was built for a world where yes
- [25:07] training is going to be there but
- [25:08] inference is going to start to take, you
- [25:10] know, the preponderance of of workloads
- [25:12] over time and uh so, you know, 10x
- [25:15] performance improvement year-over-year,
- [25:17] TW uh 2x improvement in um efficiency,
- [25:20] power efficiency year-over-year. So,
- [25:22] those are the things that we're
- [25:23] interested in is, you know, we've done
- [25:25] infrastructure at scale a bit at Google.
- [25:28] And one of the things that we know is
- [25:30] that to, you know, build correctly and
- [25:32] build the right way is um constantly
- [25:36] looking for optimizations. So it may
- [25:38] gather a lot of headlines about, you
- [25:40] know, all the all the, you know, money
- [25:41] that's being spent and all the
- [25:42] infrastructure that's being proposed by
- [25:44] a bunch of these players, but underneath
- [25:45] the hood, we're busy making sure that
- [25:47] our TPUs, you know, we we have over
- [25:50] a,000x performance improvement since the
- [25:53] first generation of TPUs. We're now on
- [25:55] our seventh generation of TPUs, you
- [25:57] know, and efficiency. When you get a
- [25:59] year-over-year efficiency of 2x, I mean,
- [26:00] this is these are significant
- [26:02] engineering accomplishments. But we're
- [26:04] also down in the networking layer. You
- [26:06] know, we're also down in, you know, how
- [26:07] our subc cables route traffic and do
- [26:10] that in a highly performant way. And so
- [26:13] by, you know, our focus is optimizations
- [26:15] at every layer of the stack and those
- [26:18] benefits accreing to our customers. Uh,
- [26:20] and I'm not worried about demand um from
- [26:23] my chair right now.
- [26:24] >> Yeah. Although I want to unpack some of
- [26:27] what you said because you it does sound
- [26:30] like you see us turning a corner from
- [26:33] you know how do we get enough compute to
- [26:35] train these models
- [26:37] to how do we get enough compute to run
- [26:39] these models right that that that is a
- [26:42] fundamental turn and also that that
- [26:45] comes with if you're going to again try
- [26:48] to optimize at every level
- [26:50] >> you want different hardware
- [26:52] >> that is you you know if you're
- [26:54] optimizing for inference that goes down
- [26:57] to the chip level and and
- [26:59] >> these are choices that we're sort of
- [27:01] having to make
- [27:03] >> as we build out two years from now. You
- [27:05] know, looking at the world two years
- [27:06] from now, what are the compute needs
- [27:08] going to be? You do have to choose
- [27:11] between are we going to build out for
- [27:13] training or are we going to build out
- [27:14] for infrastructure?
- [27:15] >> Yeah. Well, and this is something again,
- [27:16] you know, uh you know, Google cloud part
- [27:18] of Google, part of Alphabet. you know,
- [27:20] one of the things that we've learned
- [27:21] over time in uh serving ML at uh web
- [27:25] scale is how to serve ML at webcale. Uh
- [27:29] [laughter]
- [27:29] you know, so this is not a new concept
- [27:31] for us and uh you know, probably the
- [27:34] thing that is most interesting for all
- [27:37] of you is that you know, we have as much
- [27:39] demand for ourselves and for the web.
- [27:43] And so from a like stability of demand
- [27:46] and stability of supply chain and
- [27:48] stability of research and development,
- [27:50] you know, Google cloud was built on
- [27:52] startups. 15 years ago or you know, 12
- [27:54] years ago roughly when I started at
- [27:55] Google cloud, you know, our largest
- [27:57] customers were startups and it was their
- [28:00] ability to scale rapidly kind of the
- [28:03] success disaster, you know, like when
- [28:05] Nano Banana hit, you know, our QPS
- [28:07] estimate was about two orders of
- [28:08] magnitude lower than what it ended up
- [28:10] being. And did it fall over? It
- [28:12] absolutely did not. Why? Because at
- [28:16] Google, we have been building, you know,
- [28:18] scaled infrastructure systems that are
- [28:20] highly reliable, you know, for decades.
- [28:22] And so when you hit the success disaster
- [28:25] with us, we understand like how to
- [28:27] dynamically, you know, drain shard jobs
- [28:30] across, you know, pools. We understand
- [28:33] how to do this inherently in our DNA.
- [28:35] whereas I think a lot of our competitors
- [28:36] are learning on the fly and have some
- [28:39] aspirations and infrastructure that uh
- [28:41] you know maybe exceed their track
- [28:44] record. Um so I'm feeling pretty bullish
- [28:46] about us.
- [28:47] >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're almost out of
- [28:48] time, but I did want to backstage when
- [28:50] we were talking, you had, you know,
- [28:52] there is so much uncertainty around just
- [28:55] the pace of progress has been so fast,
- [28:57] but you had this interesting analogy
- [28:59] between the moment we're at with AI and
- [29:01] the growth of cloud services themselves
- [29:03] where, you know, well, yeah, how did you
- [29:06] put it?
- [29:07] >> Yeah. was uh we tend to evaluate whether
- [29:10] something is good or not based on like
- [29:12] it's far in the future you know best
- [29:14] case scenario which in AI may be like
- [29:18] you know fully autonomous ambient AI
- [29:20] assistant that understands you from a
- [29:22] personal level also understands you at
- [29:24] work and can provide like very proactive
- [29:26] recommendations can run like in parallel
- [29:28] across a whole bunch of work tasks that
- [29:30] you've given it's super complex stuff
- [29:31] and then we go like what's available
- [29:33] today and we get really sad about the
- [29:35] state of things but if you go back to
- [29:37] like cloud. You know, at one point it
- [29:39] was just like I need an API. I need to
- [29:40] like store something outside of my data
- [29:42] center or I need a little bursty compute
- [29:44] for these jobs that have exceeded my
- [29:46] own, you know, envelope. And then over
- [29:48] time it rapidly became, you know, the
- [29:50] foundation for scaled data, scaled
- [29:53] analytics, you know, sovereign uh
- [29:56] compute, all these shapes, all of these
- [29:58] features, all these things emerged. And
- [30:00] we're going to see the exact same thing
- [30:02] in AI. We're in such early days uh in
- [30:05] how AI is going to like evolve and
- [30:07] manifest itself and uh so is a I I like
- [30:11] see the thing repeating and that's why
- [30:13] I'm so excited as you can probably tell
- [30:15] uh about the future and where we're
- [30:16] headed.
- [30:17] >> Well, great note to end on. Thank you so
- [30:19] much for coming down. This was such a
- [30:20] fascinating talk.
