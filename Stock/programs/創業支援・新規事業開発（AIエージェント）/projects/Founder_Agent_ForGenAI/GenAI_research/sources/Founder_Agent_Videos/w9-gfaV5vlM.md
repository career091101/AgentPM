- [00:00] If you want to make money with AI, you
- [00:01] need to stop selling AI agents and
- [00:03] workflows and start selling AI
- [00:04] solutions. And I'm not talking about AI
- [00:06] operating systems or regular
- [00:08] automations. I'm talking about
- [00:09] diagnosing problems that businesses face
- [00:11] and then using AI to solve those
- [00:13] problems. So, in this video, I'm going
- [00:15] to break down why selling agents isn't
- [00:16] enough, what to sell instead that will
- [00:18] actually make you money, and how to do
- [00:19] it yourself step by step. So, why are
- [00:21] you guys all here watching this video?
- [00:23] Because AI has exploded. And with that
- [00:24] explosion comes hype. Tons of people
- [00:26] throwing around buzzwords like agents
- [00:28] and workflows. And what's funny is
- [00:30] automation has been around forever. It's
- [00:31] nothing new. When I was working
- [00:32] full-time at Goldman Sachs in business
- [00:34] intelligence, automation was my entire
- [00:36] role. And that job had existed for
- [00:37] years. But the majority of small and
- [00:39] mid-size businesses, hardly any
- [00:41] automation's in place. The difference
- [00:42] now is that because you slap the word AI
- [00:44] in front of it, suddenly business owners
- [00:46] are paying attention. It's like putting
- [00:47] a neon sign on an old restaurant. The
- [00:49] food hasn't changed. It's nothing new,
- [00:51] but suddenly people are noticing it. And
- [00:52] here's the thing, most beginners get
- [00:54] this part wrong. They get caught up in
- [00:55] the tech, the nodes, the HTTP requests,
- [00:57] the multi- aent architectures. They're
- [00:59] so focused on the shiny parts that it
- [01:01] causes them to forget what actually
- [01:02] matters to businesses. And I've
- [01:03] definitely got carried away with this,
- [01:04] too. In fact, my best performing YouTube
- [01:07] videos are the ones that are really
- [01:08] flashy and have multiple agents because
- [01:10] it was trendy and cooler. But if you
- [01:11] were to ask me which YouTube builds have
- [01:13] actually been the most practical and
- [01:15] highest ROI, it would be some of my
- [01:16] lowest performing videos. When I sold my
- [01:18] very first $1,200 workflow, I didn't
- [01:20] walk in saying, "Hey, I got this build
- [01:22] with 15 nodes and an API call to blah
- [01:24] blah blah." I said, "This will save you
- [01:26] hours every single week on content
- [01:28] creation." And that's what made it a
- [01:29] no-brainer. And here's the truth.
- [01:31] Businesses really only care about three
- [01:33] things: time, money, focus. That's it.
- [01:36] They don't care if you deliver it with
- [01:37] AI or a VA or duct tape and chewing gum.
- [01:40] Think of it like a taxi ride. If you
- [01:41] need to get across town, you don't care
- [01:43] if you ride in a Prius, a Tesla, or a
- [01:45] horsedrawn carriage. Well, I suppose
- [01:46] some of us may, but that's beside the
- [01:48] point. You just care that it gets you to
- [01:49] your destination fast, cheap, and
- [01:51] without stress. Businesses feel the same
- [01:53] way. They don't fanboy over AI itself.
- [01:55] They fanboy over the outcomes. That's
- [01:57] why AIcentric selling doesn't work.
- [01:59] Selling agents or workflows as products
- [02:01] is already a crowded commoditized
- [02:03] market. You've probably seen people
- [02:04] offering entire libraries of end
- [02:06] templates, claiming that you can resell
- [02:08] them all for $5,000 a month. Yet,
- [02:09] they're only charging you $200 to access
- [02:11] that bundle of templates. Why? Because
- [02:13] it's a race to the bottom on price. Take
- [02:16] LinkedIn outreach bots as an example.
- [02:18] You could build the flashiest, most
- [02:19] complex bot out there, but if you just
- [02:21] pitch it as a LinkedIn outreach agent,
- [02:22] nobody's going to care that much. But
- [02:24] when it is framed as a system that helps
- [02:26] you generate qualified leads without
- [02:28] spending on ads, suddenly people see the
- [02:29] value and they want it. The shift is
- [02:31] simple. Stop selling AI tools and start
- [02:33] selling the outcomes of those tools.
- [02:35] Spotlight the pain. Frame the solution
- [02:37] around time, money, and focus. And
- [02:38] that's how you win. And that leads us
- [02:40] right into the next section. What should
- [02:42] you actually be selling? AI solutions.
- [02:44] The difference is an AI workflow is just
- [02:46] a tool. But an AI solution is a tool
- [02:48] that's directly tied to solving an
- [02:50] actual business painoint. When you pitch
- [02:51] a solution, you're not saying, "I'll
- [02:53] build you a chatbot." You're saying,
- [02:54] "I'll cut down your customer support
- [02:55] workload by 60%. I'll automate your
- [02:57] client onboarding so you save 10 hours a
- [02:59] week." Or, "I'll help you create AI
- [03:01] assisted content so you can slash
- [03:02] marketing spend by 30%." And just to get
- [03:04] it to stick, I'll throw one more
- [03:06] terrible analogy at you guys. Think of
- [03:07] it like medicine. If you have a
- [03:09] headache, most people don't care whether
- [03:10] you prescribe Advil, Tylenol, or an
- [03:12] herbal remedy. They just care that their
- [03:14] headache goes away. The pill is the
- [03:15] tool. The outcome is pain relief. That's
- [03:17] exactly how businesses see AI. So the
- [03:19] framework we're going to be talking
- [03:20] about today is to diagnose, then solve,
- [03:23] then value, then price. And it's a
- [03:25] simple process that I use every time.
- [03:27] Diagnose means find the pain point.
- [03:28] Where is the business leaking time,
- [03:30] money, or focus? Solve means build the
- [03:33] system that fixes that exact pain.
- [03:35] Value. Translate that fix into numbers.
- [03:37] Hours saved, dollars saved, revenue
- [03:39] gained. And finally, price. Anchor your
- [03:41] offer around that value. And when you
- [03:42] think about that framework and you think
- [03:44] about the core problem that you're
- [03:45] trying to solve, you can see how
- [03:46] reselling a bundle of 20 edit templates
- [03:48] doesn't really do that. So let's take a
- [03:50] look at an example. Automating client
- [03:52] onboarding. First, we diagnose. Right
- [03:53] now, your team spends 5 hours a week
- [03:55] onboarding new clients. Then we solve.
- [03:57] I'll build a system that can automate
- [03:58] 80% of that. Then we turn that into
- [04:00] value, which is 200 plus hours saved a
- [04:02] year at $50 an hour. That's $10,000 back
- [04:05] in your pocket annually. And then you
- [04:07] price, I'm saving you 10K a year. I'm
- [04:09] only going to charge you 3K right now.
- [04:11] Suddenly, the price isn't a cost. It's
- [04:13] now just a fraction of the value that
- [04:14] they're gaining. Here comes another
- [04:16] analogy. Think of it like a home
- [04:17] renovation. If you're a contractor and
- [04:18] you walk into someone's house and you
- [04:20] say, "I've got the best hammer. I've got
- [04:21] the strongest nails, the fanciest saws,
- [04:23] blah blah blah." Nobody cares. But if
- [04:25] you say, "This remodel will increase
- [04:27] your home's value by $50,000, and we can
- [04:29] do it in half the time of other
- [04:31] contractors." Now, you've got their
- [04:32] attention. The hammer doesn't matter.
- [04:34] The results do. This is why when I'm on
- [04:36] calls, I don't lead with, "Let me show
- [04:38] you my workflow." I lead with questions.
- [04:40] Where are you losing the most time in
- [04:41] your business? What processes do you
- [04:43] wish could run themselves? Because the
- [04:45] diagnosis always points me to the
- [04:47] solution. And the solution always ties
- [04:48] back to measurable business value. And
- [04:50] when you get good at this, you stop
- [04:52] being just another automation
- [04:53] freelancer. You become the person who
- [04:55] can look at a business, spot
- [04:56] inefficiencies, and design solutions
- [04:58] that save them time, money, and focus.
- [05:00] That's the shift from becoming an agent
- [05:02] seller to a solution seller and being
- [05:04] seen as an AI expert or an AI partner.
- [05:06] So, you know why selling AI doesn't work
- [05:08] and that you need to sell AI solutions,
- [05:09] but how do you actually do this for
- [05:10] yourself step by step? That's what we're
- [05:12] going to cover now in a few simple
- [05:13] steps. And remember, we're going to tie
- [05:15] everything back to that same framework
- [05:16] that we just talked about, diagnose,
- [05:18] solve, value, price. Okay, so step one,
- [05:21] pick a niche and diagnose the landscape.
- [05:23] The goal here is simple. Choose one
- [05:25] group so that problems repeat and your
- [05:26] wins compound. Spend 10 minutes deciding
- [05:28] whether you'll serve agencies, real
- [05:30] estate, e-commerce, coaches, local
- [05:32] services like dental or HVAC, SAS
- [05:35] startups, whatever you want it to be.
- [05:36] Run your pick through these quick
- [05:38] filters. Do they repeat processes
- [05:39] weekly? Can they say yes and pay fast?
- [05:41] And do you already speak their language
- [05:43] through content you've made or past work
- [05:45] or interests? When you think about
- [05:46] repeatable pains, picture agencies
- [05:48] struggling with lead qualification,
- [05:49] client onboarding, reporting, and
- [05:51] content ops. Real estate teams juggling
- [05:53] inbound lead triage, showing
- [05:55] coordination, and document collection.
- [05:57] e-commerce brands needing CX ticket
- [05:58] deflection, returns automation, product
- [06:01] content, and ops reporting, or coaches
- [06:02] begging for application filtering,
- [06:04] calendar triage, and content
- [06:05] repurposing. The outcome of this step is
- [06:07] just to have a short list of niches that
- [06:09] you're confident enough to carry into
- [06:11] this next step. Step two, talk to five
- [06:13] to 10 businesses and diagnose pain.
- [06:15] Treat these as informational interviews
- [06:16] that could often turn into discovery
- [06:18] calls and paid work. I like opening with
- [06:20] a simple message. Hey, name, I'm mapping
- [06:22] the top drains in X niche. In 15
- [06:24] minutes, I'll try to quantify your
- [06:26] biggest bottleneck and share where AI
- [06:28] actually helps and where it doesn't. No
- [06:29] pitch unless you ask. I'm genuinely just
- [06:31] trying to learn how I can provide value
- [06:33] to businesses. On the call, I would then
- [06:35] use the LRP framework, the listen,
- [06:38] repeat, poke. This basically means that
- [06:39] I listen while they describe their week
- [06:41] or their processes. I repeat back the
- [06:42] pattern to confirm alignment and then I
- [06:44] poke to quantify it. So, let's say the
- [06:46] business owner is talking to me about
- [06:47] some onboarding and reporting flows and
- [06:49] I find out that it eats about 6 to 8
- [06:51] hours a week. I would then poke back
- [06:52] with a question like whose hours are
- [06:54] those? What's their hourly value? How
- [06:55] often does this process result in an
- [06:57] error? You could also talk about money.
- [06:58] Where are you paying people to copy and
- [07:00] paste or chase info? You could talk
- [07:01] about focus. What interrupts you the
- [07:03] most between 9 and noon? You can talk
- [07:05] about errors. Where do mistakes cause
- [07:06] rework, refunds, or churn? And finally,
- [07:08] you could talk about a trigger. If I
- [07:10] could remove one weekly fire, which one
- [07:12] changes your week? The outcome of this
- [07:14] step is to have a ranked list of actual
- [07:15] business pain points with rough numbers
- [07:17] associated with them. Those numbers
- [07:18] being hours, cost, frequency, mistake
- [07:21] rate, stuff like that. We can then take
- [07:23] that list and move into step three,
- [07:25] which is building one simple solution
- [07:27] and solve. Once you've diagnosed a clear
- [07:29] problem, prototype the fix. And notice
- [07:30] how I just said prototype. This doesn't
- [07:32] have to be a perfect production ready
- [07:34] system. It's a P or a proof of concept
- [07:36] that shows that you understand their
- [07:38] world and it proves your technical
- [07:39] expertise. This doesn't mean you have to
- [07:41] dedicate an entire week to it. Here's
- [07:42] how you could spend one up in an hour
- [07:44] and a half. Spend about 15 minutes
- [07:45] drawing the flow. Now that you
- [07:46] understand the process, just map out the
- [07:48] trigger, the steps, the data sources,
- [07:50] the outputs, and a clear definition of
- [07:52] done. Spend the next hour doing a rough
- [07:54] build on one platform like Nitn so you
- [07:56] have something real to click through and
- [07:58] demo. And then finally, use the last 15
- [07:59] minutes to record a quick 3minute loom
- [08:02] that walks through the before, the
- [08:04] actual solution itself, and then the
- [08:06] result. And make sure you have your
- [08:07] camera on because people want to hire
- [08:08] people, not faceless screens. This is
- [08:10] exactly why my not so fancy LinkedIn
- [08:12] workflow felt like magic to that first
- [08:14] client because it removed the pain of
- [08:15] ideiation, research, and writing. And it
- [08:17] didn't need to be super fancy to do
- [08:19] that. So avoid the classic traps. Don't
- [08:21] drift into multi- aent fantasies. Don't
- [08:23] stitch together five vendors just to try
- [08:25] them. And don't start building a
- [08:26] platform when the job is just to fix
- [08:28] Tuesday's bottleneck. Just try to take a
- [08:30] step back and think about the actual
- [08:31] problem you're trying to solve. Because
- [08:32] a lot of times you may not even need
- [08:34] like a very custom nen agent. Sometimes
- [08:36] there's already a platform out there or
- [08:38] sometimes you can do it already
- [08:39] naturally in someone's CRM. Don't
- [08:41] overengineer. Just be resourceful and
- [08:43] solve problems. The outcome of this step
- [08:45] is that you now have a demo video that
- [08:46] you can send to some of your other
- [08:48] nurtured leads to show them how you can
- [08:50] solve their specific pain points. Next
- [08:51] is step four, which can trip up a lot of
- [08:53] beginners. This is turning your solution
- [08:55] into a price. And the easiest way to do
- [08:57] that is to translate what you built into
- [08:59] plain math that a business owner can
- [09:00] understand and relate to. Here's how I
- [09:02] explain it on calls. First, you have to
- [09:04] figure out how much time the process
- [09:05] takes today. Hopefully, you already did
- [09:07] that earlier in step two. Let's say a
- [09:08] team spends 10 hours a week on client
- [09:10] onboarding. Then ask what those hours
- [09:12] are worth. If the average employee is
- [09:13] paid $25 an hour, that's $250 a week.
- [09:16] Multiply that by 4 weeks to get a month
- [09:18] and suddenly the process is costing the
- [09:20] business around $1,000 a month or
- [09:22] $12,000 annually. Now, let's say you're
- [09:24] only able to automate 60% of that
- [09:26] workload. That's still $600 saved every
- [09:28] single month. Over the course of a year,
- [09:29] that's more than $7,000 back in that
- [09:31] business owner's pocket. So, when you
- [09:33] turn around and say, "Hey, I'm only
- [09:34] going to charge you $3,000 for the
- [09:35] solution." It's not an expense anymore.
- [09:37] It's an investment that has a very
- [09:39] clear, measurable return that already
- [09:40] pays for itself in 5 months, and then
- [09:42] keep saving more money every single
- [09:44] month after that. And that's how you
- [09:45] make it a no-brainer. And of course, you
- [09:46] have to remember that value doesn't
- [09:48] equal time. The client's not paying you
- [09:50] for how long it took. When I built my
- [09:51] very first workflow for $1,200, it only
- [09:53] took me about 2 hours, which is $600 an
- [09:55] hour, which is a crazy rate. But once
- [09:57] again, the client wasn't paying me for
- [09:58] the hours. they were paying for the
- [10:00] outcome, which was saving them hours of
- [10:02] content creation every week. Finally,
- [10:04] make sure to keep your scope clear and
- [10:06] simple. Write down the objective, what's
- [10:08] included, what's not included, the
- [10:10] timeline, what's expected from the
- [10:12] client, the payment terms, stuff like
- [10:14] that. This avoids confusion, ambiguity.
- [10:16] It protects you from scope creep, and it
- [10:17] makes you look professional. The number
- [10:19] one biggest mistake that I made when I
- [10:21] was starting off was underscoping and
- [10:23] then having to deal with all of this
- [10:24] ambiguity. So if you can make your
- [10:25] proposals as specific as possible and
- [10:27] saying these 10 things are the exact
- [10:29] functionality of the system, this is
- [10:31] exactly the definition of done. Then
- [10:33] you're really going to be protecting
- [10:34] yourself and thanking yourself later. So
- [10:36] to recap, the formula is dead simple.
- [10:38] Figure out how much time and money the
- [10:39] process is costing. Now build a PC and
- [10:41] show how your solution cuts down that
- [10:43] time and money and then price your
- [10:44] project at a fraction of those yearly
- [10:46] savings. Businesses will pay happily
- [10:48] when that math makes sense. All right,
- [10:49] moving on to step five, which is to
- [10:51] stack proof, build confidence, and then
- [10:53] scale. I'm gonna be honest real quick.
- [10:55] When you're starting, imposter syndrome
- [10:56] is normal. You're going to wonder if you
- [10:58] can deliver and whether the client will
- [10:59] be happy. I felt the exact same way when
- [11:01] I started working with clients. I wasn't
- [11:02] even calling myself an expert. I was
- [11:04] just curious, building for fun, sharing
- [11:06] things online, and clients started
- [11:07] reaching out. At this stage, I would
- [11:09] have been happy to do work for free just
- [11:11] to get experience. And the fact that I
- [11:12] was getting paid was a big bonus. And if
- [11:14] you're stuck with that worry, you have
- [11:15] two great options. The first one is to
- [11:17] do free or very cheap work in exchange
- [11:19] for proof. Say, "Hey, I'll try this
- [11:21] build out for you for free. Either way,
- [11:23] the system will be yours. I just want to
- [11:24] see if I can help create something
- [11:26] valuable for you in your business. This
- [11:27] removes pressure and lets you optimize
- [11:29] for reps, not money, which is exactly
- [11:31] what you should be doing when you're
- [11:32] starting off because the testimonials
- [11:33] and case studies and confidence that
- [11:35] you're going to gain are worth far more
- [11:36] downstream than a quick $1,200 today.
- [11:38] And those first three to five projects
- [11:40] really should be just thought of as paid
- [11:42] practice. They exist to teach you the
- [11:43] process, give you those case studies,
- [11:45] and provide proof. Your other option is
- [11:47] if you'd rather not do it for free, just
- [11:48] offer a money back guarantee. say, "Hey,
- [11:50] if you're not happy with it when I
- [11:52] deliver it, or it doesn't deliver the
- [11:53] value that we discussed, you'll get all
- [11:55] your money back." That flips the risk,
- [11:56] creates a stress-free environment for
- [11:58] you to learn and experiment, and still
- [11:59] gives the client a fair outcome. This
- [12:01] matters because in the early days, once
- [12:02] again, you're optimizing for experience,
- [12:04] proof, reps, not money. And once you
- [12:06] have all that confidence, you can
- [12:08] actually move from being a freelancer to
- [12:09] a consultant and eventually get larger
- [12:11] and larger builds and larger and larger
- [12:13] contracts. Over the past year, we've
- [12:15] been working on projects that have
- [12:16] ranged anywhere from $1 to $2,000 all
- [12:18] the way up to $30,000 plus. And none of
- [12:20] that would have happened without the low
- [12:22] stakes project that built up my
- [12:23] confidence and portfolio, which let me
- [12:25] comfortably charge more and more every
- [12:27] time we scoped out builds. And honestly,
- [12:28] I still think a lot of our projects
- [12:30] we've undercharged, but that's a
- [12:31] conversation for another time. Anyways,
- [12:33] once you have those first wins under
- [12:34] your belt, make sure you're collecting
- [12:36] that baseline and after data. So, your
- [12:38] hours saved, your errors reduced, your
- [12:40] money saved, and then turn them into
- [12:41] simple case studies. Of course, you want
- [12:43] to ask for testimonials and referrals
- [12:45] and then rerun the framework with new
- [12:46] prospects. But now that you have proof
- [12:48] in hand, it's going to be a lot easier
- [12:50] because at that point, you're no longer
- [12:51] saying, "I think I can help you." You're
- [12:53] saying, "I've already helped three
- [12:54] businesses just like yours. Here's the
- [12:56] proof. Here's the results. Do you want
- [12:58] me to do the same for you?" And that's
- [12:59] when the imposttor syndrome fades
- [13:01] because the market is actually
- [13:02] validating that what you're doing is
- [13:03] working. And that's pretty much the full
- [13:05] loop. Diagnose the problem, solve it
- [13:06] with a simple system, tie it back to
- [13:08] business value, and then price
- [13:09] accordingly. From there, you stack up
- [13:11] your proof until you can scale with
- [13:12] confidence. If you want to succeed at
- [13:14] selling AI, you've got to leave your
- [13:16] obsession for technology behind and
- [13:17] think purely about the customer, aka the
- [13:20] business that you're selling to. So, I
- [13:21] know that was a lot of information.
- [13:22] Tried to make this one as valuable as
- [13:24] possible. What I'm going to do is have
- [13:25] all of this condensed into a resource
- [13:27] that you guys can access and look at
- [13:28] later. I will put that in my free school
- [13:30] community. Once again, completely free.
- [13:32] The link for that will be down in the
- [13:33] description. And if you found this video
- [13:34] helpful and you're looking for a full
- [13:36] course pretty much just like this, then
- [13:37] check out my plus community. The link
- [13:39] for that's also down in the description.
- [13:40] We just dropped a full course in there
- [13:42] called One Person AI Agency. So, you'll
- [13:43] be able to get a formal course material
- [13:45] that goes over starting your oneperson
- [13:46] AI agency from scratch. And the great
- [13:49] thing about that community is we have
- [13:50] over 2,000 other people who are also
- [13:52] trying to do that exact same thing. So,
- [13:53] it's a great space to meet people,
- [13:54] potentially a business partner, and
- [13:56] maybe even make a few hires in there or
- [13:58] pick up your first couple gigs. So, if
- [13:59] you enjoyed the video or you learned
- [14:00] something new, please give it a like.
- [14:02] Definitely helps me out a ton. And as
- [14:03] always, I appreciate you guys making it
- [14:04] to the end of the video. I'll see you
- [14:06] all in the next one. Thanks guys.
