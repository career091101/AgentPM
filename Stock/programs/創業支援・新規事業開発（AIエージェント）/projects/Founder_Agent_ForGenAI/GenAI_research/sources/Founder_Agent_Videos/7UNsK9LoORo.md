- [00:00] Today I'm super excited to share with
- [00:01] you guys this Photoshop AI agent that I
- [00:03] built in Nen with no code. It uses
- [00:05] Google's new nano banana image
- [00:07] generation model which is absolutely
- [00:08] insane. It's really changing the game
- [00:10] for ad creatives and UGC content. So I
- [00:12] don't want to waste any time. We're
- [00:13] going to dive into it and I'm going to
- [00:14] show you guys exactly how this system
- [00:16] works. And as always, I'm going to give
- [00:17] all the resources that you need to set
- [00:19] this up completely free. So stick around
- [00:21] so I can show you guys how to do that.
- [00:22] All right. So here is the master
- [00:24] Photoshop agent. And you can see it's
- [00:25] not too complex. Up front, what we have
- [00:27] is the ability to take text or image as
- [00:29] an input. And then the agent has five
- [00:31] different tools to choose from. It's got
- [00:33] two image genen tools where it can
- [00:34] combine images or edit existing images.
- [00:37] And then it has three file handling
- [00:38] tools in Google Drive where it can
- [00:40] change the name of a file, search
- [00:41] through raw files, or search through AI
- [00:43] generated images that it's created for
- [00:45] us. And it can manage all of this right
- [00:46] in your pocket, right through Telegram.
- [00:48] So let's hop into a demo. Okay, so you
- [00:50] can see that our workflow is listening
- [00:52] to us. I'm going to send a picture on
- [00:53] Telegram.
- [00:55] Okay, so I just shot that off and now
- [00:57] you can see it's uploading that to
- [00:58] Google Drive. The agent's going to see
- [01:00] that and then it's going to ask us what
- [01:02] we want to name that file in our Google
- [01:04] Drive. So there you go. It just
- [01:05] responded with what would you like me to
- [01:07] name that photo? And I'm shooting back a
- [01:09] message that says call it Nate. And what
- [01:11] it's going to do now is use this change
- [01:13] name tool to change the name in our
- [01:15] Google Drive to Nate. As you can see, if
- [01:17] I switch over real quick to media, it
- [01:19] just got called Nate. And originally it
- [01:20] would have been called today's date. So
- [01:22] now it's asking us what we want to do
- [01:23] next. And I'm going to shoot off this
- [01:25] picture of a bag of granola. And once
- [01:27] again, it's going to ask us what do we
- [01:29] want to name this file. And just to show
- [01:31] you guys real quick, in the media folder
- [01:32] that it's dropping, like I said, it
- [01:34] defaults to naming everything today's
- [01:36] date. So now I'm going to show you guys
- [01:37] that it actually does change it. All
- [01:39] right, so shooting off this message that
- [01:40] says to call that picture granola. And
- [01:42] once again, we'll see it go here and
- [01:44] change that picture to granola. And then
- [01:46] we'll have it combine the images
- [01:47] together. All right, that just finished
- [01:49] up. We'll check the media folder, and we
- [01:50] can see that picture got called granola.
- [01:53] Okay, so I've got Telegram open on my
- [01:54] desktop now just to make this easier.
- [01:56] And it's asking us what to do next. I'm
- [01:58] shooting off this message that says,
- [01:59] "Please combine the Nate and granola
- [02:01] pictures to make a photorealistic image
- [02:03] where the man is holding their granola
- [02:05] while hiking on a mountain." So, if you
- [02:07] remember over here, we have a raw file
- [02:08] of granola. We have a smiling selfie of
- [02:11] me. And it's going to put these
- [02:13] together. Right here, you can see it's
- [02:14] using its combined image tool, and it's
- [02:16] going to use nano banana to make it look
- [02:17] like I'm holding the granola on a
- [02:19] mountain. So, I'll check in with you
- [02:20] guys when that's finished up. Oh, and
- [02:22] one other thing. While this is running,
- [02:24] normally the agent would go search
- [02:25] through the files to make sure it has
- [02:27] the right IDs to combine the images. But
- [02:29] because it's using its memory, it
- [02:30] already knows that. So that's why it
- [02:32] didn't hit the other file handling
- [02:33] tools. But you can see we got a response
- [02:35] over here. It's combined the images.
- [02:36] Now, let me click into this Google Drive
- [02:38] link and we'll take a look. So there we
- [02:40] go. We've got the kind granola with all
- [02:41] the spelling correct. We've got me and
- [02:43] my face holding the granola while hiking
- [02:46] on a mountain. And just to show you guys
- [02:48] what that would look like if the files
- [02:49] weren't just immediately uploaded and we
- [02:52] wanted to pull different ones. So let's
- [02:53] see. We have a Hermosi picture right
- [02:54] here that's insanely low quality. We've
- [02:56] got a JBL speaker picture right here. So
- [02:58] what I'm going to do now is say please
- [02:59] combine the Hermosi image with the JBL
- [03:01] speaker image to make it look like the
- [03:03] man is listening to the speaker on a
- [03:04] boat. And now you can see it's searching
- [03:06] through the RAW files. It has those
- [03:08] correct IDs. And now that it has those
- [03:10] file IDs, it can pass that to the
- [03:12] combine images tool in order to actually
- [03:14] send those both to Nano Banana and get
- [03:17] back an image. There you go. You can see
- [03:18] it's calling the combined images tool.
- [03:20] So, I'll check in with you guys when we
- [03:21] get that back. All right, so it just
- [03:23] told us it was done. I'm going to go to
- [03:24] the AI image generation folder, and you
- [03:26] can see we do have a new one. Let's
- [03:27] click in to see how it turned out. Not
- [03:29] too bad at all. We have the JBL speaker.
- [03:31] We've got Hermoszi in his
- [03:32] acquisition.com beater, and it looks
- [03:35] pretty good. And remember, these images
- [03:37] are only going to get better and better
- [03:39] when you come in here and you customize
- [03:40] the prompts and you customize all this
- [03:42] other stuff because what's actually
- [03:44] going on is this agent is creating its
- [03:46] own prompt when it sends over variables
- [03:48] to this workflow. So, if we had a
- [03:50] dedicated agent just focused on like
- [03:52] creating optimized AI image generation
- [03:54] prompts, the results would probably be a
- [03:56] lot better. All right. All right. And
- [03:58] just to show off the functionality of
- [03:59] the edit image tool, I'm going to shoot
- [04:01] off this message that says to create a
- [04:02] photorealistic advertisement of the
- [04:04] granola image, make it look like it's
- [04:06] being held in front of the Eiffel Tower.
- [04:08] So, this one is going to have to find
- [04:09] the file ID of the granola image,
- [04:11] whether that's in the memory or if it
- [04:12] has to search the raw files. Looks like
- [04:14] it just searched the raw files as you
- [04:16] can see. And now it's going to call the
- [04:17] edit image tool in order to change the
- [04:20] appearance of that image. Okay, so looks
- [04:22] like that just finished up. I'm going to
- [04:24] go to the AI image generation folder.
- [04:26] You can see we have granola ad Eiffel.
- [04:28] If I click on it, you can see that it is
- [04:29] our bag of granola which looks exactly
- [04:32] like that and it is being held in front
- [04:34] of the Eiffel Tower. So, if that's not a
- [04:36] good ad creative, then I don't know what
- [04:38] is. And so, all of the words are pretty
- [04:40] much spot-on except for right up here at
- [04:41] the top. As you can see, this is
- [04:43] supposed to say ingredients you can see
- [04:45] and pronounce. But two things, the first
- [04:48] thing is that in the RAW files, this is
- [04:50] a pretty low quality image. So, like I
- [04:52] can't even read what that says right
- [04:53] there. And then the second thing is this
- [04:54] image generation model is only going to
- [04:56] get better and better and of course the
- [04:58] prompting that is in this current
- [04:59] workflow is very minimal. But anyways,
- [05:02] now that you guys have seen how this
- [05:03] works, let's start to dive into what's
- [05:06] going on with all of these nodes. So the
- [05:08] first thing I'm going to start off with
- [05:09] is the text to image input. What happens
- [05:11] here is we're using a switch basically
- [05:13] to detect if a photo exists or if text
- [05:15] exists. And if photo exists, we go up
- [05:18] this way where we download it, upload it
- [05:19] to Google Drive, and then we shoot that
- [05:21] off to the agent. But if text exists,
- [05:23] then we just shoot the text straight
- [05:25] away. But what we have to do is make
- [05:26] sure that the variables are the same so
- [05:28] that it's always coming through in a
- [05:30] field called JSON message.ext. So we
- [05:32] basically just standardize the input so
- [05:34] the agent looks at it no matter what
- [05:36] comes through. Naturally, the next thing
- [05:37] that we'll go over is the system prompt,
- [05:39] which is very, very minimal. I said,
- [05:41] "You are a personal assistant agent.
- [05:43] Your job is to use the tools you have
- [05:44] access to to help the user with their
- [05:46] request." I listed out all the tools and
- [05:49] I gave a very minimal description of
- [05:50] each of them because in the tools
- [05:52] themselves, there's a brief description,
- [05:54] but I still like to put them here. And
- [05:55] then for the instructions, I only ended
- [05:57] up giving it one instruction, which was
- [05:59] if the user submits a photo, ask what
- [06:01] they want to name it by saying, "What
- [06:03] would you like me to name that photo in
- [06:04] your Google Drive?" Then once they
- [06:06] respond, change the name using your
- [06:07] change name tool. The system prompt is
- [06:09] very minimal. We have only five tools to
- [06:11] choose from, and we're using GPD 5.1 and
- [06:14] it's doing really well. And from here,
- [06:15] what I would do is as I'm testing more
- [06:17] and as you guys download the template
- [06:18] and start to play around with different
- [06:20] things, just add instructions to your
- [06:21] system prompt when you realize it's
- [06:23] failing to do certain things. And then
- [06:25] real quick, just to hit on what's going
- [06:26] on over here before we dive into the
- [06:28] tools is we're using GBT 5.1. We're
- [06:30] using Sonnet 3.5 as the fallback model.
- [06:33] And then we're just using simple memory
- [06:35] with the session ID being the Telegram
- [06:36] chat ID. All right, so first I'm going
- [06:39] to go over the file handling tools
- [06:40] because they're super simple and we'll
- [06:42] just get that out the way. The first one
- [06:44] is change name. So if I click into this
- [06:45] tool, you can see what we're doing is
- [06:47] we're updating a file and we're updating
- [06:49] it by the ID and the ID is automatically
- [06:52] found by the agent. So if the agent
- [06:55] doesn't have the ID of a file to change
- [06:56] the name, it will have to go use its
- [06:58] other tools to find that ID and then it
- [07:00] will pass the ID to this tool. And the
- [07:02] other thing that gets passed to this
- [07:03] tool is the new name. So when we say,
- [07:05] hey, call that photo Nate, it knows to
- [07:07] fill this in right here with the word
- [07:09] Nate. And then these tools are doing the
- [07:11] exact same thing. The only difference is
- [07:13] the folder that they're searching in. So
- [07:15] if I say to search for raw files, what
- [07:17] we're doing is we're searching within a
- [07:19] folder called media and we're searching
- [07:21] for files. But if the agent realizes
- [07:23] that we want to search through an image
- [07:24] that it already created for us, it would
- [07:26] use this one which is search AI images
- [07:28] and it's doing the exact same thing
- [07:30] except for we change the folder that
- [07:31] it's looking through. So like I said,
- [07:33] those three are super simple, but those
- [07:34] are necessary in order to change things,
- [07:37] look at things, and search through the
- [07:39] database. Okay, so now let's get into
- [07:41] the fun stuff which are these two custom
- [07:42] workflows that I built. And what that
- [07:44] means is if I open up this workflow, you
- [07:46] can see that it is a custom Nadin
- [07:49] workflow that I built myself. We're able
- [07:51] to make our main agent call on it
- [07:53] because you can see that if we add a
- [07:54] tool right here, we have an option to
- [07:56] call an Nin workflow as a tool. So
- [07:58] that's how we can create these really
- [07:59] modular systems because now if I ever
- [08:02] want to create another agent that can
- [08:03] combine images, I can just plug it into
- [08:05] this workflow right here. So anyways,
- [08:07] there's a lot of stuff going on here. So
- [08:09] let's just take it node by node. The
- [08:11] first thing that's going on is we have
- [08:12] the input where I'm defining to the main
- [08:15] Photoshop agent what to send over. So
- [08:18] you can see we're sending over an image
- [08:19] prompt, image one, which is an image ID,
- [08:22] image two, which is the image ID of the
- [08:24] second image, and then the image title
- [08:26] for the new image that's created. And
- [08:28] that may seem a little confusing, but
- [08:29] when we go back to the main Photoshop
- [08:31] agent, it looks at this and it says,
- [08:33] "Okay, when I need to call this tool,
- [08:34] which is combining images, I need to
- [08:37] send over a prompt, image one, image
- [08:39] two, and image title." So, this is how
- [08:41] it knows to use its brain to give the
- [08:43] second workflow all of this information.
- [08:45] And to make this easier, I pulled in the
- [08:47] live data from that run we did in the
- [08:49] demo, just so you guys can see that what
- [08:51] comes in is here's the image with
- [08:53] Hormosi in the speaker. Here's the ID of
- [08:55] the first one, the ID of the second one,
- [08:57] and the new name of the AI generated
- [08:59] image. So from there, what we do is we
- [09:01] edit fields just to create an array of
- [09:03] the two image IDs. We have to create an
- [09:06] array so that we can split these out
- [09:08] into two separate items because we need
- [09:09] to download two files and we need to get
- [09:11] a public URL of both of those files. So
- [09:14] in the Google Drive node, we're
- [09:15] downloading by ID. So you can see we're
- [09:17] getting both of these pictures here.
- [09:18] There's the Hormosi one and there is the
- [09:20] speaker one. And then the way that the
- [09:21] nano banana API works, it has to take a
- [09:24] public URL of an image in order to
- [09:26] actually change it. So what we do is we
- [09:28] use a free service called image BB and
- [09:30] I'm basically just uploading these
- [09:32] images as binary and then it gives us
- [09:34] back a public URL that represents the
- [09:36] image. So here you can see this is what
- [09:37] we get back and if I open that up, it is
- [09:39] the picture of Herozi.
- [09:41] So that's just a cool little workaround
- [09:43] if you need to get an binary image into
- [09:45] a public URL. There's other ways to do
- [09:46] it, but this is just a free easy way
- [09:48] that I do it. So once we have both those
- [09:50] URLs back, we aggregate them so that we
- [09:52] can make one API request rather than
- [09:54] two. So we're making one request to Nano
- [09:57] Banana through a service called FAL AI.
- [10:00] So I'm not going to dive super super
- [10:01] deep into what's going on here. If you
- [10:03] want to watch an API video I made, I'll
- [10:04] tag that right up here. But what's going
- [10:06] on is we're using our foul credentials.
- [10:09] So I got my API key from foul.ai. And
- [10:12] then this JSON body request is really
- [10:13] simple. We're passing over a prompt and
- [10:15] we're passing over two image URLs. And
- [10:18] the only reason why this prompt looks a
- [10:19] little confusing is because I put these
- [10:21] two replace functions in there that
- [10:23] basically make sure if the prompt has
- [10:26] new lines or um double quotation marks
- [10:29] that it gets rid of that because that
- [10:31] would break the JSON body request. So
- [10:33] now it has everything it needs. It has
- [10:34] both the images and it has the prompt.
- [10:36] And then it basically says, "Okay, I
- [10:38] received your request. We're working on
- [10:40] that right now." And because it's
- [10:41] working on it, we wait for about 10
- [10:43] seconds and then we make a request back
- [10:45] to foul to see if it's done. And if it's
- [10:47] not done, it will come here and it will
- [10:49] wait for 30 seconds. And honestly, this
- [10:50] should probably change to like four
- [10:52] because images are really quick. And
- [10:55] then it will just continuously check
- [10:56] until it's done. So that's just another
- [10:58] cool guard rail you can have in your
- [10:59] workflows. And then once it gets that
- [11:02] result back, it basically gives us a
- [11:03] URL. And so what I do is I make a simple
- [11:05] git request to that URL to actually get
- [11:08] the image itself. And now we have the
- [11:10] image as binary. We can upload it to
- [11:12] Google Drive. And then we can set our
- [11:14] response to the main agent which is
- [11:15] basically saying, "Hey, the image was
- [11:17] created and this is what we named it and
- [11:19] here's the link to that image in your
- [11:20] Google Drive." And then the main agent
- [11:22] gets that and responds to us, the user.
- [11:24] So hopefully that wasn't too confusing
- [11:26] and at a high level you can understand
- [11:27] what's going on. Remember this will be a
- [11:30] free workflow you guys can download in
- [11:31] my free school community as well. So the
- [11:35] best way to really understand it is to
- [11:36] download all the assets, run it, and
- [11:38] then go node by node and understand
- [11:40] what's going on. And real quick, the way
- [11:41] you would actually get all this is you
- [11:43] join my free school community. The link
- [11:44] for that down in the description. When
- [11:46] you get there, this is what it will look
- [11:47] like. And all you need to do is go to
- [11:49] YouTube resources and find the post
- [11:51] associated with this video. If you're
- [11:53] having trouble finding it, you can also
- [11:54] use the search bar to search for the
- [11:55] title of the video. But then once you
- [11:57] get in there, you'll see the video and
- [11:59] then you'll also see all of these JSON
- [12:01] files that you can download and then
- [12:02] import directly into your NAD. And then
- [12:05] when you get all the stuff set up, there
- [12:06] will be a big sticky note right here
- [12:08] called a setup guide and it will tell
- [12:09] you exactly what you need to do to get
- [12:11] up and running. Okay, cool. So that was
- [12:13] the combine images node where we used
- [12:15] nanobanana. Now what's cool is the edit
- [12:18] image node is very very similar. So if I
- [12:21] open this up and I actually just click
- [12:22] on view subexecution, we can see exactly
- [12:25] what happened when it was called. And
- [12:27] it's very similar to the previous one.
- [12:29] Literally the only difference is that
- [12:31] instead of passing in two image IDs,
- [12:34] we're only passing in one. So what
- [12:36] happens once again is the input is image
- [12:38] title, image prompt, and image ID. So
- [12:41] here's the run from the granola Eiffel
- [12:42] Tower ad. As you can see, we're going to
- [12:45] go to Google Drive once again, pass in
- [12:46] that image ID so we can download the
- [12:48] file. Then what comes next is we are
- [12:51] once again sending that binary data to
- [12:53] imageB to get a public URL. So right
- [12:56] here you can see this is the public URL
- [12:58] we get for our granola picture.
- [13:01] And then now that we have that we can
- [13:02] make another request to FAI to use
- [13:04] Nanobanana where we send over the prompt
- [13:07] and then just one image URL instead of
- [13:09] two. So it's very very similar. We're
- [13:11] using the same guardrails in here to get
- [13:13] rid of new lines and new spaces and um
- [13:16] quotation marks, all that kind of stuff.
- [13:17] And then it basically just edits that
- [13:19] image. We're doing the exact same thing
- [13:21] here with a polling check. And then when
- [13:23] we get the result, we download it as
- [13:25] binary rather than keeping it as a URL,
- [13:28] put it in our Google Drive, and then we
- [13:29] send a response back to the main agent.
- [13:32] Real quick, just wanted to touch on some
- [13:33] of the pricing for this system. The
- [13:35] first thing that I wanted to cover was
- [13:37] foul.ai.
- [13:38] What foul is is like a place where you
- [13:40] can have a ton of different image and
- [13:42] video generation models and you can just
- [13:44] use one credential and, you know, get
- [13:46] all of them through there. So, it's
- [13:47] really cool. You can see right here my
- [13:48] recently used our Nano Banana Edit.
- [13:50] We've got V3 fast, V3. You can go to
- [13:53] explore and you can see all of these
- [13:55] other models that they have available.
- [13:57] But anyways, the reason why I wanted to
- [13:58] show you guys this is because first of
- [14:00] all, it's only about 4 cents per image,
- [14:02] which is not too bad at all. But what
- [14:03] you can do is you can play around with
- [14:05] like image URLs and prompts here. So you
- [14:07] can really refine the way you want to
- [14:09] have your prompting before you get into
- [14:11] Nen and start messing around there. And
- [14:13] then the way that we can call it through
- [14:14] nen is by going to their API
- [14:16] documentation. I would change this to
- [14:18] HTTP curl. And now you can look through
- [14:20] like how to get your API key, how to set
- [14:22] that up, how to submit a request, how to
- [14:23] upload files, all this kind of stuff.
- [14:26] And I also did see about a week ago that
- [14:28] you could get free image generation
- [14:29] through Open Router for Gemini Nano
- [14:31] Banana because if you go to the Gemini
- [14:33] web app, it's free to try out there. And
- [14:36] so for a while it was free here on Open
- [14:37] Router, but it looks like they might
- [14:38] have just taken that off. So
- [14:42] unfortunate, but once again, you can get
- [14:44] 25 images for only a dollar. So it's not
- [14:46] too bad. Okay, so that's basically all
- [14:48] that's going on in this workflow. Now,
- [14:50] let's talk about a few ways that when
- [14:52] you get this template that you could
- [14:54] customize this and make it a little more
- [14:56] production ready. So, something that I
- [14:58] alluded to earlier was in these two
- [15:00] tools where you're doing image
- [15:01] generation would be to have a dedicated
- [15:04] AI that would create the system prompts
- [15:06] or the AI image generation prompts. So
- [15:08] what you could do is like literally
- [15:09] right here just add an AI agent node and
- [15:12] this one is prompted in a way where it's
- [15:14] specializing in creating AI image
- [15:17] generated prompts and then you pass that
- [15:19] prompt all the way down to the create
- [15:20] image node rather than relying on this
- [15:23] main agent who has tons of other jobs to
- [15:25] do relying on him to make the image
- [15:27] prompt. It would be better to have a
- [15:29] second agent in this workflow that would
- [15:31] specialize in that. There's of course
- [15:33] other things you can do like having a
- [15:34] logger. So in a previous agent I've made
- [15:36] that was kind of similar. This one was
- [15:37] an ultimate media team. What I did here
- [15:40] was I had it returning all of its steps
- [15:42] into a Google sheet, whether it errored
- [15:44] or it was successful. So you could see
- [15:46] exactly what input was processed, what
- [15:48] tools were called, how many tokens that
- [15:49] was taking you. So you could use this
- [15:51] video, which I will tag right up here if
- [15:53] you haven't seen it. You can download
- [15:54] those resources and do the exact same
- [15:56] thing in this agent where you can have a
- [15:58] Google sheet that's logging everything.
- [15:59] And then of course another really cool
- [16:01] next step would be being able to take
- [16:02] these AI generated images and pass that
- [16:05] to another workflow that can create
- [16:07] videos out of them and you could use
- [16:08] like V3 fast to create those images for
- [16:11] you. That's another thing that I did in
- [16:13] this media agent where I have like an
- [16:14] image tovide tool, a create video tool.
- [16:16] So definitely check out that video as
- [16:18] well if you want to literally use some
- [16:20] of these workflows and then just hook
- [16:22] them up to your Photoshop agent and
- [16:24] because that's the beauty of these
- [16:25] custom workflows as a tool. you can have
- [16:27] them hooked up to as many different
- [16:28] agents as you want. So once again, all
- [16:30] the resources for this video and every
- [16:31] single other YouTube video you've seen
- [16:33] on my channel, you can get for
- [16:34] completely free in my free school
- [16:36] community, you just have to come here,
- [16:37] look through the YouTube resources, and
- [16:39] as you can see, every single video has
- [16:41] all of the resources right here. And if
- [16:43] you're looking to take your skills a
- [16:44] little further with NINDN and you're
- [16:46] also looking to understand how you can
- [16:47] monetize your AI automation knowledge,
- [16:49] then definitely check out my plus
- [16:51] community. The link for that will also
- [16:52] be down in the description. We've got
- [16:53] thousands of members in here who are
- [16:55] building and selling end services every
- [16:57] single day and they're always sharing
- [16:58] their learnings and their challenges.
- [17:00] It's a really cool space to be. We've
- [17:01] also got two full courses at the moment
- [17:03] with a third one coming about monetizing
- [17:04] your AI skills. But if you're a complete
- [17:06] beginner, you can start with the
- [17:07] foundations and then you get in here and
- [17:08] you master nen and then you learn how to
- [17:10] start selling or consulting with this
- [17:12] knowledge. So, I'd love to see you guys
- [17:14] in these communities. But that's going
- [17:15] to do it for the video. If you enjoyed
- [17:16] or you learned something new, please
- [17:17] give it a like. It definitely helps me
- [17:19] out a ton. And as always, I appreciate
- [17:20] you guys making it to the end of the
- [17:21] video. I'll see you on the next one.
- [17:23] Thanks everyone.
