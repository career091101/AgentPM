- [00:00] Hey guys, I was just able to compete in
- [00:02] Google's second episode of the AI Agent
- [00:05] Bakeoff, which is a fivehour challenge
- [00:08] where we had to build a brand new
- [00:10] Agentic banking application in just
- [00:13] under 5 hours. And thanks to enough
- [00:15] caffeine and the right strategies, I was
- [00:18] able to win with my partner. So, in
- [00:20] today's video, I want to break down
- [00:22] those exact strategies I used into five
- [00:24] helpful tips that you can copy and steal
- [00:27] for your own workflows to build better
- [00:29] and faster agent workflows for your own
- [00:31] applications. Also, if you haven't had a
- [00:33] chance to watch the entire episode that
- [00:35] Google just produced where we're all
- [00:37] competing and building out the best
- [00:38] agents, I definitely recommend you
- [00:40] checking out that full video. I'll have
- [00:41] a link to it down in the description
- [00:42] below. But don't worry, I'll still give
- [00:44] you guys a quick recap of all the
- [00:46] important things as we break it down
- [00:47] here in this video as well. And because
- [00:49] you guys are awesome, I'm going to be
- [00:50] giving away the entire source code for
- [00:52] the project I built during the bake off
- [00:54] completely for free. Just click the link
- [00:56] down the description below so you can
- [00:57] get access to the front-end application,
- [00:59] plus all the different agents that I
- [01:01] built under the hood. But enough of
- [01:02] that. Let's go ahead and dive into
- [01:04] breaking down everything that went into
- [01:06] building out this agent project so you
- [01:08] can start to copy my tips and tricks for
- [01:09] building real world agents. All right.
- [01:11] So, what I want to do is paint the
- [01:13] picture of exactly what we were getting
- [01:15] ourselves into in this competition
- [01:17] because in a matter of five hours, we
- [01:19] had to go from a list of instructions,
- [01:22] requirements, all the way to a
- [01:23] full-blown working application that we
- [01:25] could show off to the judges. So, I just
- [01:27] want you guys to see how much we had to
- [01:29] do in 5 hours because you're going to
- [01:32] see, man, this is an insane amount of
- [01:33] work and the only way I was able to get
- [01:35] it done is by doing like AIdriven
- [01:37] development. So, that's exactly what I'm
- [01:39] going to be sharing with you guys in the
- [01:40] five tips section, but I just want to
- [01:41] paint a picture of what did we have to
- [01:43] build, what did we build, and then the
- [01:45] rest of the video, I'm going to show you
- [01:46] how we got there. So, let's break down
- [01:48] what we were tasked with doing because
- [01:50] this was a ton of fun, but stressful
- [01:53] because we had so much to build in such
- [01:55] short time. So, we had to create a
- [01:57] multi- aent system that builds the
- [01:59] future of personal finance. Now, what
- [02:01] does that actually mean? Well, we needed
- [02:03] to build out a beautiful UI where users
- [02:06] could go in and engage with agents. We
- [02:09] had to make sure that our agents we were
- [02:11] building offered proactive guidance to
- [02:13] help people accomplish their major life
- [02:15] goals for budgeting, doing vacations.
- [02:17] Outside of that, we needed to make sure
- [02:19] that our agents were intelligent. So,
- [02:21] not only did we need to include chat
- [02:23] bots where people could actively talk to
- [02:25] these agents, but we had to add in
- [02:27] workflows that automated a lot of the
- [02:29] works that people would normally go do
- [02:31] when like planning a trip and stuff like
- [02:32] that. Outside of that, just like you
- [02:34] would have to do in Top Chef where
- [02:36] you're like instructed to go make a
- [02:37] certain type of dish. Well, you have to
- [02:40] use certain ingredients as well. So,
- [02:42] inside of the bake off, we had to use
- [02:44] certain ingredients such as or in our
- [02:45] case certain technologies such as agent
- [02:47] development kit. We had to use the agent
- [02:49] agent protocol and we had to use Gemini
- [02:51] API. So this was a ton of fun. But what
- [02:53] I want to do is just break down like
- [02:55] let's actually get really concrete and
- [02:57] let me show you exactly what Google was
- [02:59] basically asking us to build. So at the
- [03:02] end of the day, here's what Google was
- [03:03] saying. They're saying, "Hey, we already
- [03:05] have an existing bank. It's boring. It's
- [03:07] an old bank, but this bank does come
- [03:09] with a backend and a front end, but most
- [03:11] importantly, this bank comes with an
- [03:13] agent. And as time goes on, agents
- [03:16] become more powerful and more prevalent.
- [03:17] Agentto agent protocol is going to
- [03:19] become huge where you are going to have
- [03:21] agents that are going to be talking to
- [03:23] other agents inside of companies to
- [03:25] where they do all the work and basically
- [03:27] make things magic for us. So what Google
- [03:29] was asking us to do inside this
- [03:31] competition is to build out everything
- [03:33] that you see right here in 5 hours.
- [03:36] Meaning we had to create a custom
- [03:38] application and we had to for each one
- [03:41] of the main topics that we were asked to
- [03:43] do like working with financial
- [03:45] statements, helping people plan their
- [03:47] goals, you know, a bunch of like
- [03:49] analyzing perks that might be available
- [03:50] to the customers inside the bank. Like
- [03:53] we had to build out agent workflows for
- [03:55] each one of these, which is insane for 5
- [03:57] hours. Not only that, but we had to
- [03:59] figure out how to connect our agents to
- [04:01] the bank's agent and we were able to do
- [04:03] that thanks to the A2A protocol. So, as
- [04:05] you can see, this was a ton of work, but
- [04:07] let me actually just show you a quick
- [04:08] overview of the application that was
- [04:10] built. So, you can see, you know, this
- [04:11] is what me and my partner built in 5
- [04:14] hours. So, super super powerful and
- [04:17] super super proud of what we built. So,
- [04:18] this is a full-blown application. So,
- [04:21] you can see we have multiple tabs to
- [04:23] help people achieve their different
- [04:24] goals. So, we have in each one of these
- [04:27] pages correlates to different agents and
- [04:29] agent workflows. So, you can see we have
- [04:31] spending. So inside this we have a
- [04:34] spending agent workflow where we had an
- [04:36] agent go off and analyze the person's
- [04:38] income, expenses, recent activities.
- [04:40] Outside of that we also had a you know a
- [04:43] other agent that was responsible for
- [04:46] asking and answering questions on
- [04:48] everything that you see on this page. So
- [04:50] as you can see like this was a ton of
- [04:52] work that had to get done in multiple
- [04:54] hours. So this is one part, this is
- [04:56] another part and this gets repeated on
- [04:58] every single page. And this was the way
- [05:01] I wanted to structure building out the
- [05:02] application. Definitely recommend you
- [05:04] checking out the full episode so you can
- [05:05] see how other people tackled it. But
- [05:07] once again, super excited for it to work
- [05:09] and just to show you guys, you can see
- [05:10] like what did I spend the most on this
- [05:12] month? This is triggering off an agent
- [05:14] that's asking questions over here about
- [05:16] what was spent on. So you can see the
- [05:18] most expensive thing that we did last
- [05:20] month was rent and you can see it right
- [05:22] here. So yeah, all around like it's a
- [05:24] working application. You can try it out.
- [05:26] You'll learn a ton of cool insights on
- [05:28] how we set up the agents to actually
- [05:29] handle working with Ato. So yeah,
- [05:32] there's a ton inside of here. I won't go
- [05:34] super super deep into actually how
- [05:36] everything was built. I definitely
- [05:38] recommend you guys hopping inside of
- [05:40] here and just asking AI like, "Hey,
- [05:42] please walk me through this." There's a
- [05:44] ton of cool really interesting places
- [05:45] that you can use to jump start your own
- [05:47] full stack AI development journey. But
- [05:49] what I want to mostly focus on is how
- [05:52] the heck were we able to build
- [05:54] everything that you see over here in
- [05:57] five hours from all the agents to the
- [05:58] full stack application to the agents
- [06:00] having tools to do a like this was a
- [06:02] monster task and I want to show you how
- [06:04] we did it in 5 hours and I'm going to
- [06:06] break it down right now in five tips
- [06:08] that you guys can copy. So the first tip
- [06:09] I want to share with you guys is the
- [06:11] concept of an AI reference project. Now,
- [06:14] this one tip alone is the single most
- [06:17] important tip that allowed me to go and
- [06:19] build out this full stack AI application
- [06:22] in a matter of 5 hours instead of 5 days
- [06:25] or more, truthfully. And the best way to
- [06:28] fully understand this tip, and don't
- [06:29] worry, I'm going to share examples of
- [06:30] how I actually did it. But the main
- [06:32] thing that you need to understand before
- [06:34] diving into what is an AI reference
- [06:37] project, you need to understand the new
- [06:39] job promotion you just got thanks to AI
- [06:41] agents. So you are now an AI developer.
- [06:45] You're no longer a software developer.
- [06:46] You're an AI software developer. What
- [06:49] that means is at this point you should
- [06:51] probably never be writing a single line
- [06:52] of code again. I have not written a
- [06:54] single line of code in probably close to
- [06:57] 2 years at this point. What I have been
- [06:59] doing though and what I recommend you
- [07:00] guys to do and exactly what I did in
- [07:02] this competition is I provided context
- [07:05] to AI agents. What that means is I'm
- [07:08] telling AI here's what you should be
- [07:10] doing. Here's why you should be doing
- [07:11] it. And ideally, here is an example of
- [07:15] how you should do it. And that's what
- [07:17] really what I mean by AI reference. We
- [07:19] are referencing existing working code
- [07:22] and different projects so that we can
- [07:24] just go exponentially faster. So, let me
- [07:27] break down a little bit more what the
- [07:28] role means and then I'm going to break
- [07:30] down exactly how to apply and explain
- [07:32] what AI reference projects are. Okay.
- [07:33] So, here's what I mean. At this point,
- [07:35] our job is to provide context to AI
- [07:37] agents. We're not coding anymore. If
- [07:38] you're coding, you're going slow. So
- [07:40] what do we need to be doing as AI
- [07:42] software developers? Well, our job is to
- [07:44] know what exists. So what does a ad ADK
- [07:47] do? What does A2A do? What is possible
- [07:49] with these frameworks? What can I do
- [07:51] with ADK? What can't I do with ADK? When
- [07:53] it comes to A2A, what does it allow
- [07:56] agents to do? And also more importantly,
- [07:59] we need to know where can I find working
- [08:01] samples and examples of these different
- [08:04] frameworks. So, is there a example
- [08:07] project of ADK working properly? Is
- [08:09] there a working example of ADK using A2A
- [08:13] properly? Because if there is, there's
- [08:15] no reason for me to actually, you know,
- [08:17] type out and explain and manually type
- [08:19] out, all right, new function, go get
- [08:22] this, you know, card from this other
- [08:24] agent. No, what I should be doing is I
- [08:26] should be passing that information over
- [08:28] to AI and say, hey, AI, I know that this
- [08:31] tool can do it. Here's an example of
- [08:33] another project doing what I want. and I
- [08:35] would like you to tweak it for our use
- [08:36] case. That is what we should be doing in
- [08:39] the world of being AI developers. And
- [08:41] this is exactly what I did to crank out
- [08:44] five days work of work in 5 hours. So
- [08:47] let me give you a concrete example. In
- [08:48] our case, as you saw, we have to build
- [08:50] out an ADK application that has a full
- [08:53] stack application using ADK where ADK is
- [08:56] using A2A to talk to the bank agent. So
- [09:00] my whole job going into this competition
- [09:02] knowing my new role as a AI developer is
- [09:05] I'm like man I have to get smart on what
- [09:07] ADK can do. I have to get smart on
- [09:09] finding example projects. So when it is
- [09:11] game time I can say and just hey agents
- [09:14] go to work. Here's exactly what I want
- [09:15] you to build. So what does this actually
- [09:17] mean inside of your projects? Like what
- [09:20] should you be doing? Well what you
- [09:22] should be doing is you should be
- [09:24] preparing your projects to have a
- [09:26] reference folder. This reference folder
- [09:28] is combined with every type of project
- [09:30] reference that you can find. So you
- [09:32] should be looking up and adding in
- [09:34] existing applications. So in my case,
- [09:36] I've already built out A2A applications
- [09:39] in the past. I have found a ton of ADK
- [09:43] documents that explain exactly what you
- [09:46] can and can't do. I have projects of ADK
- [09:50] for building out tons of different
- [09:52] projects. So these are all different
- [09:53] projects that Google has created to
- [09:56] showcase the different powers of agents.
- [09:58] Outside of that, there is other agents
- [10:01] where there's projects that showcase how
- [10:03] to use ADK plus A2A. So my job at this
- [10:07] point, heck, there's even an A2A samples
- [10:09] repository that shows exactly how to use
- [10:12] ADK plus A2A. So my job is just to go
- [10:16] search the internet and I'm going to use
- [10:18] AI to do it. But I'm going to go search
- [10:19] all example projects and basically
- [10:22] prepare and stack the deck in my favor
- [10:24] when I'm going to start a new project.
- [10:25] So whenever it's time to hit go, I
- [10:27] already have a thousand repositories of
- [10:30] projects that explain exactly what
- [10:32] functionality we need to build. So in
- [10:34] our case when it comes to building out
- [10:36] this application all I'm basically
- [10:38] saying is like hey I would like you to
- [10:41] look at project one where they connected
- [10:44] their ADK agents to ATA. I would like
- [10:46] you to look at project two where they
- [10:48] connected ADK to the front end. And when
- [10:51] it comes to project three I would like
- [10:53] you to look at how they built out multi-
- [10:56] aent workflows where they had agent one
- [10:58] work with agent two to then spit out a
- [11:00] result. So, I'm hoping you guys can see
- [11:02] at this point the kicker here is we just
- [11:04] need to be basically understanding what
- [11:07] is possible and then just having like
- [11:09] you know in our heads just a bunch of
- [11:11] like little memories of like I remember
- [11:13] that did that I remember that did that.
- [11:14] So whenever it comes time to coding, we
- [11:16] can just pass all this into our
- [11:18] projects, specifically inside of our
- [11:20] reference folder, and then let our
- [11:22] agents do the work. Because the agents,
- [11:23] they're so smart. The second they see
- [11:25] the code from here and the code from
- [11:27] this other project, they'll go, "Oh
- [11:28] yeah, I can copy that for your new
- [11:30] project. That's going to be so easy.
- [11:31] Thank you for providing the necessary
- [11:33] context so I can implement exactly what
- [11:35] you want." So I'm hoping this is super
- [11:37] helpful cuz this is the exact process I
- [11:40] did to crank out weeks worth of work in
- [11:42] 5 days. All right, so let's go ahead and
- [11:43] hop over to tip number two because if
- [11:45] you thought this one was super helpful,
- [11:47] you're going to love tip number two.
- [11:48] Also, if you're liking the idea of
- [11:50] reference projects, you're absolutely
- [11:51] going to love what we built for you
- [11:52] inside of Shipkit.AI, which is a
- [11:55] combination of pre-built ready projects,
- [11:58] AIdriven courses, and everything else
- [12:00] you need to launch AI applications in
- [12:02] days instead of months. And just inside
- [12:05] of Shipkit, like I said, you're going to
- [12:07] have access to a course where you get to
- [12:09] learn how to go from an idea. And AI is
- [12:11] going to help you every step along of
- [12:12] the way to go from idea to a full-blown
- [12:14] application to deploying your
- [12:16] application. Like I said, we have every
- [12:18] type of common AI project you would like
- [12:19] to use. Everything from agent
- [12:21] development kit to rag to chat,
- [12:23] everything. We have a full-blown
- [12:25] pre-existing AI application that's
- [12:27] working. You get the source code for it.
- [12:29] You also get example walkthroughs of how
- [12:31] I converted each one of these pre-built
- [12:34] templates over into a custom project.
- [12:36] And you get to see exact breakdowns of
- [12:38] how everything works. So, Shipkit is the
- [12:41] number one tool if you're looking to
- [12:42] build out real world AI projects using
- [12:45] these new technologies and tips and
- [12:46] tricks and see exactly how I build real
- [12:48] world applications in days instead of
- [12:50] months. And if you're looking to get
- [12:51] Shipkit, we're doing $50 off if you want
- [12:53] to use code bake off. And if you have
- [12:55] any questions, feel free, let me know.
- [12:57] But I definitely recommend checking
- [12:58] watching this video if you have any
- [13:00] questions or shoot me an email. But
- [13:01] yeah, thanks guys and let's get back to
- [13:03] tip number two. So the second tip I want
- [13:05] to show you guys is that you need to be
- [13:07] talking to your computer and this
- [13:10] absolutely broke everyone's brain at the
- [13:12] competition because everyone else is
- [13:14] sitting, you know, heads down, earphones
- [13:16] in, and they're just typing as fast as
- [13:18] they can. And I, on the other hand, am
- [13:20] just talking to my computer saying like,
- [13:22] hey, I think we should build this. Oh,
- [13:24] and this needs to connect to this. And
- [13:25] basically I'm just talking. And the way
- [13:27] I'm able to do that is using the tool
- [13:29] called Whisper Flow. And Whisper Flow
- [13:31] literally just listens to you. And they
- [13:33] have a bunch of cool tools in here to
- [13:35] help out if you're using tools like
- [13:37] Cursor or Claude Code where they'll also
- [13:39] look at your files and add them in. And
- [13:40] at this point, why I love Whisper Flow
- [13:43] so much is because I'm able to just go
- [13:45] as fast as I can talk. So if I can talk
- [13:47] faster, it'll listen. If I talk slower,
- [13:49] it'll listen. It doesn't matter. At this
- [13:50] point, I wish I could talk and type at
- [13:53] 122 words per minute, but my fingers
- [13:54] just don't do it. And it's so much
- [13:56] easier just to sit back in your chair,
- [13:57] look up, and just describe what you want
- [13:59] and talk and then have the AI build it
- [14:01] for you. It's a funny thing at first,
- [14:03] but the second you start doing it,
- [14:04] you'll never go back to typing unless
- [14:06] you have to like, you know, call out
- [14:08] something specific. But just when you're
- [14:09] trying to solve the context problem,
- [14:11] which is what we're trying to do right
- [14:12] now, we're trying to put as much context
- [14:15] in our heads into the computer as
- [14:16] possible on how to solve the problem so
- [14:18] the agent can go off and do the work.
- [14:19] So, the more you can talk, the more you
- [14:21] can explain what you're looking for,
- [14:23] what problems you're running into, and
- [14:24] what the ideal goal state is, the better
- [14:26] these agents are going to do. And that's
- [14:27] why I love Whisper Flow because it
- [14:29] breaks down that barrier of preventing
- [14:31] me from putting more context into the
- [14:33] system. And if you want to get uh
- [14:35] Whisper Flow, not sponsored by them or
- [14:37] anything like that, which I was, but I
- [14:39] have a link in the description below
- [14:40] where you guys can get two months for
- [14:42] free of Whisper Flow. Absolutely love
- [14:43] it. But what I want to show you is just
- [14:45] Whisper Flow in action really fast. So,
- [14:47] I can update the shortcuts on my
- [14:49] computer to where whenever I now hit the
- [14:51] option and spacebar. I get this to where
- [14:54] I can just talk to my computer, it's
- [14:55] listening in real time. You can see down
- [14:57] here at the bottom of my screen, it has
- [14:58] the little squiggies. And this is where
- [14:59] I can just say like, "Hey, we're trying
- [15:00] to solve this problem. Make sure to look
- [15:02] up at setup.md file to see how we are
- [15:05] trying to tackle this problem." And
- [15:07] then, oh, by the way, this other
- [15:08] reference project solves the exact
- [15:10] thing. And then as soon as I'm done
- [15:11] talking and rambling, which is totally
- [15:13] fine to do, like you can ramble, it's
- [15:15] totally fine. the AI will just put that
- [15:18] in as context and boom, it'll work on
- [15:20] solving it and it's hooked up to cursor
- [15:22] so it knows whenever you call out a
- [15:23] file, oh, I need to include that file.
- [15:25] So, this thing is just insane. Now, if
- [15:28] you want to do poor man's version of
- [15:29] Whisper Flow, totally understand. I have
- [15:31] a cool thing I want to show you. If
- [15:32] you're on Mac, what you can do, you can
- [15:35] actually go over to settings and type in
- [15:37] the word dictation. I wish I could make
- [15:39] this bigger, but for some reason, they
- [15:40] don't let this get bigger. But what you
- [15:42] can also do is update the dictation
- [15:44] shortcut once you turn it on to hit the
- [15:47] right command key twice and you can
- [15:49] actually talk to the computer. So let me
- [15:50] show you what this one looks like cuz
- [15:52] this is also super helpful. So you can
- [15:53] say, "Hey, I'm just trying to show to
- [15:56] YouTube right now how cool it is to use
- [15:58] the dictation tool where you get to use
- [16:00] your Mac and just talk to it completely
- [16:02] for free." And this is automatically
- [16:03] included right out the gate when you're
- [16:05] using Mac OS. So yeah, as you can see,
- [16:07] this is a insanely cool tool. So, if
- [16:09] you're not able to type at 122 words per
- [16:12] minute, you definitely want to consider
- [16:14] using tools like Whisper Flow or
- [16:16] dictation so that you can get all the
- [16:18] ideas out of your head and into the
- [16:19] computer to help solve that context
- [16:21] problem so that these agents can work
- [16:23] their magic. So, yeah, that's tip number
- [16:24] two. So, let's go ahead and hop over to
- [16:26] tip number three. So, the third tip I
- [16:27] want to share with you guys is the
- [16:29] concept of building out an agent
- [16:31] workflow digital twin. Every time I have
- [16:34] shown someone in my free school
- [16:36] community or inside of Shipkit this
- [16:38] concept when they're building out
- [16:39] multi-agent workflows, the light bulb
- [16:41] goes off. They go, "Thank you, Brandon.
- [16:43] I will never build agents the same, and
- [16:46] I'm going to be using this every time
- [16:47] going forward." So, let me explain what
- [16:50] the digital twin concept is and how it
- [16:52] makes building agent workflows a
- [16:54] thousand times easier. So, I think
- [16:55] what's best is to let's cover the
- [16:57] problem first. So the problem is when
- [16:59] we're building out multi- aent
- [17:00] workflows, we're creating a bunch of
- [17:03] different files. So for example, to
- [17:05] build out this workflow right here to
- [17:07] where we have a root agent where our
- [17:09] root agent has sub agents and each sub
- [17:11] agent has, you know, different
- [17:13] callbacks, different tools, they might
- [17:14] access state differently. Well, as we
- [17:16] begin to build more and more complex
- [17:18] workflows, these grow in files. So we
- [17:21] are right now ending up with at least
- [17:23] four different files where if we ever
- [17:26] want to make a change to let's say our
- [17:28] root agent and our root agent changes
- [17:30] the way that it access state. So instead
- [17:32] of writing you know here's the goal
- [17:36] instead of writing the goal it now
- [17:38] writes here is the task. Well every one
- [17:41] of our sub aents that used to be looking
- [17:43] for goal well now it needs to be looking
- [17:45] for task. So, we accidentally just broke
- [17:47] all of our sub aents because as we're
- [17:50] making a change, the AI like cursor for
- [17:52] example is going to go, "Yeah, I I'll
- [17:54] happily update your root agent, but as a
- [17:56] result, we accidentally break everything
- [17:58] downstream." That's the issue. Now, here
- [18:01] is the solution. What we end up doing is
- [18:03] creating a digital twin that is a direct
- [18:06] replica of our actual workflow. So you
- [18:09] can see what we're basically doing is at
- [18:11] a high level we're just creating a
- [18:13] markdown file that says all right our
- [18:15] root agent our root agent has access to
- [18:17] these different sub aents in addition to
- [18:19] having access to those sub aents here's
- [18:21] the tools that it's going to do here's
- [18:23] the overall goal and what
- [18:24] responsibilities this agent does here's
- [18:26] the inputs of the agent here's the
- [18:28] outputs of the agent and we're basically
- [18:29] just replicating what's on the left and
- [18:31] we're putting it into a markdown file.
- [18:32] The reason why this is so helpful is
- [18:35] because anytime we go to actually make a
- [18:37] change like hey your goal now is to not
- [18:40] write the output to be like I said goal
- [18:43] it now should be task well whenever we
- [18:45] go to make the change now and we
- [18:46] actually pass in this markdown file
- [18:48] what's going to happen is our agent's
- [18:50] going to go hey I can see you're trying
- [18:52] to make this change but did you know
- [18:53] you're accidentally breaking the three
- [18:56] other agents that need this as a
- [18:58] required input and you're going to go oh
- [19:01] shoot thank you for telling me that I
- [19:04] will would like you to also go update
- [19:06] these other agents to make sure that
- [19:08] they reflect our change. Now, that's I
- [19:10] promise you the second you start
- [19:11] building digital twins of your agent
- [19:13] workflows, you're going to be like, "Oh
- [19:14] my gosh, this used to be such a pain in
- [19:15] the butt where I'd fix one thing and it
- [19:17] would break four other things." But now
- [19:18] it's working like a charm. So, and
- [19:20] here's exactly what you need to do. You
- [19:21] need to create, like I said, a agent
- [19:24] digital twin. And all this agent digital
- [19:26] twin needs to do is list out at a high
- [19:29] level what each agent does. And every
- [19:31] time you make a change, you're going to
- [19:33] update this file. So this file is going
- [19:35] to include, like I said, the name of the
- [19:36] agents, what they do, what tools,
- [19:37] callbacks, and everything else. And then
- [19:39] outside of that, you also just want to
- [19:41] list like the highlevel overview of what
- [19:44] each like how do all the agents connect.
- [19:46] And you want to just basically keep
- [19:47] replicating everything that's done over
- [19:49] here and actually just replicate it over
- [19:51] in your digital twin. You can definitely
- [19:53] create yourself. It's already included
- [19:54] in Shipkit. But this one change right
- [19:56] here, every person that has started to
- [19:57] create digital twins inside of their own
- [20:00] workflows, they never go back cuz the
- [20:02] second you just it works flawlessly and
- [20:05] you get to move a thousand times faster
- [20:07] and you can build more complex workflows
- [20:09] because everything's stable. And when
- [20:11] you make a change, you know where else
- [20:13] that change is going to cause impacts
- [20:14] downstream and you can fix it down
- [20:16] there, too. So, promise you guys,
- [20:18] digital twin is an absolute cheat code
- [20:20] if you're building out agent workflows.
- [20:22] All right, let's go ahead and hop over
- [20:23] to tip number four. So the fourth tip
- [20:25] that I want to share with you guys is
- [20:26] that you need to train AI to work with
- [20:29] your tech stack. This is one of the
- [20:31] biggest unfair advantages that you could
- [20:33] have to code a thousand times faster
- [20:35] than everyone else because while
- [20:38] everyone else is, you know, working on
- [20:40] implementing a feature and their agents
- [20:41] are adding mistake after mistake after
- [20:43] mistake and they're just going in a
- [20:45] circle saying, "Please AI, stop messing
- [20:47] up. Just build the feature. You're
- [20:49] already on the 10th feature and you're
- [20:50] already done with the project and on to
- [20:52] the next." And the way we're able to do
- [20:54] that is once again by training AI to
- [20:56] work on textX. So let me just give a
- [20:58] quick noob verse pro because I'm hoping
- [21:00] this is going to make sense when we
- [21:01] click it in. But how noobs usually use
- [21:04] these different tools like cursor and
- [21:06] cloud code is they open up a new chat
- [21:08] and they say hey AI please create me a
- [21:10] new ADK agent that's going to make a
- [21:12] tool call to get the weather. Now
- [21:15] they're going to hit enter. They're like
- [21:16] hell yeah I have AI working for me. And
- [21:18] then all of a sudden it's going to come
- [21:20] up with honestly I have no idea what
- [21:22] because ADK was not released in 2024
- [21:26] when the training cut off was for all
- [21:28] these models. So you're basically just
- [21:30] having AI in no man's land trying to do
- [21:32] something it doesn't know how to do. So
- [21:34] it's just going to produce something.
- [21:35] Good luck. I doubt it'll work. So what
- [21:37] we want to do is we want to train AI to
- [21:41] implement and actually know how to work
- [21:44] with our tech stack. And the way we do
- [21:46] that is we create something called a
- [21:47] task template. This is basically just an
- [21:50] expert who knows everything about the
- [21:52] tech stack that we're using. And this
- [21:54] expert is going to generate tasks. So
- [21:56] like if we were thinking about this in
- [21:57] the terms of people, we're basically
- [21:59] having an expert. This expert is going
- [22:01] to produce documents where these
- [22:03] documents provide the exact
- [22:05] step-by-steps instructions on what code
- [22:08] changes need to be made to actually get
- [22:10] the desired functionality that we want
- [22:12] inside of our codebase. So this is the
- [22:14] expert. The expert's going to produce
- [22:16] the task document and the task document
- [22:18] is what's going to be used to implement,
- [22:20] oh, we need to change this file and we
- [22:22] need to change this file. So that's what
- [22:23] we do. Now, how the heck do you make an
- [22:25] AI and train AI to be an expert at it?
- [22:28] Well, it's actually not that hard and
- [22:30] I'll show you an example um right now.
- [22:32] So this is what a task template looks
- [22:35] like. It is nothing more than a list of
- [22:38] instructions on how to use a specific
- [22:41] technology. And ideally what it's trying
- [22:43] to do is take in the desired
- [22:45] functionality that you're trying to
- [22:46] build. It understands the text stack in
- [22:48] and out and all the mistakes to avoid.
- [22:51] And then it's just going to write all of
- [22:53] the functionality to say, "Hey, when
- [22:55] we're trying to add the new feature that
- [22:56] they're asking for." Cool. Yeah, I'll
- [22:58] happily make that task and I'll do it
- [23:00] well cuz I know exactly what to avoid
- [23:02] and what mistakes to not make. And that
- [23:04] way whenever you go to make the code
- [23:05] change, this code change is actually
- [23:06] just going to be perfect. So here's what
- [23:08] it looks like and I'll show you how to
- [23:09] make one yourself in just a second. But
- [23:12] basically this document just contains
- [23:14] all of the common features and
- [23:17] functionalities that we'd want to do.
- [23:18] We've basically standardized writing
- [23:20] code. So what you want to do is you want
- [23:22] to say hey when you're working with ADK
- [23:25] you need to make sure that you can fully
- [23:27] analyze the current project from
- [23:29] beginning to end. So it needs to
- [23:30] understand the structure of an ADK
- [23:32] project which usually starts with a root
- [23:34] agent and a root agent has sub aents. In
- [23:36] addition to that, it has tools. In
- [23:38] addition to that, it has libraries. In
- [23:41] addition to that, like there's a, you
- [23:42] know, it basically just needs to know
- [23:43] the common structure of an ADK
- [23:45] application. From there, it needs to
- [23:46] understand what is what problems we're
- [23:49] actually trying to solve. From there, it
- [23:52] needs to understand some technical
- [23:54] requirements about like what actually
- [23:56] goes into building out ADK applications.
- [23:59] So, it needs to know like, hey, here's
- [24:02] what you should do when you're trying to
- [24:03] add a callback. Here's what are all the
- [24:05] types of callbacks there are. Here's
- [24:07] what you should never do when trying to
- [24:09] add callbacks. And you know, this is
- [24:11] just like a long long document that
- [24:13] describes all the best practices of
- [24:15] working with a specific technology. Now,
- [24:18] they're not that hard to make. And
- [24:19] that's what I want to show you right now
- [24:21] so that you can basically train your own
- [24:23] AI specialist so that when you're trying
- [24:26] to work on a task, you can easily knock
- [24:28] it out. So, here's what we have done.
- [24:30] We're trying to create an ADK task
- [24:32] template. And this is the genius on the
- [24:34] tech stack. And the whole purpose of
- [24:36] this genius is to create task documents.
- [24:39] These task documents once again they
- [24:40] just contain the instructions on how to
- [24:43] update the code. Now so you can see an
- [24:45] example of this. I just made one for you
- [24:48] guys. And let's look at this. So here's
- [24:50] an example of a task where a task just
- [24:53] describes, hey, you're trying to in our
- [24:55] case add the weather like we showed
- [24:57] earlier. So your goal is to do this.
- [24:59] Here's the goal. Now here is what you
- [25:02] need to do. You need to understand the
- [25:03] tool that you're working with, the
- [25:05] models, the different files that exist.
- [25:07] So the current state and basically just
- [25:09] keep going on from there on what changes
- [25:12] need to be made, the current state of
- [25:13] the application and you know it also is
- [25:16] going to include all the instructions
- [25:18] and it's automatically going to do a
- [25:20] good job because it knows not to do A
- [25:21] but it needs to do B. Now here's what
- [25:24] you can do to make your own task
- [25:25] basically your task genius because this
- [25:26] thing is the most important part to help
- [25:28] you go a thousand times faster. So what
- [25:30] you need to do is you need to say and
- [25:32] create a brand new markdown file and say
- [25:35] hey you are a specialist at ADK. Go use
- [25:38] context 7 to learn as much about this
- [25:41] technology as you can and your whole
- [25:43] goal is I'm going to give you an input
- [25:45] of what problem I'm trying to solve. And
- [25:48] your job is to create a task document
- [25:50] that includes all the code changes. And
- [25:52] then what you do is once you have V1 of
- [25:55] this task template set up, you take it
- [25:57] for a run. you take it for a spin and
- [25:58] you say, "Hey, please go add the weather
- [26:01] to this specific agent." And it's going
- [26:03] to come up with a task that looks just
- [26:05] like this to where it's going to go
- [26:07] update the weather. And then you're
- [26:08] going to apply that task and say, "Cool,
- [26:11] I'm going to go update the agent now."
- [26:12] And to start, it's going to fail. It's
- [26:14] going to write garbage code cuz it's
- [26:17] it's learning. And you're going to say,
- [26:18] "Hey, you made this mistake. Never make
- [26:22] this mistake again." Then you're going
- [26:23] to say, "Hey, make sure you add some
- [26:26] instructions in this task template to
- [26:28] avoid this mistake. Here's what you did
- [26:29] wrong. Here's what you should have
- [26:30] done." Then you do it again. And now
- [26:32] it's going to make a new task to add a
- [26:34] new tool to an agent. And you're going
- [26:36] to apply that task again to the code,
- [26:38] and it's going to do better, but it's
- [26:40] going to hit another error. And you're
- [26:41] going to go, "Hey, you actually forgot
- [26:43] to add context to the tool call. So
- [26:46] there was no way for us to save the
- [26:48] state of the weather to global state."
- [26:50] So once again, you made a mistake.
- [26:53] Please, ADK genius expert, never make
- [26:55] this mistake again. Please update your
- [26:58] instructions. And then you're going to
- [26:59] keep going through this over and over
- [27:01] and over again in a feedback loop until
- [27:04] you end up with what I'm calling the
- [27:06] task template that is responsible for
- [27:08] creating the task until this thing can
- [27:09] make task perfectly every time. So
- [27:12] you're going to go through this over and
- [27:13] over and over again. And you want to do
- [27:14] this for every technology stack. You can
- [27:16] do this for ADK, Nex.js, everything. And
- [27:18] eventually what's going to happen is
- [27:20] when you go to implement a new code
- [27:21] change, the task document is going to be
- [27:24] perfect and golden and exactly implement
- [27:26] the exact thing that you want. And it's
- [27:28] going to write perfect code whenever it
- [27:29] comes to actually implementing the
- [27:30] change. And that is what's going to
- [27:32] allow you to just move faster and build
- [27:35] out real functional code way quicker
- [27:37] than everyone else who's constantly
- [27:38] like, "Please AI, please work." And they
- [27:41] wonder why it doesn't work. And it's
- [27:42] because like it was never trained on
- [27:44] their tech stack in the first place. So,
- [27:45] of course, it doesn't have context on
- [27:47] how to solve the problem. So, hopefully
- [27:49] seeing this workflow in action is super
- [27:51] helpful because this is exactly what I
- [27:53] have done every time I go to work on a
- [27:55] new project. It does take some time
- [27:57] upfront to, you know, build out these
- [27:59] types of task templates, but the second
- [28:01] you put up the upfront work of maybe a
- [28:02] few hours, you're going to move faster
- [28:04] for the rest of time. So, I definitely
- [28:06] recommend checking out, you know,
- [28:08] building out your own ADK task
- [28:09] templates. If you have questions, always
- [28:11] feel free to drop into a free school
- [28:12] community. I'd be happy to go deeper
- [28:14] with this with you guys. So you can make
- [28:15] your own or we always have these in
- [28:17] shipkit so you can grab them there too.
- [28:18] But yeah, thanks guys and we're going to
- [28:19] go ahead and head over to test number
- [28:21] five which is where we really put some
- [28:23] gas on to cranking out code a thousand
- [28:25] times faster. And I'm excited to show
- [28:27] you this next one as well. All right, so
- [28:28] the fifth tip that I wanted to share
- [28:30] with you guys is that you should be
- [28:32] doing parallel AI development to move as
- [28:35] fast as possible in building out your AI
- [28:38] projects. Now what does this actually
- [28:39] mean? Well, it means inside of tools
- [28:43] like cursor, cloud code, windsurf, you
- [28:45] should be opening up multiple tabs at
- [28:47] the same time to work on different
- [28:50] features at the same time. And what this
- [28:52] means is, you know, we're going to kick
- [28:53] off this job right here. While that
- [28:55] guy's working, we're going to trigger
- [28:57] off this one. While that one's working,
- [28:58] then we're going to trigger off this
- [29:00] one. So, we basically have multiple
- [29:01] tasks running at the same time to start
- [29:03] building out our application. And by
- [29:05] implementing this, we are going to go so
- [29:07] fast it feels like cheating. Now, what
- [29:10] does this like? How do you do this in
- [29:11] practice? And why should we be doing
- [29:12] this? Let's go why first. Well, if you
- [29:15] were at a corporate company and let's
- [29:17] imagine you are the boss. Well, if you
- [29:20] had literally unlimited employees, it
- [29:23] would be silly to say, I'm only going to
- [29:26] allow employee number one to make code
- [29:28] changes. That's it. He's the only
- [29:30] employee that's allowed to make code
- [29:31] changes, and I'm going to wait for this
- [29:33] employee or intern to get back to me
- [29:35] before I do anything else. Like it would
- [29:37] be silly to build out an application
- [29:39] literally just one small feature after
- [29:41] another. Especially when most of the
- [29:43] time when building out applications
- [29:45] there's some stuff that you could make
- [29:47] changes to on the front end while at the
- [29:49] same time you could also probably make
- [29:51] some changes to the backend for another
- [29:52] feature or a new bug fix. Or if there's
- [29:55] multiple pages of your application,
- [29:57] there's nothing stopping you from
- [29:58] working on this page and this page at
- [30:01] the same time. Or if you're doing agent
- [30:03] development, there's nothing stopping
- [30:04] you from working on agent one. And while
- [30:06] that's taking 1 to 3 minutes to
- [30:08] implement, there's nothing stopping you
- [30:10] from working on agent two at the same
- [30:11] time to where you are like the main
- [30:14] concept I'm trying to get across here is
- [30:16] like you are the boss and there's the
- [30:19] best way to be working is to think about
- [30:21] it this way to where you are saying hey
- [30:23] intern one you know it is your job to go
- [30:26] work on this task. I know you're going
- [30:28] to need some time so go off and do it.
- [30:30] While you're working on that, I'm going
- [30:31] to call in another intern. And this
- [30:34] other intern is going to work on the
- [30:35] next feature. And I'm just going to
- [30:37] continually do this over and over again
- [30:39] for as many features as I can handle in
- [30:42] parallel. Like what's crazy is the
- [30:44] bottleneck in this workflow is us. It's
- [30:47] how many tasks we can, you know, keep up
- [30:49] with in our heads at the same time. So
- [30:51] like you'll see me in the bake off to
- [30:53] where I'm saying like you'll see this
- [30:55] throughout the episodes where I'm like,
- [30:56] "Hey, go make this change on the front
- [30:57] end." Oh, okay. Agent two, it's doing
- [31:00] this wrong. It should be doing this.
- [31:01] Okay, cool. For some reason, something's
- [31:03] going wrong when it comes to our login
- [31:05] page before we can go to the
- [31:06] application, work on this. And I'll
- [31:08] literally do this in parallel. I'll have
- [31:09] like five or six tabs working at the
- [31:11] same time. And then as soon as I'm done,
- [31:13] you know, looking at the task, cuz
- [31:14] that's the kicker. The intern does the
- [31:16] work and reports back to us the code
- [31:18] change and we quickly sign off on that
- [31:20] code change and then kick it off to the
- [31:22] next thing or we say, "Go make this
- [31:24] change." So we're constantly in in a new
- [31:28] paradigm as an AI developer. We're
- [31:30] providing context saying go work on this
- [31:32] and reviewing. Those are our two jobs.
- [31:34] Context and review. And you know to
- [31:37] review obviously you kind of need to
- [31:38] know a little bit about like the tech
- [31:40] stack and what's good code, what's
- [31:41] what's not good code. And you need to
- [31:43] understand like is this the actual
- [31:45] desired functionality and were any
- [31:47] mistakes made? But as long as you can
- [31:49] just quickly review these code changes,
- [31:51] you can work on many tasks in parallel.
- [31:53] and our brains in the amount of
- [31:55] different tasks we can handle, we become
- [31:57] the bottleneck. But what's crazy though
- [31:59] is we're working on four tasks at the
- [32:01] same time. So like truthfully me, I do
- [32:03] this all the time now. I feel like I'm
- [32:05] entering the matrix when I'm doing this,
- [32:06] but I'm getting a week's worth of work
- [32:09] done in a day by following this because
- [32:12] I'm doing five things at the same time.
- [32:14] So this is it's just a mind-blowing tip
- [32:17] and I cannot recommend you guys enough
- [32:18] to do this. And so basically when you
- [32:20] kind of start stacking everything that
- [32:22] we've talked about today on top of each
- [32:23] other, you guys are going to be
- [32:25] unstoppable. So, you know, when you guys
- [32:27] are using Whisper Flow to actually talk
- [32:31] to your computer, you're going to be
- [32:33] typing faster. So, you know, in this
- [32:35] case, you're going to be typing at, you
- [32:36] know, 122 words per minute. Also, you're
- [32:38] going to be using in your own case,
- [32:41] you're going to be using task templates,
- [32:44] which are specialist at implementing
- [32:46] code. So these task templates are going
- [32:48] to make sure that you write quality code
- [32:50] to implement the desired feature. So
- [32:52] you're going to be inputting stuff
- [32:53] faster to the computer. When the agents
- [32:56] are working, they're going to be doing
- [32:57] better work. In addition to that, you
- [32:59] guys are also going to be working in
- [33:01] parallel at the same time on multiple
- [33:03] different tasks. So you're like
- [33:06] multiplying your efforts as well. And
- [33:08] these just all stack on top of each
- [33:10] other one at a time. And when you are
- [33:13] working on task, you also have a ton of
- [33:15] AI reference projects that basically
- [33:18] call out exactly the desired
- [33:20] functionality that you wanted in the
- [33:22] first place. So between the task
- [33:24] templates and the reference projects, my
- [33:26] god, you guys are going to be moving so
- [33:27] fast. So this is one of the ways to
- [33:29] where I was able to in the bake off was
- [33:31] one of the only people that was able to
- [33:33] actually build and complete everything
- [33:36] in the 5-hour allocation and have a
- [33:38] working project to show at the end of
- [33:39] it. And the only way I was able to get
- [33:41] it done is to follow these exact
- [33:43] strategies that I've been sharing with
- [33:44] you guys today. So, I'm hoping you've
- [33:46] had the light bulb moment and you're
- [33:48] like, man, I want to implement these so
- [33:50] bad. And I think the best way to get
- [33:52] started, like I said, I have the free
- [33:53] school community. I would hop over. We
- [33:55] have weekly free coaching calls every
- [33:57] Tuesday at 600 p.m. Eastern time. Would
- [34:00] love to help you guys. If you have any
- [34:01] questions on any of this, walk you
- [34:03] through exactly how you can use some of
- [34:05] this inside of your own applications and
- [34:07] your own workflows. Super happy to help.
- [34:09] and we have a ton of awesome other AI
- [34:11] developers on the call. So, I think
- [34:12] you'll really like to get to meet a lot
- [34:14] of developers who are on the same
- [34:15] journey because we're all learning and
- [34:17] getting better at the same time. But
- [34:18] yeah, that is the five tips that I think
- [34:20] you guys should definitely be
- [34:21] implementing to help you build a
- [34:23] thousand times faster when trying to
- [34:25] crank out real world AI projects. So, I
- [34:27] hoped you guys enjoyed seeing all the
- [34:29] behindthe-scenes tools, tips, and tricks
- [34:31] on how I was able to crank out the
- [34:34] projects for the ADK agent bake off and
- [34:37] was able to win the whole thing. I had
- [34:39] an absolute amazing time. Shout out to
- [34:41] Google for hosting such an amazing
- [34:42] event. And quick reminders, you can
- [34:44] download all the source code for the
- [34:46] completed project that I did at the bake
- [34:48] off completely for free. Just click the
- [34:50] link down description below. You can
- [34:52] also I have a ton of 80K related content
- [34:55] right here on this channel. everything
- [34:56] from an ADK master class, do some deep
- [34:59] dives into voice agents, rag agents, so
- [35:01] many other tips and tricks on ADK. So, I
- [35:04] definitely recommend checking out those
- [35:05] on the channel. And I also recommend you
- [35:08] checking out the school community I have
- [35:10] for you guys where you get to hop on
- [35:11] weekly coaching calls with me and a
- [35:14] bunch of other AI developers on
- [35:16] everyone's on their own journey. We all
- [35:17] work together to help make sure
- [35:19] everyone's making progress. And if you
- [35:20] want to jumpstart your AI development
- [35:22] journey, I cannot recommend enough for
- [35:24] you guys to check out Shipkit where
- [35:26] you're going to get access to all sorts
- [35:28] of pre-built AI projects so that you can
- [35:30] implement a lot of the different
- [35:32] features we talked about and tips in
- [35:34] today's video. And if you have any
- [35:36] questions on it, feel free to always
- [35:37] shoot me an email at brandon@shipkit.ai.
- [35:40] But enough of that. Let's go ahead and I
- [35:42] recommend you checking out whichever
- [35:43] video is popping up on the screen right
