- [00:00] On this channel, I have showcased both
- [00:02] of Google's incredible AI coding agents.
- [00:04] Stitch, which is an incredible UI and UX
- [00:07] design tool that can easily build out
- [00:10] front-end code for your mobile and web
- [00:12] apps, as well as Jules, the asynchronous
- [00:15] coding agent. It's an agentic coding
- [00:17] assistant that can basically read your
- [00:19] entire project context and autonomously
- [00:22] write test, fix bugs, as well as build
- [00:25] features for you. Now, what if I was to
- [00:27] tell you that there is a new way for you
- [00:29] to combine both of these capabilities
- [00:31] into one streamlined pipeline? You can
- [00:34] use Stitch to generate your front-end
- [00:35] code and complete the backend with
- [00:38] Jules, which takes over the logic, the
- [00:41] integrations, the testing, as well as
- [00:44] the debugging process so that you can
- [00:45] push your product to production. This is
- [00:48] shaping up to be a fullon AI software
- [00:51] assembly line and it's something that
- [00:53] you can easily get started with
- [00:54] completely for free which is the best
- [00:56] thing associated with these two
- [00:58] streamlined together [music] and I kid
- [01:00] you not it's super easy. For example,
- [01:02] this is an Airbnb clone that I had
- [01:04] created with Stitch. It created all the
- [01:06] components based off of the image that I
- [01:08] had provided. I simply got this off of
- [01:11] Google images and I told it to replicate
- [01:13] it and it was able to do a great job in
- [01:15] replicating all the components. Now the
- [01:18] great thing is is that the code is
- [01:19] available for the front end. But say if
- [01:22] I want to create the back end. Now what
- [01:23] we can do is click on these three dots
- [01:25] and you can export this to Jules. If you
- [01:27] click on this you have the ability to
- [01:29] directly integrate it into Jules where
- [01:31] you can select the repository that you
- [01:33] want to work within and you can help
- [01:35] build the components out like the
- [01:37] backend structure, the logic or even
- [01:40] debug certain components that you wanted
- [01:42] to iterate on further. This is the
- [01:44] capability of Stitch and Jules with this
- [01:46] new feature to streamline the process of
- [01:49] building full stack apps. And like I
- [01:51] said, you can also export this as a zip
- [01:54] file. And you may ask, why would you do
- [01:55] this? Well, you can use that zip file
- [01:58] within Google AI studio build mode,
- [02:00] which is another AI coding agent. This
- [02:03] won't perform as good as Jules, but you
- [02:06] can use the limits over here to build
- [02:09] out any sort of integration backing
- [02:11] component by simply attaching the file
- [02:13] and then describing what you want it to
- [02:15] build on. But by having jewels and
- [02:18] stitch combined, you're going to be able
- [02:19] to get some incredible outputs. This is
- [02:22] not something that you would expect from
- [02:24] any sort of AI model. You can see that
- [02:26] there isn't just a front end that was
- [02:28] generated. It has backend components
- [02:30] that was also integrated into this app.
- [02:33] But before we dive in, let me introduce
- [02:35] today's video sponsor, Scalekit. The O
- [02:38] stack built specifically for AI
- [02:40] applications. If you're building a B2B
- [02:43] AI product, authentication can get
- [02:45] messy. Scalekit gives you complete O
- [02:49] infrastructure where you can
- [02:50] authenticate AI agents, secure your MCP
- [02:53] servers and APIs with the drop-in oath
- [02:57] layer and protect human users with a
- [02:59] passwordless flow [music] like magic
- [03:01] links or pass keys or go upmarket with
- [03:04] enterprise SSO and scrim. And here's the
- [03:07] kicker. You don't have to switch your
- [03:09] entire O provider already on O0 or an
- [03:12] open- source solution. Well, no problem.
- [03:15] Scale Kit's modular design lets you add
- [03:17] enterprise level identity or Asian
- [03:20] identity features without rewriting your
- [03:22] stack. That flexibility is really their
- [03:24] secret sauce. So, if you want to secure
- [03:27] every layer of your AI app and scale
- [03:30] without headaches, take a look at Scale
- [03:32] Kit with the link in the description
- [03:34] below and start building smarter
- [03:36] authentication today. To get started,
- [03:38] you can easily go ahead and create an
- [03:40] account completely for free as long as
- [03:42] you have a Google account with both
- [03:44] Jules as well as Stitch. But now we can
- [03:46] use Stitch its AI coding capabilities to
- [03:49] fully generate the UI components for our
- [03:52] front end of our project. We can simply
- [03:54] describe what we wanted to build,
- [03:55] whether it's an app or a web app, and we
- [03:58] can have it designed in the experimental
- [04:00] mode or the standard mode. The
- [04:02] experimental mode will use the Gemini
- [04:04] 2.5 Pro fully free to develop any sort
- [04:07] of UI component that you describe. You
- [04:09] just need to simply describe it in
- [04:11] natural language. You can even upload
- [04:12] wireframes, mockups, as well as sketches
- [04:15] for it to reference and build out. In
- [04:17] this case, what I want Stitch to work on
- [04:19] is building out all the components of a
- [04:21] crypto trading platform. I'm telling it
- [04:24] to basically develop the UI components
- [04:26] like the real-time order book, the live
- [04:28] price feed, the candlestick chart, and a
- [04:31] lot more. And I'm adding this chart over
- [04:33] here, which I found off of Google, and
- [04:36] I'm going to be requesting it to mimic
- [04:37] it. So now, what we can do is send in
- [04:40] this prompt, and it is going to be
- [04:41] executed by the Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's
- [04:44] going to first start off by planning out
- [04:46] all the steps as to how it will tackle
- [04:48] it. And within the canvas, it's going to
- [04:50] display all the components that it will
- [04:52] generate.
- [04:53] And there we go. I kid you not, in 40
- [04:56] seconds, it was able to develop this
- [04:58] crypto trading exchange that mimics the
- [05:01] photo that I had provided. And it did a
- [05:03] great job in adding all the components
- [05:05] that we had requested like the live
- [05:08] chart, the candlestick chart. You also
- [05:10] have the order book which is being
- [05:12] displayed. And it did a great job in
- [05:14] structuring it like how we wanted it to
- [05:16] structure based off the wireframe. And
- [05:19] now what you can also do is iterate on
- [05:21] this further by requesting other
- [05:22] details. You can even generate multiple
- [05:25] options as well. So if you click on this
- [05:27] button, you can generate more options of
- [05:29] this so that you can get different
- [05:31] variants for it to code out. And I did
- [05:33] that right now. I have select three
- [05:35] variants for it to actually generate.
- [05:37] and it will generate three more of these
- [05:39] copies in different formats and
- [05:41] different uh components within this
- [05:43] canvas. And you also have the ability to
- [05:45] annotate to edit. So if you click on
- [05:47] this, you can select a certain component
- [05:49] for it to iterate on further. You also
- [05:52] have the ability to adjust the theme. So
- [05:54] if there's a particular theme that you
- [05:55] want to change it to, like green, you
- [05:57] can do that. You can change it to light
- [05:59] mode. You can also generate multiple
- [06:01] copies directly from the canvas. And you
- [06:04] can even regenerate it, download it, and
- [06:06] then actually view the code that was
- [06:08] actually generated. You can export this
- [06:10] to Figma as well, which is a capability
- [06:12] that Stitch provides. And all of this is
- [06:14] being accomplished fully free. And I
- [06:17] will say it's not the best generation
- [06:19] with these new variants. Like you see
- [06:20] over here, this does not look like a
- [06:22] full-on crypto exchange. Uh the gradient
- [06:25] doesn't make sense at all over here. But
- [06:27] in this case, the formatting is not
- [06:29] correct with this trading dashboard. But
- [06:31] the last one that we've got looks pretty
- [06:33] good. And in my opinion, these two
- [06:35] options look the best. I personally
- [06:37] would like to go forward with this due
- [06:39] to the structure. And we can tell the
- [06:41] jewels agent to actually fix all the
- [06:43] components that are messed up in this
- [06:45] case. So now what we can do is if we
- [06:48] highlight this canvas itself by clicking
- [06:50] on the select button, you can then click
- [06:53] on these three dots. And what you can
- [06:54] also do is you can attach multiple
- [06:56] variants. So if I want to select both of
- [06:59] them, you can click on shift and then
- [07:01] you can click on these three dots and
- [07:02] you can export it to jewels. In this
- [07:04] case, what we can say is we can describe
- [07:07] it to build on further for this crypto
- [07:10] exchange. This is where I can describe
- [07:12] jewels to basically focus on the next
- [07:14] component where I wanted to build out
- [07:16] the back end and I wanted to polish
- [07:18] these components for the front end. I
- [07:20] wanted to also fix and expand the app
- [07:23] itself. And obviously if there's a
- [07:25] component issue that you want to fix,
- [07:26] you can iterate within Stitch, but I'm
- [07:28] going to have Jules now work on the next
- [07:30] component which will work on building
- [07:32] out the overall task. Now I'm going to
- [07:34] choose a repository for it to work on.
- [07:36] And then once you're ready, you can then
- [07:38] go ahead and click on create task. And
- [07:40] you can see now it is working on
- [07:42] tackling the backend task where it's
- [07:44] going to fully code out every component
- [07:46] so that our app is fully functional. And
- [07:49] thanks to Stitch developing the
- [07:51] front-end components, it will now work
- [07:53] on building out the backend components
- [07:55] and making sure that it is going to be
- [07:57] able to connect perfectly with the front
- [07:59] end. And there we go. We now have it so
- [08:01] that Jules is now working on the backend
- [08:04] component of building out our crypto
- [08:06] exchange. You can see it is working on
- [08:08] the plan process. And once you approve
- [08:10] this plan, you can click on the plan
- [08:12] approved button which will start working
- [08:14] on executing this task. And you can see
- [08:17] now it is working on tackling the
- [08:19] backend task where it's going to fully
- [08:21] code out every component so that our app
- [08:23] is fully functional. And thanks to
- [08:25] Stitch developing the front-end
- [08:27] components, it will now work on building
- [08:29] out the backend components and making
- [08:31] sure that it is going to be able to
- [08:33] connect perfectly with the front end.
- [08:37] And there we go guys. I have finally
- [08:39] opened up whatever it had created. and
- [08:42] it was able to fully develop this with
- [08:44] the live order book which you see on the
- [08:46] left hand side and it made sure all the
- [08:48] components are functional just how we
- [08:50] had requested it to be. It added all of
- [08:53] the positions which we saw within that
- [08:56] image. It was able to fully build the
- [08:58] live trades being placed. You can also
- [09:00] even place down any sort of limit order
- [09:03] or even a market order if needed by
- [09:05] pressing the buy long or short button.
- [09:08] But essentially, it was able to fully
- [09:10] build this out based off of the free
- [09:12] tier that is available with Stitch as
- [09:14] well as with Jules. And this is why I
- [09:17] believe this is one of the best tools
- [09:18] available. If you like this video and
