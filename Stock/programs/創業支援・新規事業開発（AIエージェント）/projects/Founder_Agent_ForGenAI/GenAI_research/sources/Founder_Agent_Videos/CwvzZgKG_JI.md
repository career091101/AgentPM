- [00:00] AI agents are easily one of the most exciting 
parts of AI right now. And they don't just
- [00:05] respond like typical AI chatbots like chat GPT. 
They could actually take actions for you. And
- [00:11] they are getting more powerful every single day. 
My goal with this video is to explain what AI
- [00:16] agents are in the most simple way, even if you're 
completely non-technical. Show you how they work.
- [00:23] Show you what they're used for with practical 
examples. And then we're going to go ahead and
- [00:26] build one from scratch, very step by step. Now, 
you don't need any coding skills to follow along,
- [00:32] and I'm confident by the end of the video, you'll 
not only understand exactly what AI agents are and
- [00:37] what they could do, but you could build your very 
own AI agent. Now, let's get into what AI agents
- [00:42] are first. So, AI agents are a computer program 
that can actually think and reason and act on
- [00:48] their own to complete a task. They're autonomous, 
right? They could actually take steps on their
- [00:54] own. Now, these are totally unlike traditional 
computer programs. those have to follow a very
- [00:59] specific set of instructions that usually someone 
else wrote for them. AI agents could actually
- [01:05] adapt to new information. They could learn from 
experience. They usually have memory and they
- [01:10] could figure out a best way to actually achieve a 
goal. Now, what makes AI agents so different and
- [01:15] so groundbreaking? Well, the best way to break 
it down is by comparing it to the other tools
- [01:21] that are available right now. So, for example, 
let's take chat GPT. Chat GPT will take in a text
- [01:27] prompt your question and it will output an answer, 
right? But it actually can really take actions for
- [01:33] you. It's just a back and forth conversation. 
Very useful, but not an agent. And then there
- [01:39] is something called automation. And there are 
plenty of automation tools that I've used for
- [01:44] many years before AI came out. And those can take 
action, but they have to follow a specific set of
- [01:51] predefined rules. they actually can't reason and 
they can't figure out the best path forward. They
- [01:56] will literally go step by step on rules that you 
have set for them. Those are called automations.
- [02:01] So agents in a way combine all of those things 
and more. So they could have access to the power
- [02:08] of models like chat GPT. They could have access 
to steps and tools that you typically have in
- [02:14] automation tools and they have access to reasoning 
and they have access to memory and they bring it
- [02:19] all together to actually achieve a goal. Okay, let 
me break down how agents actually work in a very
- [02:24] step-by-step way. So the very first step is you 
want to give your agent a goal. So for example,
- [02:31] help answer customer service question. That's the 
role of the agent. The second step is it will go
- [02:36] and gather information that he has access to. So, 
it will look at what's happening in the chat. It
- [02:40] will look at customer messages, any order history, 
and it will put all of that together. Now,
- [02:45] step three, it will make decisions based on what 
it's learned. It will figure out what the next
- [02:50] step is. It will answer questions. It will ask 
for more details if it needs it. It will arrange
- [02:55] a refund. It will actually take that step to 
arrange a refund, for example. So, not only can
- [03:00] it reason and understand what it needs to do next, 
it will actually be able to do that. And that is
- [03:05] step four. It will actually take the action. An 
AI agent does what it thinks is best to hit his
- [03:11] goal and it will literally do those steps to get 
there. Now what makes an AI agent? It typically
- [03:16] has three parts to it. The very first part and the 
core of an AI agent is the AI model it is using in
- [03:23] the background. So you could use models that chat 
GPT uses for example you could use claude Gemini
- [03:28] whatever your favorite large language model is 
that could be the model that is powering your AI
- [03:34] agent. I'll show you when we build one how to pick 
from a list of available large language models.
- [03:40] Now, the second part that makes an AI agent 
useful is the fact that it could have memory. So,
- [03:45] if it remembers past interactions, it will 
actually be able to make good decisions,
- [03:50] right? If it's a back and forth and it forgets the 
conversation after a few chats, then it's not very
- [03:56] useful. It's not really a good AI agent. And third 
are tools. AI agents can use tools to do all kinds
- [04:03] of different things. So, for example, they could 
retrieve data from your Google Drive. They could
- [04:08] go ahead and search the web for you. They could 
send emails using Gmail for you. And they could
- [04:13] chain actions together to get a lot more done than 
just taking one action inside of one app. Now,
- [04:19] one of the ways I actually wrap my head around 
AI agents and what they could actually do is
- [04:24] with a free resource that HubSpot created, which I 
will link in the description below this video, and
- [04:29] it's a perfect companion to this video. It covers 
many of the same core concepts in written format.
- [04:35] So it's really easy to reference later and refresh 
your memory. It's a 42page ebook which goes beyond
- [04:42] what I've covered here with section that break 
down specific use cases across marketing, sales,
- [04:47] and operation with multiple examples in each 
category. Plus, there is a step-by-step guide
- [04:53] on how to build a smart human AI collaboration 
strategy for your business along with common
- [04:58] pitfalls to avoid and best practices to follow. 
And it comes with a second free download called
- [05:03] How to Use AI Agents in 2025. This one's a 
practical checklist you could follow and it
- [05:09] will walk your organization through each phase 
of adoption. It's a hand-on tool to make sure
- [05:14] your implementation is smooth, strategic, and 
effective. And I think the section about common
- [05:19] pitfalls to avoid is worth mentioning because 
I won't have time to get into it in this video,
- [05:23] but it's an important part of understanding how 
to work with AI agent and definitely worth a read.
- [05:28] The entire AI agent playbook is free to download 
using the link in the description. Thank you for
- [05:33] HubSpot for sponsoring this video and making such 
a practical resource available to my audience.
- [05:39] Okay, so what can an AI agent do for you? You 
could build simple AI agents or you could get
- [05:44] much more complex and build what are called multi- 
aent systems. Okay? And I'm going to give you some
- [05:50] ideas here and then we'll go ahead and build one. 
So a very common one that people like to build is
- [05:54] a social media content planner. It will suggest 
and schedule post using automation platforms and
- [06:00] chat bots. Now AI agents for customer service 
is one of the most common ways people are using
- [06:05] AI agents, but they could actually do a lot of 
things for you beyond just answering questions.
- [06:11] So they could obviously answer FAQ questions, but 
they usually could solve issues, too. For example,
- [06:16] they could get connected to Stripe and handle 
billing questions. A lot of different ways to
- [06:20] build those. One of my favorite AI agents is a 
personal email assistant. An agent that could
- [06:26] go categorize and filter all my emails for me, 
get rid of all the spam for me, draft replies
- [06:32] to emails that I need to reply to. Really easy to 
build that with apps like N8N. You could also have
- [06:38] automated lead management agent, right? So, if 
you have a business and you have leads coming in,
- [06:42] you want to track those leads, you want to 
send follow-ups in a timely manner, agents
- [06:46] could take care of that for you. You could have 
an agent that scrapes and summarizes web pages,
- [06:50] right? So, they could go ahead and browse a web 
page, extract all the information and summarize
- [06:55] it for you and make it really organized for you 
and easily accessible. AI marketing agents are
- [07:00] great. These could automate all kinds of content 
creation, social media post, and they will
- [07:05] incorporate AI to actually create something really 
useful and practical. So you're not just posting
- [07:10] noise on these social media platforms. Now, I'll 
also link this page in the description below this
- [07:15] video. So if you want to see over a thousand 
other examples, there is a platform called N8N,
- [07:21] which I'll introduce you to in a second. But they 
have this page right here. If you click on AI,
- [07:26] you'll see all kinds of different examples of what 
AI agents could do. And when you click on any of
- [07:32] them here, it will kind of show you how the AI 
agents is laid out. And if it's free to use, you
- [07:37] could just click here and it will be added with a 
platform called N810, which we'll get into right
- [07:42] now. Okay. Now, let's go ahead and build our very 
own AI agent. And the easiest way I've learned how
- [07:48] to build an AI agent is with a platform called 
N8N. Now, one of the main reasons I like this
- [07:54] is the visual interface. That's my favorite part. 
You could literally drag and drop these things,
- [07:59] move them around, and it's a really nice canvas. 
It also has ton of different integrations.
- [08:04] So when you're building these agents, you use 
tools. And those tools could be your calendar,
- [08:10] you could be Gmail, it could be things you have 
inside of notion, Slack, WhatsApp, any type of
- [08:15] communication tool you use. They typically 
have an integration for it. That's very easy
- [08:20] in plugandplay. And there's more advanced things 
you could do to actually attach these workflows or
- [08:26] these AI agents to things that are not included, 
but they are adding more and more all the time.
- [08:31] So, most likely you will find an integration 
that's easy and plug-andplay. And what's great
- [08:35] is they actually have a free trial right now 
and it's very affordable. It starts at just $20
- [08:40] a month and give you access to a lot of usage 
for that price. And if you're more technical,
- [08:45] this is actually an open-source platform as well. 
So, you could technically install it locally on
- [08:51] your computer and run it. I did make a different 
video about that that is more technical, but the
- [08:56] NHN website is actually really easy to get started 
with. I'll put a link in the description to that
- [09:01] as well. Now, let me quickly show you what we're 
going to build and then we're going to build it
- [09:05] completely from scratch. I'm going to build an AI 
agent that is going to be my personal assistant.
- [09:11] And what it's going to do is it will have access 
to all my calendar events. So, it will know all
- [09:16] the meetings I have coming up. It will access to 
my email. So, it could actually read the emails
- [09:21] and it will tell it exactly which emails for it to 
read. It's going to be just the emails I'm getting
- [09:26] from clients. And then it's going to be able to 
send me an email telling me a proposal for a time
- [09:32] for a meeting based on everything I have going on. 
Now, this is just one example of an AI agent. So,
- [09:38] if you're not using this exact same one, the 
building blocks of this one will be relevant to
- [09:44] a lot of different agents that you'll build. So, 
even if you don't build this exact same one, which
- [09:49] I think is going to be very applicable for you, 
too. But if you don't build the same one or don't
- [09:52] need the same one, you'll see that a lot of the 
building blocks will work through every AI agent
- [09:57] that you'll build. Okay, I just made this full 
screen and I'll make a new AI workflow AI agent
- [10:02] here step by step. I'll just create a new one. 
And inside of your AI agent, this is what you're
- [10:08] going to see. It says click here to add your first 
step. And there's lots of different ways where an
- [10:13] AI agent could start. So a very common one, for 
example, is trigger manually. You have to click
- [10:19] on something to start the AI agent from actually 
activating. On a schedule is one of my favorites
- [10:25] because maybe every single day at a certain time 
you could go ahead and create something. And this
- [10:31] is the one I'm going to use actually for this one. 
And another very common one is on a chat message.
- [10:36] So it will actually work like chat GPT. You give 
it a message, but it will have everything that
- [10:42] you set up after that message and it will initiate 
that way. So for this one here, I could choose on
- [10:48] a schedule like this one right here. And it could 
be set based on days, minutes, seconds, weeks,
- [10:54] or months. And then this will be every single day. 
And it could run at midnight, for example. Or in
- [10:59] this case, it will make sense to run at 10:00 a.m. 
And if I just click away, that schedule is set.
- [11:05] Okay, so that's your very first step. You decide 
how you want to trigger it. You could actually
- [11:09] add multiple different triggers. So I'll show 
you that in a bit. Then I'm going to press the
- [11:13] plus sign here. Now the next one is we need to 
add an AI agent. So if you check for AI agent,
- [11:19] this is the one we want. And let me just click 
away just to show you what the AI agent looks
- [11:23] like. The AI agent will have access to a chat 
model. That's the AI model that we're going to
- [11:29] give it access to. It will have access to memory. 
We could actually change this how much memory it
- [11:34] has access to. Obviously long enough for it to 
remember a chat if you were using it for customer
- [11:40] service, for example. And ton of different tools. 
And this platform, N8N, has access to hundreds of
- [11:47] different tools that you could tap into pretty 
much just about every tool you use will be one
- [11:52] of these integrations here. So, we're going to go 
ahead and add those three here. Okay. So, let me
- [11:56] click back on it here because I clicked away. This 
is the initial page that you typically get. And
- [12:02] all you have to do over here is you have to decide 
how this is going to work. So, source for prompt,
- [12:08] this is your user message. It could be based on a 
chat. So if you use the trigger to be a chat like
- [12:14] how a chat GPT conversation starts you could 
choose that or you could choose define below
- [12:18] and with define below you just give it a system 
prompt that will go over here. So this is how
- [12:24] you want the chatbot to actually behave. This 
is kind of an important part when you go ahead
- [12:30] and set these up. So let me go ahead and paste 
one over here to show you how that goes. Now,
- [12:35] I'll briefly walk you through these, but one of 
the best ways to get these type of prompts is just
- [12:40] to explain what you're trying to do with chat GPT 
and ask it to give you a system prompt here that
- [12:46] you could add inside of N8N. And all I did was 
I said you are a client status assistant. And I
- [12:52] could even describe more about what it does, but 
I described in detail what it could actually have
- [12:57] access to. So these are the different tools like 
my calendar, list every meeting, find every free
- [13:02] slot and so on. And then I give it steps. So call 
the get event tools and then call the get client
- [13:11] tools. So those are the couple of tools that we're 
going to set up in a little bit here. So I just
- [13:15] jumped ahead, but again, chat GPT could help you 
come up with something like this. And you could
- [13:20] just manually type in exactly what you're looking 
for and have chat GPT actually flush it out. Just
- [13:26] tell chat GPT to give you a better system prompt 
from the one you have. And I like to say build
- [13:31] an HTML email with the sections. And this will 
all make more sense here as we build it out. So
- [13:36] typically you could come back and add this in 
a little bit after you know all the different
- [13:41] tools that you're going to add to it. But it is 
a system prompt that is required. Without it,
- [13:46] it's not going to do a good job at all. Okay. 
Now, if I click away, the next thing we want
- [13:50] to do is we want to add a chat model. Right? So 
the first step was just clicking over here and
- [13:55] setting that prompt for us. Now the chat model, we 
have lots of them available to us. So for example,
- [14:02] OpenAI is obviously the most popular one. So you 
could choose that one here and then you could
- [14:07] choose the different types of large language model 
that comes from OpenAI. So if you want the default
- [14:13] one that chat GPT uses for example, right now 
is GPT 40 latest. If five comes out, it might be
- [14:19] that one by the time you watch this video. And if 
you want a more cost effective one, the mini one,
- [14:25] this one right here, 40 mini, this is the most 
cost effective one. So I'm going to choose that
- [14:30] one right over here. And over here, you'll have 
to add your credentials. And this basically lets
- [14:36] you find out where you get something called 
an API key. If you're not familiar with this,
- [14:41] this is something you get directly from OpenAI. So 
then you could actually use OpenAI's chat models.
- [14:48] This is not your regular chat GPT account that 
you need in order to do this. So if you Google
- [14:54] open AAI API, it will usually give you a link 
to this page right here. And this page will let
- [15:00] you log in and get an API key. So once you log 
in, if you go to the dashboard page right here,
- [15:06] there is something right here on the left side, 
API key. And then you will go ahead and create
- [15:11] a new secret key over here. give it a name and it 
will create you a key which you will only be able
- [15:16] to see one time and then you will take the key 
right here. Copy that key number. Don't show this
- [15:21] to anyone because anyone that has this key will 
be able to access your API and the API will need
- [15:29] a credit card attached to it and it will charge 
you based on usage and that's why I recommended
- [15:33] a cheap model there. And then you paste that over 
here like this and then you could go ahead and
- [15:37] save it from on top. Okay. So, so far inside of 
our AI agent, we double cllicked over here. And
- [15:43] inside of our AI agent, we gave it a prompt. 
So, that was the first step. The second step
- [15:48] was we added a chat model. Again, there's a lot of 
them available. And if I double click over here,
- [15:53] we chose a model from OpenAI, but you could use 
Gemini, you could use Claude, you could use Llama,
- [15:59] all kinds of different models you could add here. 
The next thing we need to add is a memory. So,
- [16:04] let me press plus here. And this simple memory is 
really easy to get started with, but they do have
- [16:09] more complex memory options available. But if you 
search for simple memory here, this one's pretty
- [16:15] straightforward. All you have to do is decide how 
long of the conversation you want it to remember.
- [16:20] So how many past interactions the model receives 
as the context. The context is how much from the
- [16:26] input and output it remembers. By default, it's 
set to five. Now, for what I'm using this for,
- [16:32] that's enough. But if you're using it for like a 
customer service chatbot, you want something much
- [16:36] higher than that. Maybe 25, right? But in this 
case, five is good because I'm using it as an
- [16:42] assistant. And it doesn't need to remember a long 
conversation. Now, by the way, from time to time,
- [16:46] it's good to just save this right here. This 
will save everything you've done. And you'll
- [16:50] see it says saved. So every time you make a new 
adjustment, this turns red. So you could save your
- [16:54] workflow so you don't lose anything. And this is 
a nice visual layout here. So you could organize
- [17:00] things nicely that way. Okay. Now this is the 
most important part of the whole process. This
- [17:05] becomes an AI agent when it gets access to tools. 
So it could actually do things for us, right? So
- [17:12] it has AI accessible here through OpenAI. It 
does have memory, but it also needs tools. So
- [17:18] if I press plus on tools, you'll see that this 
has access to ton of different tools. These are
- [17:24] just really popular apps that you probably use 
already where all your information sits on. And
- [17:30] one of the best ones right now for what I'm using 
this for is Google calendar. There is a Google
- [17:35] calendar tool. So if I select this, this will pop 
up with this page. Every tool usually has a page
- [17:41] like this where you have to give it access. So the 
first thing I want to do is credential to connect
- [17:48] with. So you want to create new credentials over 
here. And then you will have to connect this to
- [17:53] your Google account where your calendar is. So I'm 
going to do that here. Okay. And it's connected
- [17:58] here to my Google calendar. And that's all I had 
to do. So now I could click away here and this is
- [18:03] now my new Google calendar that I just set it up. 
Now everything else here could seem a little bit
- [18:08] complicated, but it's pretty straightforward. 
It says what calendar do you want to get this
- [18:12] from? So from the list of calendars, I'm going to 
choose one that is my calendar here. And when it
- [18:18] comes to a start and end time, a real simple one 
is you could start with this fixed option right
- [18:23] here and literally choose a date and time. So 
let's say I'll just start it from now. And then
- [18:29] you could set an end date for yourself. And then 
again, this could be based on that type of date.
- [18:34] Change it to fixed. And let's say it's a week 
from now. Now, this is a very beginner way to
- [18:40] do it. Another way to do it is with these things 
called expressions. Now, with expressions, it
- [18:46] gets a little bit more advanced, so I won't really 
go into it in this beginner tutorial. But if you
- [18:51] have set it to expressions, if you type in these 
double brackets like this, you could do something
- [18:57] like now. Okay? And this is always changing. This 
is why it's an expression, not a fixed thing. So,
- [19:04] you could do now. And then over here, if I change 
it to expression, it will be now plus one hour
- [19:10] from now. Right? So, this is one hour from now. 
Or I could do one week from now for example. So
- [19:16] instead of hours I could put week and this will 
become one week from now. Right? It gets more
- [19:21] complicated. So you could start with everything 
that is fixed and then over time as you get more
- [19:26] advanced you could learn about expressions and 
you could always ask chat GPT to give you N8N
- [19:32] expressions and it will give you these where 
you could just type them paste those into these
- [19:37] boxes. And then I'm going to change one last thing 
over here for operation. I don't want to create a
- [19:42] calendar. I actually want to get many events. So 
retrieves many events from a calendar. I wanted to
- [19:48] check every day what things I have on my calendar. 
So get many is what I want. And then everything
- [19:53] else is set up. So just to recap, you connect your 
Google calendar here. Then you go ahead and change
- [19:59] this to get many. Choose the right calendar here. 
And then down over here, you want to make sure
- [20:05] that you change this to after right now. So that 
would be the time based on fixed or expression
- [20:11] looks like exactly like this. And then before 
would be one week from now. So that's how I set
- [20:16] that or you could set a fixed date here if you're 
not going to want to change this all the time.
- [20:21] And I'm going to rightclick on this and I'm going 
to rename this. Okay. I'm going to call this get
- [20:25] events tool. That way when I actually describe 
in the system prompt what I want, I could use
- [20:31] this exact name instead of Google calendar tool. 
both would work, but this tells me exactly what
- [20:38] I'm trying to do here, and it's easier for me, 
especially when you add a lot of different tools
- [20:43] and when you stack agents on top of agents. 
I like to just simplify it this way. Now,
- [20:49] we're going to add another tool. This time, we're 
going to ask it to go and read our Gmail. So,
- [20:54] the Gmail tool is what we want. And same kind of 
thing. We want to link it up to our Gmail. So,
- [20:59] it worked the same way as before. You create 
credentials. It already knows my Google. Now
- [21:04] with this one, I do need to change the operation 
again. I want to get many. So that will get many
- [21:09] emails from my email inbox. And I have limited to 
50 right now because this will work every single
- [21:15] week. But you can increase this limit as well. 
And under filters, this is how I actually want
- [21:20] to do it. I want to do it based on label names. 
And I'll explain this in a second. Right now,
- [21:25] if I choose label names, it's going to see all the 
different labels I have in my Gmail account. So
- [21:31] the one I want is clients. Okay. And I'm going to 
set it to that and I could exit out of that. Now,
- [21:37] let me open up my Gmail to show you why that's 
working the way I want. Now, what I've done
- [21:42] inside of my Gmail here is I've created a label 
which you could create just pressing the plus
- [21:47] sign and creating a label and then selecting any 
email and putting it inside of that label. Now,
- [21:53] they also have an automation in Gmail. So, for 
example, if you wanted to do it in the settings,
- [21:58] if you go to all settings, they have this options 
for filters, and you could actually type in your
- [22:02] client emails here and create a filter and create 
an automated rule. So, they all get that client's
- [22:09] email copy. So, they'll just directly go over 
here. You don't have to manually do it. So,
- [22:14] that's how I set it up. That's on the Gmail side. 
Or you could just manually tag everything with
- [22:19] this client's email and then pick things that 
way. So that's why when I go to my Gmail, I had
- [22:25] that label by email. All my client emails directly 
get that label here. Right now I'm using a test
- [22:31] account, but that works in my regular account as 
well. Now I'm going to go ahead and right click
- [22:35] on this one too and I'm going to rename this get 
client email tool so it stays consistent when I
- [22:44] use the system instruction. They all have similar 
names. Now, as I mentioned in the beginning, you
- [22:48] could actually have different types of triggers 
in the beginning. So, I'm going to go ahead and
- [22:52] click this little section right over here because 
I want to add another trigger just to show you
- [22:58] that you could add multiple triggers. So, this is 
set to a schedule, but for the sake of this video,
- [23:02] I'm going to trigger this manually. So, I could do 
a test, right? So, I'm going to move this up here.
- [23:06] I'm not going to wait till tomorrow. And right 
over here, if you drag this, you could connect it
- [23:11] to the AI agent like this, right? So, your trigger 
could happen right when you click this, right? And
- [23:17] you could test the workflow that way or you could 
trigger based on that schedule or based on chat.
- [23:22] Number of different ways the triggers could start 
and you could have multiple stacked on top of each
- [23:26] other. And let me go ahead and save this right 
now. Just remember to save every time you add
- [23:30] something. Now I'm going to add one more tool over 
here. So this is going to be a Gmail tool again.
- [23:35] So I'll check for the Gmail tool one more time. 
But this time I'm going to have it send. So before
- [23:41] we got the emails so it could read the emails, but 
now we're going to send an email to ourselves. Now
- [23:46] the subject line again you could set it to fix 
so it's always the same thing. You could use
- [23:50] expressions or you could just select this option 
right here. Let the model define the parameter so
- [23:57] the AI will decide what the subject line is for 
us. And I'm going to do the same thing. The email
- [24:02] type is HTML so it could be formatted nicely. 
And I'm going to choose this option again for
- [24:06] the actual message. Okay. So that's the next one. 
And again I made sure I linked my Gmail account.
- [24:13] So I'm going to choose that over here too. And 
I'll move that down here. And I'll rename this
- [24:18] one over here. Send update message tool. Okay, 
now we have everything set up over here. Let me
- [24:26] save it one more time. We could go ahead and test 
it, right? So to test it, I could just start with
- [24:30] this one that I added. When you click test, I'm 
going to test this flow. And you see it's going to
- [24:35] run through here. And if you get any error message 
here, I specifically set one up here so you could
- [24:40] see what it does. If I double click it, it gave me 
a message that there is an error in the memory how
- [24:47] I set up the memory. So if I click over here, it 
was actually set to connected chat trigger node,
- [24:53] but we didn't have a chat trigger, right? So I 
need to say define below over here and just type
- [24:59] in some text here as a key. So for example, I'll 
just call this daily briefing. And now I'm going
- [25:06] to click away and I'm going to save it. Now that 
should take care of that. So, let's test it one
- [25:11] more time. And now it's going through. The AI 
agent is working. Everything is working. I'm
- [25:16] getting the checkbox. Anytime I don't get the 
checkbox, I'll get this error message here. So,
- [25:21] I'll go ahead and pause this for now. So, you 
could always pause the workflow if you get any
- [25:26] errors. And I'll go ahead and double click to see 
what happened here. And it looks like I had the
- [25:30] wrong email here because I did switch my Google 
accounts and it was stuck on the old email. So,
- [25:35] I did switch that back. Okay. So, we'll go ahead 
and test this one more time from on top. Okay, now
- [25:41] that got the check mark. Everything is getting the 
check mark over here. And soon it should send an
- [25:46] email to me. There we go. We got the check mark. 
Okay, now this is the email that was sent to me,
- [25:52] right? So, it found the three emails, these three 
test emails that we sent to ourselves, which under
- [25:57] the client tab. So, if I go back here, these were 
the three emails. It read through those emails.
- [26:03] Then it checked my calendar which is using Google 
calendar to find out all the different things
- [26:09] I have scheduled in the next week. So these are 
three meetings I already have and then it proposed
- [26:15] a time. This is where it reasons for itself 
to make sure it proposes a time that doesn't
- [26:20] interfere with any of the previous meetings I 
have. So it had to analyze all the previous chats,
- [26:27] bring itself up to date, then check my calendar 
and then reason within itself and then find a time
- [26:34] where I could propose to a client. So now I could 
simply just copy and paste this, draft an email,
- [26:40] which I could also set to be part of that AI agent 
workflow, but right now I just wanted to be more
- [26:45] as a personal assistant that checks all existing 
emails and my calendar and propose a time. And you
- [26:51] see because of that HTML formatting, it gave it 
to me in this really nice format over here. Now,
- [26:56] I'm just going to go back here to show you a lot 
of that happened over here because of this text
- [27:03] over here, which was my prompt. And it's set to be 
user prompt. I'm calling it the system prompt. But
- [27:08] this is the box that it goes under here. And that 
is the behavior that you set for your AI agent to
- [27:15] follow. And you could really flush this out again 
with the help of chat GPT. And if you just want to
- [27:20] pause it right here, I basically told it what type 
of tool it has access to. And then I told it these
- [27:27] are all the different steps I want you to do in 
that order. Right? So it's like step one through
- [27:32] five exactly how we describe the same steps to a 
personal assistant. Now the agent is just doing
- [27:40] the work of that personal assistant for me. But I 
still have to tell it exactly how I want the work
- [27:44] to be done. Okay. Now I'm going to go ahead and 
save this one more time. Now this has the schedule
- [27:48] trigger. So this will run on that same time every 
single day and I will have that in my inbox every
- [27:56] single day. So I don't have to manually check 
all those client messages if they require me
- [28:00] to set up a meeting with them. And remember on 
the N8 website if you just click on AI there is
- [28:07] over 1500 AI different automations and they all 
work in a similar way where there's an AI agent
- [28:13] in the center of it all and it does all kinds of 
different things. So, if you search by popularity,
- [28:18] for example, you could see these are some AI 
agent chat bots that I'm making videos about,
- [28:23] different ways to use WhatsApp and other social 
media platforms, scraping web pages, all those
- [28:28] different things. You could click on them. And now 
that you have a good understanding on how a basic
- [28:32] one is built, you could see a much more complex 
one here that even combines multiple agents and
- [28:38] stacks them on top of each other. And a lot of 
these are free to use and they will be added
- [28:43] automatically to your account. And if this is the 
first time watching any of my videos, we have an
- [28:48] entire platform called Skill Leap. And with Skill 
Leap, you get access to over 20 different courses
- [28:55] that are very similar in the teaching style that 
I used in this video, but covers all the top AI
- [29:00] tools and all the different AI techniques that 
are available right now. And we partner with
- [29:05] other creators to bring you things that I'm 
not an expert in. So AI coding, for example,
- [29:10] Kevin from Futurepedia has a great course on using 
video tools to create short films and commercials.
- [29:15] And again, me and Andrew and other instructors 
have well over 20 different courses and we release
- [29:20] new courses every single month. And you get access 
to this under one subscription and it has a free
- [29:26] trial. So, with the free trial, you could watch 
a course, make sure it's a good fit, and once
- [29:30] you do subscribe, you get access to all our new 
courses, you get access to our community, and you
- [29:35] get access to all our resources, certificate, 
and much, much more. I'll put a link in the
- [29:39] description if you want to learn more about that. 
Okay, if this video helps you understand AI agents
- [29:44] better, please drop a like and let me know in the 
comment what kind of AI agents you're thinking
- [29:48] about building. Thanks so much for watching 
this video and I will catch you on the next
