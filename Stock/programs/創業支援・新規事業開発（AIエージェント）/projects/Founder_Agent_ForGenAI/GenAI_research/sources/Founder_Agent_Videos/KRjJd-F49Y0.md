- [00:00] I was finally able to build an AI
- [00:02] automation to handle a project for me
- [00:04] that I've been trying to build for a few
- [00:05] months now and I used Make AI agent for
- [00:08] it. So, I partnered with Make for this
- [00:10] video to show you exactly how it works.
- [00:12] Now, I'll give you a quick background on
- [00:13] this and I think a lot of people could
- [00:15] benefit from this type of automation.
- [00:17] I've been using ton of different tools
- [00:19] in the last couple years like custom
- [00:21] GPTs inside of chat GPT to repurpose my
- [00:24] YouTube videos and it's never really
- [00:26] clicked for me because it still requires
- [00:29] a lot of manual steps in the automation
- [00:31] process, right? I still have to click
- [00:33] things, copy and paste things and it's
- [00:35] something that I continuously keep
- [00:37] forgetting to do in my day-to-day work.
- [00:40] Now, with MakeAI agents, I was able to
- [00:42] build a real AI automation that handles
- [00:45] every step for me. So, if you haven't
- [00:47] used Make before or if you're new to it,
- [00:49] Make is a visual platform where you
- [00:52] could design, build, and automate just
- [00:54] about anything. Now, the new upgrade,
- [00:56] Make AI agents, they let you build
- [00:58] customizable AIdriven assistants that
- [01:01] could decide, adapt in real time, and
- [01:04] integrate with your workflows, too. And
- [01:06] make could connect just about anything.
- [01:08] Over 2,000 different apps across 30,000
- [01:10] different actions. So, pretty much
- [01:12] whatever you want to build, this could
- [01:13] probably connect it. And I've set myself
- [01:15] a brand new account here so you could
- [01:17] follow along. Any type of prompt that
- [01:19] I'm going to use. I'm going to include
- [01:20] in the description. And before we jump
- [01:22] in, make also gave me a free month of
- [01:25] the pro plan with 10,000 operations
- [01:27] included that I could give to you. So
- [01:29] I'll put a link in the description to
- [01:31] that plan so you could follow along with
- [01:33] the rest of the video. And I think this
- [01:35] is something you'll want to build for
- [01:36] yourself, too. So here inside of my make
- [01:38] account on the left side, you'll see
- [01:40] something called AI agents. So click on
- [01:42] this and we'll go ahead and click create
- [01:45] an agent to create our very first one.
- [01:47] Now the first thing it's going to ask
- [01:48] you is going to ask you to create a
- [01:50] connection. Now this connection is
- [01:52] simply asking what AI model you want to
- [01:54] use. That's the nice thing with this. It
- [01:56] gives you ton of different option. Now
- [01:58] I'm going to choose open AI. Make has
- [01:59] their own AI provider. You could use
- [02:01] Anthropic Gemini. Pretty much any AI
- [02:03] tool you want is under this dropdown.
- [02:06] But OpenAI the creators of chat GPT
- [02:08] because I'm going to use a chat GPT
- [02:09] model. I'm going to choose that one.
- [02:11] Then it's going to ask for my API key
- [02:13] here that comes directly from OpenAI. So
- [02:16] if you're totally new to these type of
- [02:18] AI automations, every time you want to
- [02:20] create some kind of automation, you will
- [02:22] need to get an API key from the company
- [02:25] that runs the AI model. In this case,
- [02:27] I'm going to use a version of chat GPT.
- [02:30] So that comes from OpenAI. Let me show
- [02:32] you exactly how to get that right now.
- [02:34] If you don't know how to get an API key
- [02:36] from OpenAI, it's available to everyone.
- [02:38] So, if you go to a website called
- [02:40] platform.openai.com,
- [02:42] it's going to bring you to this page and
- [02:44] you want to go ahead and log in or
- [02:46] create yourself a free account. Now,
- [02:48] this is totally separate from your
- [02:50] chatgpt.com account. This is to get an
- [02:53] API key so we can build those kind of
- [02:55] automations. I'm going to go to the
- [02:56] dashboard here and on the left side,
- [02:58] you'll see API keys over here. Now, I'm
- [03:01] going to go ahead and create a new
- [03:02] secret key. You could name it here and
- [03:05] create it. And most likely if it's your
- [03:06] first time creating one, it's going to
- [03:08] ask you for a credit card and you'll pay
- [03:10] open AAI on the OpenAI platform based on
- [03:12] API usage. And back on make it will ask
- [03:15] you to go to the OpenAI billing page
- [03:17] here. So it will link directly there
- [03:18] too. I'll save it now. Next, I'm going
- [03:20] to name this agent script repurposing
- [03:23] agent. And then I'm going to choose an
- [03:24] AI model. I actually like chat GPT 5
- [03:27] mini. Now, this is a good balance in my
- [03:29] opinion between a really smart AI model,
- [03:32] a fast AI model, and a very affordable
- [03:35] AI model from all the ones available.
- [03:37] Then you have your system prompt right
- [03:39] over here. So, system prompt is what the
- [03:42] agent needs to do the task that you're
- [03:44] going to give it. You want to describe
- [03:46] exactly what you want this agent to do.
- [03:48] Now, I'm going to paste mine here. Then
- [03:50] I'll walk you kind of briefly through
- [03:51] it, but I'll copy it in the description
- [03:53] below the video so you could kind of
- [03:55] copy and paste it for your own and go
- [03:57] ahead and edit it as you need to. Okay,
- [03:59] it brings us to this page here and I'll
- [04:01] walk you through the different settings.
- [04:02] This is where you set up your MakeAI
- [04:04] agent. Here you could click on improve
- [04:06] which I found really beneficial. It
- [04:08] improves your system prompt especially
- [04:10] if you're new to system prompting. But
- [04:12] to walk you through the basics of the
- [04:14] system prompt, I tell it what it is. So
- [04:17] you are a script repurposing agent. goal
- [04:19] is to repurpose YouTube scripts that I
- [04:22] write in Google Docs into two new
- [04:25] formats. So, the point of my agent, and
- [04:27] you could do this with a blog post, for
- [04:29] example, any type of document that you
- [04:31] have inside of Google Docs. I actually
- [04:33] don't have these videos on YouTube. I'm
- [04:35] not pulling them from YouTube. I pull
- [04:37] them directly after I write the script
- [04:39] in Google Docs. I'll show you how this
- [04:41] all works. Then what it does is first it
- [04:44] creates a 60-second YouTube short script
- [04:46] with a strong hook, three quick steps,
- [04:49] and one clear CTA. So it writes a new
- [04:52] script for me that's ready to read. I'm
- [04:54] going to show you what it does after
- [04:55] that, too. It writes a LinkedIn post for
- [04:57] me, and then I told it exactly what to
- [05:00] do with those things. I told it when
- [05:02] it's done writing that YouTube short
- [05:04] script to ping me on Slack to tell me
- [05:07] it's ready. So I go ahead and record it
- [05:08] like this. I like to create original
- [05:10] YouTube shorts and then on top of that
- [05:12] it will also post the LinkedIn post for
- [05:16] me. It will write one create a document
- [05:18] around it and post it for me and I could
- [05:21] build on top of it even more. But right
- [05:23] now that is doing two things that I was
- [05:25] always leaving on the table that I just
- [05:27] didn't get the time to do. They were not
- [05:29] fully automated that required copy and
- [05:31] pasting. This does it for me
- [05:32] automatically. Then you have context. So
- [05:35] this section is also a very important
- [05:37] section. background information,
- [05:39] additional context for your agent. So,
- [05:42] what I like to do here is actually tell
- [05:44] it the tone and the style of the
- [05:46] writing, but I want to show you how to
- [05:48] create a context document from scratch
- [05:50] in this step because this is something
- [05:52] you could use across all your AI
- [05:54] automations. So, because this is a
- [05:56] repurposing agent, I needed to have a
- [05:59] really clear understanding on how I like
- [06:00] to talk, my tone, my reading level for
- [06:03] the content that I write. So, what I'm
- [06:05] going to do is inside of chat GPT here,
- [06:07] I'm going to give it a simple prompt
- [06:08] like this. Analyze the following text
- [06:10] for writing style, the tone, the reading
- [06:13] level, and create a document for me
- [06:15] using canvas. This is a tool that chat
- [06:17] GPT has just to make it easier to read
- [06:19] and download that I can give an AI agent
- [06:21] to mimic my writing style. And then I'm
- [06:24] just going to paste something that I got
- [06:27] from a YouTube transcript. So, I just
- [06:29] went to YouTube on one of my videos and
- [06:30] I copied the transcript. You could do
- [06:32] this with anyone's writing or your own.
- [06:34] And I recommend if you wrote anything,
- [06:36] as long as there is enough like a
- [06:37] paragraph or two, it will have enough of
- [06:39] a sample here to analyze. And you can
- [06:41] see writing style, conversational, and
- [06:44] really, really detailed breakdown, tone,
- [06:47] reading level, whatever else you want to
- [06:49] analyze with your writing style, I
- [06:50] recommend you do that here. Okay. Now,
- [06:52] when it's done, I'm just going to press
- [06:54] download right on top. And you could
- [06:55] download any of these formats. Now,
- [06:57] markdowns are fine, too, but usually a
- [07:00] Word doc is fine. Now, back on make, I'm
- [07:02] going to add this context. And again,
- [07:03] you could do PDFs, text files, any type
- [07:05] of file. Just analyze your own writing
- [07:08] style. I'm going to upload mine. And
- [07:09] then I'm going to add a description
- [07:10] because you typically want to have a
- [07:12] really solid description with pretty
- [07:14] much every step of building an AI gen so
- [07:16] the agent knows everything that is going
- [07:18] on with this. So the context of this is
- [07:20] this is my writing style. Use it anytime
- [07:23] you repurpose any content. So I'm going
- [07:25] to go ahead and save that. Now you have
- [07:27] two more things here as you build your
- [07:28] agent. So, so far we had our AI model
- [07:31] that we picked in the very beginning. We
- [07:33] have the system prompt. Those are the
- [07:35] two most important things to get you
- [07:36] going. Then the context is optional, but
- [07:39] I like to give it something like I just
- [07:40] showed you. Then you have tools. So,
- [07:43] what makes an agent really powerful is
- [07:45] access to other tools. And there's a
- [07:47] couple of things you'll see over here.
- [07:49] First, you have MCPs. So, MCPS are a
- [07:51] connector. They could connect to pretty
- [07:53] much any type of an external server. So
- [07:56] that's one way to connect to just about
- [07:58] everything on the internet. But in this
- [08:01] case, we're going to use tools, which
- [08:02] are also things that could connect make
- [08:05] to other services. So with tools, you
- [08:08] have two options. I'm going to press add
- [08:09] here. You could add to modules or
- [08:12] scenarios. Now, this is really
- [08:14] interesting because modules could be
- [08:16] simple individual actions. And I have an
- [08:18] example for you to see, but if you want
- [08:20] one action to be done, a module is going
- [08:22] to be able to do that. connect to one
- [08:24] tool and one action. Scenarios are
- [08:26] entire workflows that you could connect
- [08:28] to and you could give the agent the
- [08:30] power of that entire scenario, which is
- [08:33] a really powerful option. And you could
- [08:35] pick and choose multiple module
- [08:37] scenarios this agent can have access to.
- [08:40] And once the agent does have that
- [08:42] access, it will be able to make those
- [08:43] decisions and complete those tasks for
- [08:46] you using those tools. Okay, let's go
- [08:48] ahead and start here with a couple of
- [08:49] tools that we need. The first one I'm
- [08:51] going to create is going to be a
- [08:52] scenario. So, it's going to be a
- [08:53] multi-step tool. Now, you could go ahead
- [08:55] and create it here, right? Since we
- [08:57] don't have one, it lets you create it
- [08:58] right over here. I typically actually
- [09:00] like to go to that page, scenarios page
- [09:04] right here. And you'll see all the
- [09:06] different scenarios you've built in the
- [09:07] past because you could use make just
- [09:10] with scenarios without the AI agents.
- [09:12] Obviously, when you give access to the
- [09:15] scenarios to the agent, it gets a lot
- [09:17] more powerful and it could start making
- [09:18] decision and do things a lot more than
- [09:21] just using the regular scenarios here.
- [09:23] But I'm going to go ahead and create one
- [09:25] here right on top and I'm going to go
- [09:26] ahead and build one from scratch. They
- [09:28] also have ton of different templates,
- [09:30] but in this case, I know exactly what I
- [09:32] want to happen. This is what the page
- [09:33] looks like. They got ton of different
- [09:35] tutorials if you haven't built these
- [09:36] before. Now the very first thing I like
- [09:38] to do is I just like to come up here and
- [09:40] I like to name the scenario so I don't
- [09:42] forget a lot of times if I start
- [09:44] creating it I forget to name it later
- [09:46] and with the agent the instruction you
- [09:48] give it a lot of times you could call
- [09:49] this by name this type of a tool or a
- [09:52] scenario it will go and fetch that and
- [09:54] then before I press the plus sign with
- [09:56] each of these down here you have an
- [09:59] input and an output I like to set this
- [10:01] right up front also and then I'll show
- [10:03] you exactly what's going to happen when
- [10:05] I press the plus sign But with the
- [10:07] input, let me add one here to explain
- [10:09] what's happening. I'm basically going to
- [10:11] tell it what I'm expecting to happen as
- [10:13] the input and what the output should be.
- [10:15] Now, I call a script text from a file
- [10:17] ID. You could name this whatever you
- [10:19] want, but it's best to have some kind of
- [10:21] a naming system that is easy for you to
- [10:23] remember. So, I have one here that I've
- [10:25] created. Then, I describe what's going
- [10:27] to happen. File ID from a Skillap
- [10:29] YouTube video, and it will get the text
- [10:31] document from that. It's in text format.
- [10:33] I leave default value to empty. And I'll
- [10:36] set this to be required here. So that's
- [10:38] it for input. And then I have an output
- [10:41] also. So I could add an output. What
- [10:43] happens at the end? And in this case,
- [10:45] it's going to get the script text, which
- [10:48] again, the description full YouTube text
- [10:50] from that doc. So it's going to be able
- [10:53] to with the file ID find a new document
- [10:56] and then extract the text and give the
- [10:58] agent that text. That's what this
- [11:00] workflow is going to do. And if you set
- [11:02] it to multi-line, it could write
- [11:04] multi-line. So, I'll set it to that.
- [11:05] I'll press save. Okay. So, now I have an
- [11:07] input and output ready. Now, I'm going
- [11:10] to press the plus sign and I'm going to
- [11:11] choose Google Docs, which again, there's
- [11:14] thousands of apps you could connect to
- [11:16] this way. Google Docs is obviously one
- [11:18] of them. And you have ton of different
- [11:20] actions within each document. In this
- [11:22] case, I wanted to get content from a
- [11:24] document. It's going to see when a new
- [11:26] document appears, and it'll get the
- [11:28] content from that. Then, it's going to
- [11:30] ask you to connect. Obviously, it's my
- [11:31] first time using it on this account. So,
- [11:33] you have to give a connection permission
- [11:35] to Google. So, I'll click on this and
- [11:38] set that up. Very simple. Okay. I
- [11:40] checked on all the requests. And by the
- [11:42] way, under the connections, you could
- [11:44] add new connections there anytime or
- [11:45] remove any existing one. Always
- [11:47] available there. I'm going to do by
- [11:49] mapping and I'm going to click on
- [11:51] document ID. Now, if you go to this tab
- [11:54] right here at the end, you'll see your
- [11:56] custom system variables. That's your
- [11:58] input that I selected myself. That's why
- [12:01] I set that up in the very beginning. It
- [12:03] always appears here. So, I could just
- [12:05] select it here. Now, you could do it by
- [12:07] dropdown, but I don't want to do it
- [12:09] right here by dropdown because I wanted
- [12:10] to map here to what's happening in my
- [12:13] actual account. And the document ID came
- [12:15] from that. I'm going to press save.
- [12:17] Okay. Now, I'm going to turn this into a
- [12:18] scenario right now. So, I'm going to
- [12:20] press the plus sign here. And there is
- [12:22] something called scenario. You could
- [12:24] look for it. It's this one right here.
- [12:25] I'm going to select it. And under action
- [12:27] here, I want it to return an output. And
- [12:30] if I click here, I want it to give me
- [12:32] the script text, right? And I have all
- [12:35] these different options available on
- [12:37] what it can do. So the one I want over
- [12:40] here is called text content. So I could
- [12:43] click on this right here. So this is
- [12:45] going to get the script text. I'm going
- [12:46] to save that. Okay. I'll go ahead and
- [12:48] save this here. Now, with this type of
- [12:50] scenario, it's also asking you to
- [12:52] actually change it on demand because
- [12:53] we're pulling something from Google
- [12:55] Drive here. So, I'm going to update that
- [12:57] schedule, and I'm going to go ahead and
- [12:59] turn this on demand when I'm ready. But
- [13:02] right now, I'm going to go ahead and
- [13:03] save it. So, we could actually do a
- [13:04] quick test. So, I'm just going to run it
- [13:06] once to run a test. And to run a test,
- [13:08] it will for input ask me for the file
- [13:11] ID. So, I'll just show you. If you go to
- [13:14] a Google Doc, you'll see your file ID
- [13:17] here right after the D. So this right
- [13:19] here is the file ID before edit. So it's
- [13:23] between d slash and edit. Again, that's
- [13:26] going to happen automatically. I'm just
- [13:28] doing a quick test here to make sure
- [13:30] it's working. So I'm going to input that
- [13:31] and press okay. And it's going to run.
- [13:34] And it's going to show you that it's
- [13:35] working. So you'll see one action was
- [13:37] taken here. One action was taken here.
- [13:40] And here under the log section on the
- [13:42] bottom, I could see exactly what
- [13:44] happened. As long as these turn green.
- [13:47] Okay. And you get that each action was
- [13:49] taken. This is working exactly like I
- [13:52] want. Now I could go ahead and turn it
- [13:54] on demand. Now I'm going to give my
- [13:56] agent access to this. Right now this is
- [13:58] just running as a scenario, but I'll
- [14:00] show you what happens once the agent has
- [14:02] access to it. Okay, let's go back to the
- [14:03] AI agent tab here and we'll go back to
- [14:06] our repurposing agent. So so far I just
- [14:09] created that new scenario. So I'm going
- [14:11] to press add and I'm going to add it.
- [14:13] Now, when you add it, it will show up
- [14:14] under the dropdown the way I made it.
- [14:16] So, I could click on it right over here,
- [14:18] and I could give it a description.
- [14:20] Remember, with AI agents, always
- [14:22] describe what this is supposed to do.
- [14:25] And this tool takes the file ID or
- [14:27] document ID that it finds in a new
- [14:29] script scenario and uses it to pull the
- [14:32] full script text. I'm going to go ahead
- [14:34] and add this one. Now, this agent has
- [14:37] the AI model in the background, has the
- [14:40] system instructions, has my context with
- [14:42] the tone, and has this one specific
- [14:44] tool. Now, this is already going to go
- [14:46] to work, but I want to build the whole
- [14:48] workflow. So, we're going to add a
- [14:49] couple more tools here. And this time,
- [14:51] we'll build some simpler ones. We'll
- [14:53] just do the modules. With the modules,
- [14:55] it's a one-off action, so they're really
- [14:57] easy to make. And we'll go ahead and
- [14:59] just build a module tool from this page.
- [15:01] Very straightforward with these. The
- [15:03] first one I'm going to create here is
- [15:05] going to be a Google Docs, but this time
- [15:07] it's going to be able to write a new
- [15:09] one. Right, we're repurposing content.
- [15:11] So, I'm going to choose that one. And
- [15:12] this is going to be able to create a new
- [15:14] document. So, a different action here.
- [15:16] And my description is going to be create
- [15:18] a document for shorts and LinkedIn post
- [15:21] text. It's going to be the same
- [15:22] document, but it's going to break it up.
- [15:24] And I explained it in the system
- [15:26] instruction to kind of break it up into
- [15:28] two different sections. It already knows
- [15:30] my connection because we already
- [15:31] connected to our Google accounts. For
- [15:33] the name and the context, I'm going to
- [15:35] ask the AI to decide for me here. And
- [15:38] then it's going to save it somewhere.
- [15:39] So, I don't want to save in the same
- [15:41] folder because it's going to create kind
- [15:42] of a loop. It's going to always see a
- [15:44] new document being created and try to
- [15:46] repurpose that. So, I'm going to create
- [15:48] this in a new folder that I'm going to
- [15:50] have which I already created called AI
- [15:52] created files. So, it will move into
- [15:54] that folder instead of the folder my
- [15:56] scripts are living in. And that's it for
- [15:58] creating new tools, these module tools,
- [16:00] because they're just one action. They
- [16:02] don't need a scenario like the one I
- [16:04] just created here. They just literally
- [16:06] do one thing, which is go create a new
- [16:09] document. Now, the next one, I'm
- [16:11] actually going to have it post on
- [16:12] LinkedIn for me. So, this is really
- [16:14] handy. We'll create a new one. This one
- [16:17] is going to be a LinkedIn and create a
- [16:19] user text post. In this case, I want to
- [16:22] actually post it to my company page. So,
- [16:24] create a company text post. And the name
- [16:27] of it is I'm going to put right here.
- [16:29] LinkedIn creates an organizational text
- [16:31] post. And in this description, because
- [16:33] I'm creating a doc that is multiple
- [16:36] different things for multiple platforms,
- [16:38] YouTube short being one of them. This
- [16:40] says share only the LinkedIn specific
- [16:42] repurposed content from the Google doc.
- [16:44] I'm going to go ahead and connect to my
- [16:46] LinkedIn account here because this is a
- [16:48] new connection. I've only connected to
- [16:49] OpenAI and Google so far. And I chose my
- [16:52] company page and I let AI decide the
- [16:54] content here. And we'll add one more
- [16:56] here. Okay. Now, this is going to notify
- [16:58] me on Slack when a new YouTube short is
- [17:00] ready, which again, this agent takes
- [17:01] care of. It takes my long form, makes a
- [17:04] short form. Now, this is a lot more
- [17:06] handy lately because we have other
- [17:07] researchers that are helping me with the
- [17:09] script writing process. So, maybe that
- [17:12] way as soon as it's ready and they put
- [17:14] it in my folder, this does the
- [17:16] repurposing. It does the posting on
- [17:18] LinkedIn and it's going to let me know
- [17:20] when a YouTube short is ready. So, I'll
- [17:22] create a new one. And this time we'll
- [17:24] choose Slack. You could send this to a
- [17:26] group in Slack, by the way, too. Or just
- [17:28] this is going to ping me directly.
- [17:30] Direct message. Create a send a message
- [17:32] on Slack. Again, I'll connect to Slack
- [17:34] here, too. And it's going to be a Slack
- [17:36] user. And this is going to be a direct
- [17:38] message sent to me on Slack on the Slack
- [17:40] channel I give it access to. And I'm
- [17:42] going to let AI decide the text here.
- [17:44] I'm going to let everything be decided
- [17:46] by AI. And I'll add. Okay, that's pretty
- [17:48] much it. You could build this a lot
- [17:50] more. You could post to a lot more
- [17:52] platforms, repurpose this in a lot of
- [17:55] different ways, but just to show you so
- [17:57] far, this is going to take a YouTube
- [17:59] script that gets created in Google Doc
- [18:01] in a specific folder. Then it's going to
- [18:03] actually repurpose it as a LinkedIn post
- [18:05] and a YouTube shorts script. Then it's
- [18:08] going to post it on LinkedIn and it's
- [18:10] going to notify me on Slack that this is
- [18:13] ready for me to now read a short version
- [18:16] of that script, too. Okay. So now you
- [18:18] could go ahead and do some testing here
- [18:20] if you want on the right side, but we
- [18:22] still need to create one more scenario
- [18:24] here. Okay. So let me go ahead and
- [18:26] create it and explain what this is going
- [18:27] to do. Now this one is actually not a
- [18:29] tool I'm making. I'm just making an
- [18:31] automation here for the agent to run
- [18:33] continuously. So I'm just going to call
- [18:35] this right on top run agent. That's the
- [18:38] job of this one. And again, if you build
- [18:40] more agents, name them accordingly
- [18:42] because you may want to have multiple
- [18:44] different agents doing multiple
- [18:46] different things. Now, this one actually
- [18:48] doesn't need input and output because
- [18:50] we're not giving it to the agent. That
- [18:52] was more specific because we were giving
- [18:53] something to the agent at the end. This
- [18:56] time, we're not doing that. So, I just
- [18:57] need to start here with a Google Drive
- [19:00] connection. Let me show you why. In
- [19:02] Google Drive, I wanted to actually find
- [19:04] out every time there is a new file. So,
- [19:07] they have an option for that. You could
- [19:09] do it with Google Docs, too, but I like
- [19:10] to use Google Drive for this. And only
- [19:13] because I wanted to specifically look
- [19:14] inside of that folder. So this says
- [19:16] trigger when a file is created inside of
- [19:18] a folder. So I'll choose that one. Now I
- [19:21] connected to Google Docs, but this is
- [19:22] going to ask me to connect to Google one
- [19:24] more time for Google Drive access. Now
- [19:26] this time I chose a very specific folder
- [19:28] here with the drop down. So I don't need
- [19:30] AI to decide anything here. I'm going to
- [19:32] limit it to just one so you could always
- [19:34] see the latest one. And I'll go ahead
- [19:36] and save that. And then you could tell
- [19:37] it from now on or on a specific date.
- [19:40] Now, the next thing is I'm going to
- [19:41] press the plus sign and I'm going to
- [19:42] choose make AI agent to then run that
- [19:45] agent. Okay, this option right here. And
- [19:47] if I click here under the different
- [19:49] agents that I have, I have one that I
- [19:51] created. So, I'll choose that agent
- [19:53] here. This is how you set up a schedule
- [19:55] to run the agent. It could be by itself
- [19:57] also. It doesn't have to be from a
- [19:59] trigger like this one. You could just
- [20:00] have the AI agent running as your first
- [20:03] action here, your first trigger. So, you
- [20:05] could see I have all the different
- [20:06] tools, scenarios, and modules. All those
- [20:09] are there. I could always add more here.
- [20:11] You'll also see any MCP if you connected
- [20:13] to external servers that way. Your
- [20:15] context is here. And down here, I'm
- [20:18] going to go ahead and add a message. And
- [20:20] this is going to be my starter message
- [20:21] as if I was talking to a regular
- [20:23] chatbot. This is the file ID for my new
- [20:26] script in Google Drive. Repurpose the
- [20:28] content. That's what I'm telling the
- [20:30] agent to do as a user. And here I'm
- [20:34] going to choose the file ID. So, that's
- [20:36] going to add it here organically every
- [20:38] time it gets created here. And that's
- [20:39] it. I'm going to go and save it from
- [20:41] there. Okay. Now that it's saved, I'm
- [20:42] going to go ahead and turn this on. Now,
- [20:44] this doesn't actually have to run every
- [20:46] 15 minutes, right? Because I don't get a
- [20:48] YouTube script every 15 minutes. I get
- [20:50] it once a day. So, I could do this every
- [20:53] day at a specific time, right? Depending
- [20:55] on what our schedule looks like. So,
- [20:57] this should be fine right now. I'm going
- [20:59] to press save. So, as soon as a script
- [21:01] is ready, it'll know that. And usually
- [21:03] by 3:00, we have one ready. So it'll run
- [21:06] exactly then. Now just for the sake of
- [21:08] testing, I'm going to just change this
- [21:09] to run right now so I could show you the
- [21:12] output that I'm getting. Okay. So it
- [21:14] went and checked for Google Drive. So
- [21:16] one action ran there and it knows that I
- [21:18] created a new document. I actually just
- [21:20] copied the script here and it created it
- [21:23] in the same folder as I have all my
- [21:25] scripts. So now the agent is going to
- [21:27] work and after a few seconds it's done.
- [21:29] So let's check its work. Let's go to
- [21:31] Google Docs first. Okay. So, here's the
- [21:33] document it created for me. It created a
- [21:35] YouTube short. Now, with YouTube shorts,
- [21:37] I actually like to break it down this
- [21:39] way into hook steps. That's where the
- [21:41] custom instruction, that system prompt
- [21:43] that I gave it comes into play. So,
- [21:45] that's why it's formatted this way. The
- [21:48] LinkedIn post is not formatted that way
- [21:50] because this is going to go ahead and
- [21:51] post it. Now, I might want more line
- [21:53] breaks, maybe a couple emojis thrown in
- [21:55] there, but that's where again my system
- [21:57] prompt comes in. context is following
- [22:00] how my conversational style is and it's
- [22:03] writing in that tone. And again, if you
- [22:05] build this out even further, you could
- [22:07] have one for X, for example, for
- [22:08] Facebook. You could just build this out
- [22:10] for other type of content you want to
- [22:12] post either manually or automatically.
- [22:15] Now, on LinkedIn, here's my actual
- [22:17] profile, my business profile. One minute
- [22:19] ago, I automated my YouTube script
- [22:21] repurposing with make AI agent in
- [22:23] minutes. And this came exactly from the
- [22:25] script for this exact video. So I could
- [22:27] show you what the output looks like
- [22:29] here. And I think it's pretty good. And
- [22:30] if I go to my Slack over here, there it
- [22:32] is. My YouTube short script. I automated
- [22:35] YouTube shorts with make AI agent.
- [22:36] That's the script that got repurposed.
- [22:38] This link should take me directly to
- [22:40] this where I could go ahead and read
- [22:42] that. And for the LinkedIn section too,
- [22:44] it showed me exactly what's been posted
- [22:46] on LinkedIn. So, it's nice to get a
- [22:48] Slack message just to check what is
- [22:50] posting. If I want to make some
- [22:51] alteration or fix my system prompt, the
- [22:54] whole point is just run this and keep
- [22:56] improving on it till you have something
- [22:58] you're really happy with and your
- [22:59] automation is running according to plan.
- [23:01] Now, as you build more automations and
- [23:03] more of these AI agents, it gets easy to
- [23:05] lose track of where everything connects.
- [23:08] So, make has introduced a new update
- [23:10] called Make Grid that fixes a lot of
- [23:12] that for you. Now you could access grid
- [23:14] on the left section here on the sidebar.
- [23:17] You could also look at it on these
- [23:19] individual scenarios here. So I'll show
- [23:21] you this one right here. So you could
- [23:23] see a nice visual presentation here and
- [23:25] you could move around your entire
- [23:27] organization. So again, as this gets
- [23:29] more complicated, it's nice to zoom out
- [23:31] to see big picture and zoom in. And you
- [23:33] could select by layer. So for example, I
- [23:35] want to see how my data is being
- [23:37] transferred. It's going to show me that.
- [23:39] If I want to see how my credits are
- [23:41] being used, I could see that by credits.
- [23:44] Again, this is a brand new account, but
- [23:45] you could see how powerful this could
- [23:47] become as you have more data, more
- [23:49] tools, more agent. You could get a
- [23:51] really nice view to see how they talk to
- [23:53] each other here through all kinds of
- [23:55] different ways. And I think if anything
- [23:57] breaks, this is a nice place to come
- [23:58] back to to see how everything is
- [24:00] working. And this makes building AI
- [24:02] agents a lot less of a mystery, right?
- [24:04] You have a lot more control here and you
- [24:06] could see exactly what's going on. And
- [24:07] when you are done testing everything,
- [24:09] this is again where you could run your
- [24:11] agent and turn it on and it will run
- [24:14] based on the schedule that you set here.
- [24:16] Mine was daily. You could set it as
- [24:17] often as you want here depending on your
- [24:20] use case. So hopefully that example of
- [24:22] that make AI agent showed you a few
- [24:24] different ways you could create AI
- [24:25] agents for yourself to automate all
- [24:27] kinds of different things in your
- [24:28] business. Again, make sure to grab the
- [24:31] link in the description and take
- [24:32] advantage of that free month of the pro
- [24:34] plan and start building your AI agent
- [24:36] today. Thank you so much for watching
- [24:38] this video.
