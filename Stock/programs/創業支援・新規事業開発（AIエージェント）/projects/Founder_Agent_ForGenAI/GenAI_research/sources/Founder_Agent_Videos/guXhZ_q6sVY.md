- [00:00] Hey there, I'm Joe Moa and I have
- [00:01] something very exciting to share with
- [00:03] you today. We're launching a new course,
- [00:05] design, develop, and deploy multi- aent
- [00:08] systems with Cai on a partnership with
- [00:10] deep learning [music] AI. And you don't
- [00:12] want to miss on this one because we're
- [00:13] going to talk about everything there is
- [00:15] to know about AI agents. AI agents have
- [00:17] so much potential to reshape businesses
- [00:20] from streamlining fraud detection in
- [00:22] finance [music] to automatically
- [00:24] processing product returns on retail to
- [00:26] analyzing customer behavior in
- [00:28] communications. If you really think
- [00:30] about it, the genie is not getting back
- [00:32] into the bottom. There's not going to be
- [00:33] a word where people are going to use
- [00:35] less AI agents. If anything, it's going
- [00:38] to be even more. So, this can have a
- [00:39] direct impact in your career and how
- [00:42] you're going to build the systems in the
- [00:43] future. I'm the CEO and founder of
- [00:45] Crayi, and my goal for Crayi was to
- [00:47] share an open-source framework that is
- [00:49] loved by AI builders and trust by AI
- [00:52] leaders. So, this course is meant for
- [00:54] everyone who wants to learn how to build
- [00:56] multi-agent systems. It's one of the
- [00:58] most important skills on AI today. No
- [01:00] matter your spot on the path to
- [01:02] production, this course is for you. It's
- [01:04] not enough to just build something fast.
- [01:07] You want to make sure that something
- [01:08] that is trust worth it so that you can
- [01:11] manage and scale it. And in this course,
- [01:13] we're going to talk about all the
- [01:14] fundamentals from agents to tasks to
- [01:17] common communication patterns and even
- [01:19] how to configure these agents to use
- [01:21] tools, web search or MCP. Memory is a
- [01:25] key piece and we're going to dive deep
- [01:26] into how that works and how that helps
- [01:28] with your agents, including guard rails
- [01:31] and flows when you want to have that
- [01:33] low-level control. Finally, you make
- [01:35] your agents ready to serve [music]
- [01:37] thousands of customers using
- [01:39] sophisticated techniques like tracing to
- [01:41] track error sources or hooks to set up
- [01:43] and clean up executions and evaluation
- [01:46] to track progress over time. You're
- [01:48] going to hear directly from people that
- [01:50] are building the systems in production
- [01:52] today. I'm very excited to invite some
- [01:54] of friends and customers that have been
- [01:56] building with curi in production to tell
- [01:59] you all about it, what works and what it
- [02:01] doesn't and how you should be thinking
- [02:03] about AI agents. I will share my
- [02:05] personal experience on thinking about
- [02:07] this use cases and actually building
- [02:09] them. So this is a unique opportunity.
- [02:11] Make sure that you enroll today and I
- [02:13] hope to see you there in a second.
