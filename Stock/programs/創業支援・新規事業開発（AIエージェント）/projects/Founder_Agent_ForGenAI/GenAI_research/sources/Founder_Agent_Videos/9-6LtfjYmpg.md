- [00:00] The entire planet earth is obsessed with
- [00:02] one thing AI agents. Everyone wants to
- [00:04] build AI agents but when you start there
- [00:06] is a confusion. Should you use this fast
- [00:09] drag and drop approach of no code tools
- [00:12] such as Zepier and etc to build agents
- [00:16] before even your chai gets cold or
- [00:18] should you go slowly write code using
- [00:21] agentic frameworks such as crew AI and
- [00:23] langraph. Don't worry in this video we
- [00:25] are going to cut through the noise and
- [00:28] settle this debate. No code versus code
- [00:30] agentic frameworks. Which one is right
- [00:32] for you? The coding approach is similar
- [00:34] to using manual mode in this DSLR camera
- [00:38] where you get total fine grain control
- [00:40] and you can get probably the best
- [00:42] picture. The downside is the steep
- [00:45] learning curve. Using no code tool is
- [00:47] similar to shooting in auto mode where
- [00:50] you just turn the knob, start shooting
- [00:51] the pictures. It is very fast but you
- [00:54] don't get as much control as you get in
- [00:56] manual mode. We are going to evaluate
- [00:58] this on four different parameters. The
- [01:00] first one is speed. With no code tools,
- [01:03] you can build agents in minutes by just
- [01:06] using drag and drop. Whereas the coding
- [01:08] approach is slow. You're going through
- [01:10] iterations fixing one bug after another.
- [01:13] So the question is why should you do
- [01:15] coding at all? Well, that's where the
- [01:17] second factor comes in play which is
- [01:20] customization. With coding tools such as
- [01:22] langraph, crew etc. you get lot of
- [01:26] custom control. You can build your own
- [01:28] memory. You can fine-tune the tool usage
- [01:31] etc. Whereas by using no code tools, you
- [01:35] are restricted to the integrations and
- [01:37] tools that the platform provides. The
- [01:39] third factor is learning curve. With no
- [01:42] code tool, there is not much significant
- [01:45] learning curve because you're not
- [01:46] writing any code. You are just dragging
- [01:48] and dropping the pre-built components
- [01:50] and connecting them to build agentic AI
- [01:53] workflows. It is accessible and
- [01:55] intuitive. It puts the power in the
- [01:57] hands of people who don't have technical
- [01:59] background. For example, business
- [02:01] analyst, marketing folks, product
- [02:03] managers making them citizen developers.
- [02:06] On the other hand, when you're using
- [02:07] coding frameworks such as Langraph, you
- [02:09] need to know coding in depth. Not only
- [02:12] that, you need to also have good
- [02:14] understanding of agentic AI principles.
- [02:16] So when you start on that project, you
- [02:18] have to hire AI engineer who has all
- [02:20] those skills and if you don't have those
- [02:22] skills, learning those skills is going
- [02:24] to take some time. But at the end of the
- [02:26] day, coding gives you custom control.
- [02:28] Let's say you have a legacy database
- [02:30] that you want to connect with your agent
- [02:32] system. You can't do that with no code
- [02:34] tool because most likely NAN or Zapier
- [02:37] will not have integration for it. So you
- [02:39] have to use Langraph, Qi etc to write
- [02:42] your own custom code. The fourth factor
- [02:44] is cost. Cost is usually low when you
- [02:48] are using no code tools initially but
- [02:51] when you start using that system at
- [02:53] scale your cost will go high because
- [02:55] these no code tools will charge you for
- [02:58] your usage. Whereas if you're using
- [03:00] coding frameworks the initial cost is
- [03:03] higher because you are hiring AI
- [03:04] engineers and you are paying them a big
- [03:07] salary but at scale overall it is going
- [03:10] to be your cheaper option. And here is a
- [03:12] metric summarizing all those four
- [03:14] factors. So now the question is which
- [03:16] one should you use? Well, it depends. It
- [03:20] depends on your goal and expertise. If
- [03:22] you are a business analyst trying to
- [03:24] automate a simple workflow, no coding is
- [03:26] a way to go because that can get you up
- [03:28] and running in minutes. But if you are
- [03:30] an engineer building a complex product
- [03:32] feature that is going to be used by
- [03:34] millions of users, then coding will give
- [03:36] you necessary control and cost
- [03:38] optimization. In many cases however
- [03:40] combining both the approaches is often
- [03:43] the best choice. Say you are a marketing
- [03:45] person having amazing idea to automate
- [03:48] your marketing workflow. You can use nit
- [03:50] to build that prototype and roll it out
- [03:52] to few users to validate your idea and
- [03:55] once it looks good now AI engineer can
- [03:58] use some codebased framework to build a
- [04:01] production grade highly scalable system.
- [04:04] This bridges the gap between non- tech
- [04:06] professionals and engineers in a way
- [04:08] that they can work together. If you want
- [04:10] to build your first AI agent using no
- [04:13] code tools, then here's a video link. If
- [04:15] you want to learn coding frameworks such
- [04:17] as Langraph and Crew AI, then I have
- [04:19] videos for that too. Let me know in the
- [04:22] comments which framework you're most
- [04:23] excited to learn.
