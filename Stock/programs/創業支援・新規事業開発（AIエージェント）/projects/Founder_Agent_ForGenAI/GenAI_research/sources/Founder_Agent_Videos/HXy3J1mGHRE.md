- [00:00] And this is, I think,
- [00:01] the most important outcome
- [00:03] that I've had from
- [00:04] more than two decades of implementing
- [00:06] those technologies
- [00:08] is the companies that succeed are
- [00:10] only the ones that put the people
- [00:12] in the center of that transformation.
- [00:22] Welcome to WorkLab,
- [00:23] the podcast from Microsoft.
- [00:24] I'm your host, Molly Wood.
- [00:25] On WorkLab, we talk to experts about AI
- [00:28] and the future of work,
- [00:29] from how the technology can supercharge
- [00:31] human capabilities
- [00:32] to how it can transform
- [00:34] entire organizations.
- [00:36] Our guest today is Pascal Bornet.
- [00:38] Bornet is a globally recognized
- [00:40] expert in artificial intelligence
- [00:42] and intelligent automation.
- [00:44] He's led AI transformations
- [00:46] at McKinsey and EY,
- [00:47] and he's written bestselling books on AI.
- [00:50] Pascal is the coauthor of a new book
- [00:52] called Agenetic Artificial Intelligence:
- [00:55] Harnessing AI Agents
- [00:56] to Reinvent Business, Work and Life.
- [00:58] In short,
- [00:59] Pascal has deep understanding
- [01:01] of how AI can automate and elevate work.
- [01:05] We're going to dig into
- [01:06] how these intelligent agents,
- [01:08] think of them like your digital coworkers,
- [01:10] are poised to transform the workplace,
- [01:13] and critically,
- [01:14] how business leaders can harness them
- [01:16] to hone their competitive edge.
- [01:18] Pascal, welcome to WorkLab.
- [01:20] Thank you.
- [01:20] Thank you Molly. Excited to be with you.
- [01:22] So happy to have you.
- [01:23] So if you wouldn't mind, actually,
- [01:25] let's sort of start on
- [01:27] a bit of your journey.
- [01:28] You have been focused on AI
- [01:30] and automation for over two decades.
- [01:32] And you have seen a lot change
- [01:34] in that time.
- [01:35] Give us a brief background, if you would.
- [01:37] Yeah, definitely.
- [01:38] So I'm coming from two decades
- [01:40] of consulting experience,
- [01:42] implementing automation, and building
- [01:46] intelligent automation
- [01:47] practices at EY and McKinsey.
- [01:51] So basically
- [01:52] implementing those technologies
- [01:53] for corporates around the world
- [01:55] and really around the world,
- [01:56] because I used to live,
- [01:58] I'm from France originally,
- [02:00] you can hear from my accent.
- [02:02] I lived in
- [02:03] Asia for almost ten years
- [02:05] and have been in the US for the last
- [02:08] seven years now.
- [02:09] So yeah, what I saw of,
- [02:11] I mean, and in terms of
- [02:13] experience of implementing those,
- [02:15] intelligent automation transformations.
- [02:18] So first of all, what do we hear by that?
- [02:20] You've heard about
- [02:21] robotic process automation
- [02:23] I'm sure, script automations.
- [02:26] So these are the
- [02:28] old kind of agents, basically,
- [02:30] that we used to have,
- [02:32] that were acting autonomously,
- [02:35] to perform actions for humans.
- [02:38] Okay,
- [02:39] and now we are-
- [02:39] I’m sure we are going to talk about this,
- [02:41] but we are going
- We definitely are.
- [02:42] to a new level of intelligence,
- [02:45] thanks to large language models that,
- [02:48] are converging
- [02:49] with these automations
- [02:50] that we used to do,
- [02:51] and that are
- [02:53] creating what we call AI agents.
- [02:55] So basically entities that can help us,
- [02:59] that can understand contexts,
- [03:01] that can understand goals
- [03:02] that can plan actions and that can learn
- [03:06] from the outcome of those actions
- [03:08] and improve themselves in time.
- [03:11] And the big,
- [03:12] the big
- [03:12] and the big trigger has been,
- [03:14] basically the large language models
- [03:15] that came,
- [03:17] in at the beginning of the 2020.
- [03:19] Right.
- [03:20] And I think you had-
- [03:21] you have people now
- [03:22] who understand what we mean
- [03:23] when we say large language model.
- [03:24] You, of course, are early,
- [03:26] very early to the concept of agents,
- [03:29] and now we are talking about agentic
- [03:32] artificial intelligence.
- [03:33] And some of these words just appeared
- [03:35] and I think are a bit
- [03:36] new for some people.
- [03:37] I wonder how you define
- [03:39] agentic, artificial,
- [03:40] artificial intelligence
- [03:41] or even just agents.
- [03:43] Yes, yes yes. So,
- [03:45] when I talk about
- [03:46] large language models, I'm
- [03:47] talking about generative
- [03:49] AI in the form of ChatGPT, for example.
- [03:52] So those chatbots that help,
- [03:57] have, that have been trained on
- [03:59] large amount of data
- [04:01] that can answer questions,
- [04:02] be creative, help us plan things.
- [04:05] I mean, every one of us has tried them
- [04:07] and what they are good at,
- [04:10] those chat bots,
- [04:11] they are good at planning,
- [04:12] at answering our questions,
- [04:15] and I'm sure you've tried it as well.
- [04:17] Try to plan your weekend in New York.
- [04:20] So you will ask:
- [04:21] “I want great food experience,
- [04:23] I want to do this, I want museums,
- [04:25] I want that,
- [04:26] I want this for my kids,” so on.
- [04:28] And it's going to plan everything
- [04:29] great for you.
- [04:30] “Yeah, you will do this,
- [04:31] you will go to this,
- [04:33] great restaurant that nobody knows,
- [04:35] it's gonna-” okay.
- [04:36] And then you try to book them,
- [04:39] because those kind of large language models
- [04:41] can’t book for you.
- [04:42] They can't do anything,
- [04:43] they can just suggest things, okay?
- [04:45] And when you try to book,
- [04:46] you see that it's not available now,
- [04:49] you need to book
- [04:49] three months in advance,
- [04:51] it's closed for renovation,
- [04:52] and so on and so on, and you get upset,
- [04:54] of course as always.
- [04:56] So this is the generative AI
- [04:58] large language model
- [04:59] period that we've been since 2022,
- [05:03] when ChatGPT was born.
- [05:05] And the big frustration with that
- [05:08] is that, first of all,
- [05:09] we need to book everything.
- [05:11] So basically the language model,
- [05:14] that's the fun thing, it researches
- [05:16] it finds great ideas,
- [05:18] it is creative
- [05:20] and gives everything
- [05:21] to us, the plan to us,
- [05:22] and then we need to book,
- [05:23] we need to do everything
- [05:24] that is the logistics
- [05:25] that we don't like to do, that,
- [05:27] no,
- [05:28] we don't like
- [05:29] we wouldn't like humans to do that.
- [05:31] So that's the first thing,
- [05:32] it's giving to us, all those
- [05:35] crappy things to do.
- [05:36] So we have information,
- [05:37] but we still need action.
- [05:38] Exactly.
- [05:39] And information,
- [05:42] when you think about it, information
- [05:44] without action
- [05:45] is very limited in the impact
- [05:47] it can give you.
- [05:48] So back to our example,
- [05:50] if you- if you knew before
- [05:52] that the hotel was closed
- [05:53] for renovation, you would not
- [05:55] you would have done something
- [05:56] completely different.
- [05:57] And this is an actionable, practical
- [06:00] intelligence that we need
- [06:01] in our human world.
- [06:03] - Right. 
- And so
- [06:07] agents are giving us this capacity
- [06:10] not only to suggest, but to act
- [06:13] and to get to the impact
- [06:14] that we are expecting.
- [06:16] So I took the example
- [06:17] of booking holidays, but easily
- [06:19] you can think about,
- [06:22] entering data, creating invoices,
- [06:26] managing clients, relationships.
- [06:29] I mean, you name it,
- [06:31] the number of use cases is,
- [06:35] unlimited. 
- Staggering. Yeah.
- [06:37] So I wonder, you have even said,
- [06:40] you know,
- [06:41] certainly the use cases are unlimited,
- [06:43] the agents are coming,
- [06:45] you have said soon there won't-
- [06:46] we won't say there's an app for that,
- [06:48] we will say there is an agent for that.
- [06:51] - Yes.
- And I wonder how soon you think that is.
- [06:54] I think it was in 2007
- [06:56] that the iPhone was launched
- [07:00] with the first app store
- [07:01] and the first apps, basically.
- [07:05] So they transformed the
- [07:05] way we accessed services
- [07:07] and the agents are
- [07:10] going to do something
- [07:11] even more important than that.
- [07:13] You know those apps,
- [07:15] they require humans to learn
- [07:17] how to use them.
- [07:19] -True.
- These agents,
- [07:21] They will learn how to serve us.
- [07:24] So basically,
- [07:24] they will use those apps on our behalf.
- [07:27] So instead of humans
- [07:29] adapting to technology,
- [07:30] that's a big paradigm shift, in my view.
- [07:33] It is technology
- [07:34] that is finally adapting to humans.
- [07:36] So we are moving from a world where,
- [07:40] you need dozens of different
- [07:41] apps on your phone
- [07:43] to a world
- [07:43] where you just have
- [07:45] one intelligent agent
- [07:47] that can orchestrate everything for you
- [07:50] just based on what you ask.
- [07:52] So then let's take this to the business
- [07:55] world.
- Yes.
- [07:56] And imagine, from a business leader’s
- [07:59] perspective, why is this so crucial
- [08:02] to the future of business?
- [08:03] And let's keep exploring
- [08:05] how it's different from the models
- [08:06] that we've worked with in the past.
- [08:08] So, I like to
- [08:12] explain and define an agent,
- [08:14] by the four key functions it works on.
- [08:19] So first of all, an agent senses
- [08:20] the environment so it can understand us,
- [08:22] it can hear us
- [08:24] basically, or it can see something.
- [08:26] Based on what it sees,
- [08:29] It's going to plan an action
- [08:31] according to a goal that we need it to-
- [08:33] that it needs to achieve.
- [08:34] It will say, okay,
- [08:35] the first step is to do this.
- [08:36] The second is to do that.
- [08:37] Then I will do this and this and that.
- [08:39] Okay.
- [08:39] Then it is going to act on the basis
- [08:41] of this plan.
- [08:43] And finally it's going to reflect.
- [08:44] So basically it's going to see:
- [08:46] “Okay, so my goal was to achieve
- [08:49] this outcome,
- [08:50] I have achieved that outcome.”
- [08:52] So how different it is
- [08:53] and what can I learn from it.
- [08:56] And when you think about it, it's
- [08:57] very similar to how we humans do.
- [09:00] So when we, for example,
- [09:02] you want to cook something,
- [09:04] you want to cook pasta,
- [09:05] you will say, “Okay,
- [09:06] let me sense around me in my kitchen,
- [09:08] what ingredients do I have?
- [09:10] Oh I have pasta, I have tomato sauce.”
- [09:12] That's the sense.
- [09:14] Then you will say, “Okay, so I need
- [09:15] first of all to boil my water,
- [09:17] then to bring my pasta,
- [09:19] then to-” okay, different steps.
- [09:20] That's a recipe.
- [09:21] So that's the plan.
- [09:23] A is you, you act.
- [09:25] So basically you do it.
- [09:26] And finally, when you've done it,
- [09:28] you've tasted it,
- [09:29] you say, “Okay, next time
- [09:31] I will cook it a bit longer,
- [09:32] I will put a bit more salt,
- [09:34] and do this differently.”
- [09:36] So this is basically a framework
- [09:39] that I really recommend to my clients,
- [09:41] doing a lot of
- [09:42] consulting in this space,
- [09:45] that I call the SPAR framework,
- [09:47] that helps leaders to understand
- [09:50] better what agents can do,
- [09:53] and when we design agents,
- [09:55] it helps to understand
- [09:57] holistically what you can do with them.
- [10:00] From sensing,
- [10:01] to planning, to acting, to reflecting.
- [10:04] And when you compare different vendors
- [10:06] or different technologies,
- [10:08] you can also have a better view,
- [10:11] a better framework, basically to understand.
- [10:14] What are you seeing from
- [10:15] the business leaders who have
- [10:15] implemented this so far?
- [10:17] Certainly,
- [10:18] it sounds like you're really requiring
- [10:20] a strategic onboarding,
- [10:22] but have you seen examples of agentic AI
- [10:25] in action that demonstrates the value?
- [10:28] Oh yes, definitely.
- [10:30] Can you can you share any of them?
- [10:31] - Of course! Of course of course.
- Or are those secret?
- [10:33] Of course.
- [10:35] I mean, my preferred ones are-
- [10:38] I'm going to talk a lot about,
- [10:40] Pets at Home, for example,
- [10:41] Pets at Home is
- [10:42] the UK's largest pet care company.
- [10:46] They achieved a 99% accuracy
- [10:50] in transcribing
- [10:51] veterinary consultations
- [10:54] with an ambient digital scribe.
- [10:56] So basically an agent,
- [10:58] that is here during the consultation
- [11:00] and that can take notes
- [11:02] of everything that is happening,
- [11:04] perform all the transactional work
- [11:08] that is behind, preparing,
- [11:11] I mean, connecting with the
- [11:12] patient's data.
- [11:16] Yeah, doing all this logistic work that takes
- [11:19] 80% of the veterinarian’s time.
- [11:24] And so that this time can be refocused
- [11:26] on the patient
- [11:27] and the same company, Pets at Home,
- [11:29] has created several agents.
- [11:32] Another one is a fruit detection agent.
- [11:34] So basically it puts patterns
- [11:36] that humans can’t see.
- [11:38] So for example,
- [11:40] the same damaged package photo
- [11:43] that can be used multiple times
- [11:45] by people who are requesting a refund.
- [11:47] It's going to match these and identify
- [11:49] okay, that's a fraud.
- [11:53] We don't- we won’t
- [11:56] pay you back your money.
- [11:58] They also have an insurance
- [11:59] integration agent,
- [12:00] basically an agent
- [12:01] that automatically checks
- [12:02] policy coverage
- [12:04] in real time
- [12:05] during veterinary, consultations.
- [12:07] They have also a store colleague assistant
- [12:09] that provides
- [12:10] personalized guidance to staff
- [12:12] based on their specificities.
- [12:14] For example, the specialist in aquarium,
- [12:17] will get relevant
- [12:18] operating procedures
- [12:19] to automatically do things.
- [12:21] Well,
- [12:22] - Meaningful. Meaningful.
- So this use case is really-
- [12:25] Yeah, definitely, definitely.
- [12:26] You can imagine
- [12:27] use cases really across the board.
- [12:29] Top of my mind,
- [12:31] agents that I'm working on currently,
- [12:33] invoice to pay agents.
- [12:34] So basically those agents that
- [12:36] read the invoices
- [12:37] that you receive that matches
- [12:39] those invoices to the POs,
- [12:41] to the purchase orders,
- [12:43] that approve them
- [12:44] and that can pay them based on
- [12:46] certain conditions, recruitment agents
- [12:49] that sources candidates, screens CVs,
- [12:52] and schedules interviews.
- [12:54] The learning agent that personalizes
- [12:57] training path for employees
- [12:58] based on on their performance
- [13:00] and their role.
- [13:01] The marketing campaign agent
- [13:02] that designs, tests
- [13:04] and optimizes multi-channel
- [13:05] marketing campaigns in real time.
- [13:07] Retention agent that detects
- [13:09] turn risk of clients, and
- [13:11] - It’s so amazing Pascal,
- launches proactive retention offers.
- [13:14] I have to- Clearly,
- [13:15] what's amazing is that
- [13:16] I think some business leaders
- [13:17] are having a hard time
- [13:18] imagining use cases,
- [13:19] and you have an infinite list.
- [13:22] That's that's really the magic.
- [13:24] The magic of
- [13:25] of these technology
- [13:27] is that they can be applied
- [13:29] to any function and any industry.
- [13:33] - Yeah. 
- Okay.
- [13:34] Really across-
- [13:34] it's really across the board and,
- [13:36] and the out-
- [13:37] I mean, just to give you a bit of,
- [13:41] what you can expect from those,
- [13:43] from implementing
- [13:44] agentic artificial intelligence in your company,
- [13:49] JPMorgan reduced fraud by 70%.
- [13:53] McKinsey reduced
- [13:55] client onboarding lead time by 90%.
- [13:58] So just to give you a few
- [13:59] a bit of examples of the impact,
- [14:03] the business impact you can get.
- [14:04] Wow.
- [14:05] Okay, we are sold on the examples,
- [14:07] now I wonder,
- Yes.
- [14:08] now I wonder about,
- [14:12] as leaders are making these decisions.
- [14:13] For example,
- [14:14] Microsoft's latest Work Trend Index
- [14:16] pointed out
- [14:16] that more than 80% of leaders surveyed
- [14:20] do plan to do this.
- [14:21] They plan to use
- [14:22] AI and agents to fill this capacity gap
- [14:26] between their demands
- [14:27] and what human employees can deliver.
- [14:30] Do you feel like that number is accurate?
- [14:32] Are you seeing 80% uptake?
- [14:37] They plan to use, definitely.
- [14:40] I mean I,
- [14:42] we see a lot of traction,
- [14:43] a lot of companies.
- [14:44] I mean, I think all companies want
- [14:47] want to implement.
- [14:48] They all have the ambition to do that.
- [14:51] Some of them are doing it.
- [14:52] They are doing it the right way,
- [14:54] and they are getting the
- [14:55] the outcome that they expect.
- [14:56] I talked about a few of them.
- [14:58] Some others are trying it,
- [15:00] they are not doing it the right way,
- [15:01] so they fail.
- [15:04] They, they fall into some
- [15:06] some issues, like,
- [15:08] agents that are built without
- [15:11] having the proper design,
- [15:13] and for example,
- [15:16] not performing the actions
- [15:17] and the processes,
- [15:18] the right way.
- [15:19] Or processing them,
- [15:20] but not with the right security
- [15:23] and the right guardrails
- [15:24] that we would expect.
- [15:28] See companies that are only focusing on
- [15:30] one use case, one function,
- [15:32] instead of bringing it to the whole-
- [15:33] to different departments
- [15:36] and increase the
- [15:37] the scale of the impact
- [15:38] and create
- [15:39] economies of scale as well.
- [15:41] So those are- and the list is very long,
- [15:45] of critical success factors
- [15:46] that need to be implemented.
- [15:49] And because I've been repeating and
- [15:53] and seeing those issues many times,
- [15:56] in companies,
- [15:57] I've told myself,
- [15:58] why not put this into a book,
- [16:00] so that
- [16:01] I don't need to come to
- [16:03] to this company's offices,
- [16:05] - Right. 
- to share all this.
- [16:06] I'm here.
- [16:07] Only me and my team.
- [16:10] So that's why we we wrote the book,
- [16:12] Agentic Artificial Intelligence,
- [16:14] that was published a few months ago,
- [16:17] and that talks about.
- [16:20] Where are we with this technology?
- [16:22] What are the critical success factors
- [16:24] to get there?
- [16:25] And that shares hands-on experience
- [16:28] on how
- [16:29] we get to business impact
- [16:31] using this technology.
- [16:32] - Congratulations, by the way.
- Great, great potential.
- [16:34] Thank you.
- [16:35] Great, great potential.
- [16:37] But needs to be done the right way.
- [16:39] - Yep. Absolutely.
- And I contributed enough,
- [16:42] and this is, I think,
- [16:44] the most important outcome
- [16:45] that I've had from more than two decades
- [16:48] of implementing those technologies is
- [16:52] the companies that succeed
- [16:53] are only the ones that put the people
- [16:56] in the center
- [16:57] of their transformation.
- [16:59] So putting the people in the center, meaning
- [17:03] informing them, what does it mean?
- [17:05] What does it mean
- [17:06] to have this technology in
- [17:07] in the company?
- [17:08] What does it mean
- [17:08] to the roles of each of those people,
- [17:11] being transparent,
- [17:13] to them and, and specific to each people?
- [17:16] What does it mean for your role,
- [17:17] how it's going to transform?
- [17:21] And after information, it's about educating,
- [17:23] so basically giving the capacity
- [17:25] to those people to understand
- [17:27] what is this technology,
- [17:28] what they can expect from it
- [17:29] in terms of benefits,
- [17:31] and how they will implement it
- [17:33] in their own work.
- [17:35] It's all so real and present to you,
- [17:37] and I wonder how you're seeing it
- [17:40] play out across different organizations.
- [17:42] So at Microsoft
- [17:43] we tend to talk about frontier firms,
- [17:45] firms that are not necessarily
- [17:46] having to add this
- [17:47] after the fact and incorporate it
- [17:49] into older systems.
- [17:50] They are AI first
- [17:52] - Yes.
- who are struggling
- [17:52] to do exactly what you said,
- [17:54] pair their agents with their humans
- [17:57] and unlock
- [17:58] all of the efficiency and growth
- [17:59] that they're capable of.
- [18:00] Yes.
- [18:01] Are you seeing those
- [18:02] and can you talk about
- [18:03] their competitive advantage?
- [18:05] Definitely, I see those companies and
- [18:10] and in my view,
- [18:11] they share four key characteristics.
- [18:14] The first one is
- [18:15] they think beyond automation.
- [18:17] So instead of asking
- [18:19] “what can we automate”, they will ask,
- [18:21] “how can we reimagine our business,
- [18:23] so that
- [18:24] by taking advantage of this technology.”
- [18:27] okay, so it's not about
- [18:28] copying and pasting
- [18:29] what they are doing currently with humans
- [18:31] and giving it to agents,
- [18:32] but how can we reinvent
- [18:34] the way we do things?
- [18:36] So that's the first thing,
- [18:38] improve before even automating.
- [18:40] And think about the new ways of doing.
- [18:45] The second is they invest in
- [18:47] human technology collaboration.
- [18:49] And they don't just deploy agents,
- [18:50] they will redesign work
- [18:51] to optimize the collaboration
- [18:53] between human capabilities
- [18:54] and agent capabilities.
- [18:57] The third is they build agent ecosystems.
- [19:00] So rather than just isolated
- [19:02] point solutions, you know, that
- [19:04] keep in silos and and doesn't deliver
- [19:07] the high impact that we can expect,
- [19:09] they will create networks
- [19:10] of specialized agents
- [19:11] that can collaborate
- [19:12] and learn from the other,
- [19:13] the one from the other.
- [19:15] And finally,
- [19:15] and I think that's the most important,
- [19:17] and that's the reason why I think
- [19:18] all companies,
- [19:20] not only 80% but 100%, should be
- [19:24] thinking about
- [19:25] about those technologies
- [19:26] for their business.
- [19:27] It doesn't mean they need to implement it
- [19:29] at scale and right away,
- [19:30] but at least they need
- [19:32] to start their journey.
- [19:33] And we are talking here
- [19:34] about a journey.
- [19:35] It's not a one off transformation.
- [19:37] It's really about an ongoing
- [19:38] transformation that will never end,
- [19:40] because those technologies will
- [19:42] constantly sophisticate,
- [19:43] and companies
- [19:45] will be able to improve
- [19:47] the automations that they built, in time.
- [19:50] So this
- [19:51] this one is about building
- [19:53] what I call
- [19:53] compounding intelligence advantages.
- [19:56] So basically,
- [19:57] unlike the traditional technologies
- [19:59] that provide static benefits,
- [20:01] those AI agents, they learn
- [20:03] and they improve continuously.
- [20:05] So they create compounding
- [20:07] intelligence advantages.
- [20:11] So basically early adopters
- [20:12] don’t just get
- [20:14] temporary benefits,
- [20:15] the short term benefits
- [20:16] they can get from those technologies,
- [20:18] but they build also insurmountable
- [20:21] learning gaps over competitors
- [20:23] who are behind them.
- [20:26] So basically
- [20:26] the compound effect
- [20:28] is that each
- [20:29] agent interaction
- [20:30] creates data that improves
- [20:33] not just that specific agent,
- [20:35] but potentially entire agent ecosystems.
- [20:38] - Right.
- And organizations
- [20:40] that start early are building
- [20:41] competitive moats,
- [20:43] that become increasingly difficult
- [20:44] to replicate.
- [20:45] So basically it's
- [20:46] learning what you learn by starting
- [20:49] as soon as possible,
- [20:50] this kind of transformation,
- [20:52] not only by generating data
- [20:56] through your agents, but also by
- [20:58] getting your people accustomed,
- [21:02] and learn
- [21:03] how to work in hybrid digital teams,
- [21:06] how to manage, orchestrate those agents.
- [21:10] This is invaluable.
- [21:11] And that's a great advantage.
- [21:13] Absolutely.
- [21:14] On the market.
- [21:16] So, let's talk about
- [21:17] the human side of that then
- [21:18] for a minute,
- [21:19] I want to ask you much more about
- [21:22] agents and humans working in parallel,
- [21:23] but in
- [21:25] your other book,
- [21:26] or one of your other books,
- [21:27] - Yes.
- Irreplaceable,
- [21:28] you talk about this concept of “humics”,
- [21:30] - Yes.
- The kind of unique
- [21:32] things that humans can do that
- [21:33] machines cannot fully replicate.
- [21:36] Give us some examples of those skills
- [21:38] and talk about why they're
- [21:39] they're so important now,
- [21:40] because you mentioned that skepticism
- [21:42] that some people may have.
- [21:43] So the uniquely human abilities
- [21:46] that I called the “humics”,
- [21:49] are extremely important
- [21:50] because we've seen
- [21:52] over the last 50 years,
- [21:55] that AI exist, that we always think
- [21:59] that there are skills
- [22:00] that AI will never take.
- [22:03] And,
- [22:04] and I think the last one was creativity.
- [22:06] We thought
- [22:08] AI would not be as creative as humans,
- [22:10] and we see that those generative AI
- [22:13] technologies are getting there.
- [22:16] So what's remaining to us?
- [22:18] What what makes us human,
- [22:20] and how do we avoid being redundant
- [22:22] basically with this technology?
- [22:24] And that's the key question.
- [22:25] So to avoid being redundant,
- [22:27] we need to be as different as possible.
- [22:30] We need to find what is the human edge.
- [22:34] That technology will
- [22:36] never be able to achieve
- [22:37] as well as we do.
- [22:39] And that from my research,
- [22:42] I identified three uniquely human abilities
- [22:45] through three abilities
- [22:47] that, first of all,
- [22:49] AI will never be able to achieve
- [22:50] as well as we do.
- [22:51] And secondly,
- [22:52] that creates a
- [22:53] true complementarity between us
- [22:57] and the technology,
- [22:59] avoiding the redundance.
- [23:01] And I like to show it like this.
- [23:03] If this is our capability,
- [23:04] if this is AI capability,
- [23:06] if there is an overlap here like this,
- [23:08] we lose.
- [23:10] The overall area that I cover is,
- [23:13] is lost
- [23:14] in this redundant area.
- [23:17] But if we create something completely-
- [23:20] If you only hear the audio,
- [23:21] you should know that
- [23:21] he's making sort of a
- [23:23] hand-based Venn diagram.
- [23:25] Yes.
- [23:27] To avoid redundancy,
- [23:29] to create maximum value.
- [23:30] And, the uniquely human abilities,
- [23:33] based on the research
- [23:34] that I performed
- [23:35] and that,
- [23:35] that I present in the book
- [23:37] irreplaceable are three.
- [23:39] The first one is genuine creativity.
- [23:41] So basically
- [23:41] not just recombining existing ideas,
- [23:45] like a large language model can do,
- [23:47] but about generating
- [23:48] truly original ideas, based on our
- [23:53] uniquely human lived experience,
- [23:56] emotions, and personalities.
- [23:59] The second one is critical thinking,
- [24:01] and this goes
- [24:02] beyond data processing,
- [24:04] that AI is very good at,
- [24:06] it includes nuanced judgment,
- [24:07] questioning assumptions.
- [24:10] Basically, we need to be the kings of
- [24:12] asking the right questions.
- [24:13] It's about navigating
- [24:14] also the ethical complexities,
- [24:16] that only humans can understand
- [24:19] because authentically, they are
- [24:21] built by us.
- [24:22] Only “us” can build ethical values.
- [24:27] And the third one is social authenticity,
- [24:30] which is about building
- [24:32] deep and trust-based relationships
- [24:34] through genuine empathy,
- [24:37] communication, shared consciousness.
- [24:40] So something that AI can simulate
- [24:42] but will never be able
- [24:43] to authentically replicate.
- [24:46] So those three “humics”
- [24:50] are the most important
- [24:52] thing that we need to work on
- [24:54] for a few reasons.
- [24:55] The first one is
- [24:56] we were all born with them.
- [24:59] Okay.
- [24:59] So if  you go into a
- [25:03] in kindergarten,
- [25:04] you'll see the kids playing together.
- [25:06] They are playing,
- [25:07] they are building a castle in the sand,
- [25:10] so this is creativity in action.
- [25:12] They will have
- [25:14] they will discuss the rules of the game.
- [25:15] No, you should not do this.
- [25:16] You should not do that.
- [25:17] No, that's okay.
- [25:18] That's critical thinking in action.
- [25:21] And finally, they will-
- [25:24] When a newcomer is around,
- [25:27] they will say, “okay, come,
- [25:28] come and play with us!”
- [25:28] That's social authenticity in action.
- [25:30] So we were all born with them,
- [25:32] those three uniquely human abilities.
- [25:34] So we are all equal.
- [25:36] That's the second point,
- [25:37] we can all develop
- [25:39] and build them to the highest extent.
- [25:41] So those three uniquely human abilities
- [25:43] have also as a characteristic
- [25:45] that they can be built,
- [25:47] and there is no limit
- [25:49] to how much we can build,
- [25:51] we can boost our creativity, critical
- [25:53] thinking and social authenticity.
- [25:55] So then what happens as we start
- [25:57] to bring these two things together?
- [25:58] You have humans with these unique skills
- [26:00] that we will hopefully continue to develop,
- [26:01] and then agents.
- [26:03] And now they're on the same team
- [26:04] literally within a business.
- [26:06] What does that look like?
- [26:07] So it means two things.
- [26:10] First of all, to stay relevant,
- [26:12] we, and our team members,
- [26:15] need to build those humics,
- [26:18] to the highest extent.
- [26:19] because they-
- [26:20] with those humics,
- [26:21] we create the highest value with AI.
- [26:24] So don't only invest in the agents,
- [26:26] also invest in the training
- [26:27] and building up the human skills
- [26:29] - Exactly.
- so you don't
- [26:30] lose or disengage your employees.
- [26:31] Exactly. Thank you for that Molly.
- [26:33] That's exactly that.
- [26:36] and as we've seen,
- [26:37] this is also a way to create a value
- [26:39] that differentiates
- [26:42] your business from others.
- [26:43] Because in a few years from now,
- [26:46] AI will be a commodity.
- [26:49] When everyone uses the same AI,
- [26:52] everyone proposes the same services
- [26:54] in a way
- [26:55] and has the same capabilities,
- [26:57] the ones that will differentiate
- [26:58] from the others will be those
- [27:00] who are able to combine the right way,
- [27:02] those human capabilities
- [27:04] and those agent capabilities.
- [27:06] To create something that is different.
- [27:08] What you're describing
- [27:09] is also an interesting
- [27:10] management question.
- [27:12] So talk to me about the role of managers
- [27:14] who may now have a digital employee
- [27:17] and human employees
- [27:18] and get the best out of their agents
- [27:21] at the same time.
- [27:22] I mean, everyone is now becoming
- [27:26] a manager in a way.
- [27:27] Here is what I think
- [27:29] managers need to focus on.
- [27:30] So the best collaboration happens
- [27:32] when humans and agents have completely
- [27:35] different responsibilities.
- [27:38] And so humans focus on activities
- [27:40] that are driving core values
- [27:42] and requiring emotional intelligence
- [27:44] while the agents
- [27:45] handle research, routine tasks,
- [27:48] and process coordination.
- [27:50] So the managers
- [27:51] become more orchestrators,
- [27:52] you know, they,
- [27:53] they design human agent workflows.
- [27:57] So the focus shifts from
- [27:59] task assignment,
- [28:00] you do this,
- [28:01] you should do that,
- [28:02] to goal setting and boundary definition.
- [28:05] So basically
- [28:05] I give this work to this agent.
- [28:07] And I want it to achieve it
- [28:09] in these time constraints and these conditions.
- [28:12] So it's-
- [28:13] so now a key role of managers
- [28:16] is about building the trust between
- [28:19] their team members and the agents.
- [28:23] And this is where the value is created.
- [28:25] Basically, this is
- [28:26] where they will get the highest value.
- [28:29] How can they do that?
- [28:29] They can do that by creating clarity.
- [28:32] So clearly defining
- [28:34] what is the role of people and agents
- [28:37] and within people and agents
- [28:40] the role of each of them.
- [28:42] So the purpose here is to prevent
- [28:45] overlap and confusion.
- [28:47] Secondly, it's about
- [28:49] being very transparent.
- [28:50] So basically
- [28:52] everyone needs to understand
- [28:54] the capabilities
- [28:54] and limitations of the others.
- [28:56] Especially we as humans
- [28:58] need to understand
- [28:59] the capabilities
- [29:00] and limitations
- [29:01] of our digital colleagues.
- [29:03] And we all know that trust is earned.
- [29:06] It's not something
- [29:07] that happens overnight.
- [29:08] So something very important for leaders
- [29:11] is through a gradual collaboration.
- [29:14] Create this trust.
- [29:16] So first of all, ask your team members to
- [29:20] use an agent to do this specific task,
- [29:23] which is a small task
- [29:24] which is connect with clients.
- [29:26] Then when your team member
- [29:30] has built the trust and understands
- [29:34] what the agent is doing
- [29:35] and has been able to review
- [29:36] what it has been doing,
- [29:38] and understand that it is doing it well,
- [29:41] then increase it to the next step.
- [29:43] So not only
- [29:44] you connect to the client,
- [29:45] but you give it a document.
- [29:47] Okay.
- [29:47] So you gradually expand.
- [29:50] Baby steps.
- [29:51] Yeah. Baby steps.
- [29:54] Exactly this.
- [29:56] We as humans
- [29:57] need this gradual approach
- [29:59] in order to build trust.
- [30:01] We do this,
- [30:02] I mean, like, I have teenagers at home,
- [30:05] one of them is turning 16,
- [30:07] and she will want to drive my car.
- [30:09] I will not give the key like this.
- [30:11] Well, that's, that's okay.
- [30:13] So it's really about,
- [30:15] first of all,
- [30:15] she will not drive on the highway.
- [30:17] She will only drive around our home.
- [30:20] She will do it,
- [30:21] no more than one hour per day.
- [30:23] And then when trust will be built,
- [30:25] then I will,
- [30:27] I will hand over more.
- [30:29] And this is exactly what we need to do
- [30:31] with our team members as leaders.
- [30:33] It’s so-
- [30:34] That's so tactical and I love it.
- [30:35] And then you mentioned
- [30:36] another kind of key point
- [30:38] which is then measuring their success.
- [30:41] And that is-
- [30:42] I mean that is the key
- [30:43] to good management.
- [30:43] And I wonder how you think
- [30:44] about envisioning,
- [30:46] you know, KPIs and metrics for agents.
- [30:49] Yes. So,
- [30:52] I think we need a
- [30:52] comprehensive review of the metrics
- [30:55] for agents, but also for humans.
- [30:57] We need to review the the metrics
- [30:59] for humans
- [31:00] in the context of working
- [31:01] in the hybrid teams.
- [31:04] For example,
- [31:04] we want humans to incentivize them
- [31:08] to test more,
- [31:10] to try more, to fail more, basically,
- [31:14] in using those different technologies,
- [31:17] and spend more time trying them,
- [31:19] observing what's happening,
- [31:21] understanding what are the new opportunities
- [31:23] that are given to them,
- [31:25] automating part of their work,
- [31:28] but also focusing on
- [31:29] and building new skills,
- [31:33] in judgment, in creativity,
- [31:35] in I mean,
- [31:36] the skills that we talked about
- [31:37] that are uniquely human.
- [31:39] So we need
- [31:40] these metrics on the human side,
- [31:42] on the the agent side, we need,
- [31:46] we need to set up alerts.
- [31:48] We need to collect user feedback,
- [31:52] to understand if,
- [31:52] if they are doing things
- [31:54] well, we need to monitor
- [31:55] the decision quality
- [31:56] when they
- [31:57] when they make a decision understand
- [31:58] if they’ve done it the right way,
- [32:00] audit that and make sure that it happens
- [32:01] the right way.
- [32:03] But then on an overall
- [32:05] hybrid team metric,
- [32:08] I think it's very important to combine
- [32:11] qualitative and quantitative metrics.
- [32:13] So, you know, we are very often,
- [32:16] especially in the business context,
- [32:18] likely to focus on,
- [32:20] reducing cost, reducing time, reducing-
- [32:23] efficiency, basically productivity.
- [32:25] But we shouldn't keep out of sight.
- [32:28] The improvement
- [32:30] in customer experience,
- [32:31] in employee experience.
- [32:33] I mean, there's more
- [32:33] the satisfaction aspect
- [32:35] those more qualitative aspects.
- [32:36] So it's-
- [32:37] I think we need to have
- [32:39] the right combination of those metrics
- [32:41] with the qualitative and quantitative.
- [32:43] It's very important to have.
- [32:43] - It's funny
- [32:44] because you're describing sort of,
- [32:46] you know, we have agents
- [32:47] and humans working side by side.
- [32:49] And then we have machine type
- [32:50] metrics and human type metrics
- [32:52] side by side as well.
- [32:53] - Exactly.
- [32:54] - Let's talk about briefly
- [32:55] the change management
- [32:57] part of this and keeping up with
- [33:00] the rate of change.
- [33:00] It must be stressful
- [33:01] for you to write a book,
- [33:02] because so many things might change
- [33:05] in the time that the book comes out.
- [33:07] So how do leaders then
- [33:09] approach managing the fact
- [33:10] that the technology is changing
- [33:13] as they are trying to implement it,
- [33:15] almost out from under them?
- [33:17] I think we
- [33:19] we all need to build the three
- [33:21] competencies of the future,
- [33:23] the three competencies of the future
- [33:24] we already discussed about one
- [33:26] which is being human ready,
- [33:27] which is about building the
- [33:28] the uniquely human abilities.
- [33:30] The two other ones are
- [33:32] being change ready,
- [33:34] it is all about that,
- [33:36] the change the world-
- [33:37] I mean the change in our world
- [33:39] is accelerating. In magnitude, frequency,
- [33:43] and it's it's going to be even more
- [33:45] and more and more and we can feel it.
- [33:46] I think we have more information
- [33:48] coming to us,
- [33:49] new models coming every day
- [33:51] with new capabilities,
- [33:52] new characteristics.
- [33:53] So how do we identify the trivial
- [33:55] from the important things?
- [33:58] How do we filter this?
- [34:02] The third of the
- [34:04] three competencies
- [34:06] of the future is being AI-Ready.
- [34:09] And I think especially when we talk
- [34:10] about those technologies
- [34:11] and what they can bring to ourselves
- [34:12] and to our businesses,
- [34:14] it's about being able to identify
- [34:17] those technologies
- [34:19] that are worth being tested and used.
- [34:22] So basically identifying the ones that
- [34:25] could have meaning for me in my work
- [34:28] and in my life,
- [34:31] try them,
- [34:33] and because there is no other way
- [34:36] than to be hands-on
- [34:37] and and trying them to understand
- [34:39] really the benefits you can get.
- [34:43] And what does it mean?
- [34:44] It means that for us leaders, we need
- [34:47] to give this time to our team members.
- [34:49] So what I recommend is,
- [34:51] give our team members
- [34:52] about 20% of their working time to,
- [34:56] to be aware of what's happening,
- [35:00] what is coming out new in the AI world,
- [35:03] identifying what makes sense to them,
- [35:06] and then try those and fail, of course,
- [35:08] but sometimes succeed.
- [35:11] So- and it's not about any more-
- [35:13] And I think this is the new type
- [35:14] of education that we need
- [35:15] to give our teams.
- [35:17] It's not anymore
- [35:18] school, classroom type of training where,
- [35:22] as you said, anything that is true
- [35:24] today is will change in any way.
- [35:28] When the classroom program will
- [35:31] be, will be released,
- [35:32] it's going to be already outdated.
- [35:34] It's an AI literacy,
- [35:38] mindset that we need to give our teams
- [35:39] - Yeah.
mindset that we need to give our teams
- [35:40] mindset that we need to give our teams
- [35:41] and we need to give them this time,
- [35:43] this capacity to do that.
- [35:44] So basically they need to learn
- [35:46] how to do that,
- [35:47] and finally,
- [35:48] we need to incentivize them on that,
- [35:50] so basically reward them
- [35:52] because they've failed
- [35:53] because they've tried
- [35:53] because they've spent time and sometimes
- [35:56] and sometimes lost time
- [35:59] doing something, but
- [36:00] but it was worth trying it,
- [36:02] and that was great.
- [36:04] Right.
- [36:04] So it sounds like what you're saying is
- [36:06] start with your outcome.
- [36:07] Don't necessarily chase every new tool
- [36:09] that comes along.
- [36:10] Start with your outcome in mind,
- [36:12] but be willing to experiment
- [36:13] as an organization,
- [36:14] which is a really key point
- [36:15] to build in that flexibility and
- [36:17] and time.
- [36:18] Exactly. Exactly.
- [36:21] Okay.
- [36:21] You are so tactical
- [36:23] and specific, which I love,
- [36:24] and so this is a great chance to ask you,
- [36:28] let's say I'm a CEO,
- [36:29] and I am sold on this,
- [36:31] and I'm not sure how to get started.
- [36:33] You've given us,
- [36:34] you know, glimmers
- [36:35] of what you might say here,
- [36:36] but I wonder what is your
- [36:37] what is your blueprint
- [36:39] for starting this journey
- [36:40] and then getting it right?
- [36:42] First of all,
- [36:43] I think
- [36:44] I've never seen such
- [36:45] a transformation succeed.
- [36:47] If you don't have a clear
- [36:49] view from the top.
- [36:50] So the C-levels,
- [36:51] the board of directors or managers
- [36:54] of the company
- [36:55] need to have a certain vision of what
- [36:58] this technology will do
- [37:00] to transform the company.
- [37:01] And it's not here
- [37:02] about adapting technology
- [37:04] because of the sake of doing,
- [37:07] of using the latest shiny technology,
- [37:09] but really answering to use cases
- [37:12] to business issues that we need to solve
- [37:15] that is the first thing.
- [37:16] The second is,
- [37:18] investing in people and talents.
- [37:20] So basically
- [37:21] creating a- what I call
- [37:23] a center of excellence or,
- [37:24] or you can call it,
- [37:26] an AI talent group, or whatever.
- [37:30] It can be, first of all,
- [37:31] one person who knows those technologies
- [37:35] and who will launch this program,
- [37:40] under the mandate
- [37:41] from management and will help
- [37:45] the different functions
- [37:46] in the company to identify
- [37:47] different use cases,
- [37:49] collate all these together
- [37:51] and get back to management to understand
- [37:54] what is the level of
- [37:56] investment we are ready to
- [37:58] to give in the company
- [37:59] and build the business case,
- [38:01] basically to understand
- [38:02] what will be the profits
- [38:04] out of the transformation
- [38:06] that we can expect.
- [38:07] And finally,
- [38:08] this person will start building
- [38:10] the team of developers and technical
- [38:14] people who we will need to build this
- [38:17] and to implement this,
- [38:18] this transformation.
- [38:20] Investing in people is also,
- [38:22] as I said before, informing the people,
- [38:24] educating the people,
- [38:25] incentivizing them, empowering them,
- [38:27] by giving them
- [38:28] access to the right tools.
- [38:30] Yeah, I think those are the-
- [38:31] - That's great, I mean, that is-
- [38:34] - And I think
- [38:34] start small, and
- [38:36] but see big,
- [38:38] so it's really about starting with
- [38:42] a pilot that demonstrates
- [38:44] the capability of the technology
- [38:46] to serve the business
- [38:47] impact on the company and,
- [38:50] and give this enough visibility
- [38:51] so that it really
- [38:53] creates a dynamic in the company
- [38:54] and everyone wants to
- [38:57] to go with that.
- [38:58] To be part of it. I love it.
