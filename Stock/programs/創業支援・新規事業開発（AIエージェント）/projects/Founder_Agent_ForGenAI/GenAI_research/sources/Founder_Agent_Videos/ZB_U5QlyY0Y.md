- [00:00] Imagine an AI that doesn't just browse
- [00:02] the web, it controls it. An AI that can
- [00:05] scrape data, file JRO tickets, fill out
- [00:08] forms, trigger workflows, and even
- [00:11] automate complex 30inut research
- [00:13] projects, all within your own browser or
- [00:15] straight from the cloud. Well, allow me
- [00:18] to reintroduce Retriever, the next
- [00:20] evolution of the AI web agent, [music]
- [00:23] which has been now rebuilt from the
- [00:25] ground up with MCP, cloudscaling, and
- [00:28] multi- aent intelligence. Previously,
- [00:31] Retriever AI was only known for being a
- [00:33] powerful local first browser extension,
- [00:36] one that ran completely inside your own
- [00:38] Chrome browser. It let you automate
- [00:41] websites applied to jobs or collect data
- [00:44] securely [music] and privately all
- [00:46] without relying on external servers. But
- [00:49] with this new version 2 update,
- [00:51] Retriever takes a massive leap forward.
- [00:54] Now your browser itself becomes a remote
- [00:56] MCP server, meaning other apps and AI
- [01:00] agents can directly control your browser
- [01:02] remotely. For example, if you were to
- [01:04] tell Retriever to send a connection
- [01:06] request to Google CTO Jeff Dean, the
- [01:09] agent instantly understands and it's
- [01:11] able to open up LinkedIn in the
- [01:13] background, find a profile, and send the
- [01:15] request all within the browser using
- [01:18] credentials securely. This is because
- [01:20] Retriever runs locally and it can handle
- [01:23] websites that block cloud bots like
- [01:25] LinkedIn while still executing multiple
- [01:27] tasks in parallel across different tabs.
- [01:30] And the best part is is that you can
- [01:32] save that task as a shortcut and rerun
- [01:34] it instantly or scale the exact same
- [01:37] automation to the cloud with a single
- [01:39] click. Essentially, with Retriever
- [01:41] version two, your browser becomes a
- [01:43] remote MCP server and it's going to let
- [01:45] other apps and AI agents control it a
- [01:48] lot better. You can instantly scale any
- [01:50] automation to thousands of cloud
- [01:52] browsers and run multi- aent workflows
- [01:55] for 30 plus minutes using Google Sheets
- [01:57] as memory or you can even trigger
- [01:59] automations on the go through WhatsApp.
- [02:02] This is a new version that is going to
- [02:05] support a lot of new features with slash
- [02:07] commands, record and repeat task, and a
- [02:10] lot more which we're going to be
- [02:11] uncovering throughout today's video. And
- [02:13] a huge props to them for sponsoring
- [02:15] today's video. This is definitely a
- [02:17] great tool and I highly recommend that
- [02:19] you go ahead and upload them on product
- [02:21] hunt as they have just released this new
- [02:23] version today. But what sets Retriever
- [02:26] apart from other AI web agents is its
- [02:29] overall performance on various sorts of
- [02:31] benchmarks. On the web bench, it scored
- [02:33] an 81.39
- [02:35] percentage for its overall success rate.
- [02:38] It also is super fast with a blazing
- [02:40] fast 0.9 minute task completion and an
- [02:44] ultra low 12 cents per task cost. It is
- [02:48] something that also excels at both
- [02:50] reading and writing tasks. It
- [02:52] outperforms competitors like Open AI as
- [02:55] well as Enthropic. And it's a local
- [02:58] first architecture which avoids bot
- [03:00] detection. It reuses authenticated
- [03:02] sessions. It can even handle captas and
- [03:05] support multi-tab workflows. While
- [03:08] DOMbased intelligence is going to ensure
- [03:10] accurate interactions with complex web
- [03:12] pages, it's fast, it's reliable, and
- [03:15] it's costefficient, which is why I
- [03:17] really wanted to showcase it on the
- [03:19] channel. Before we get started, I just
- [03:21] want to mention that you should
- [03:22] definitely go ahead and subscribe to the
- [03:24] World of AI newsletter. I'm constantly
- [03:26] posting different newsletters on a
- [03:28] weekly basis. So, this is where you can
- [03:31] easily get up-to-date knowledge about
- [03:33] what is happening in the AI space. So,
- [03:35] definitely go ahead and subscribe as
- [03:37] this is completely for free. But let's
- [03:39] get started. You have three ways to
- [03:41] access it. First is through the WhatsApp
- [03:43] bot that lets you trigger automations
- [03:45] and fetch data directly from your phone.
- [03:48] And it's simply as just texting the bot.
- [03:51] You can also access it through the
- [03:52] Chrome extension, which is what we
- [03:54] showcased before as a remote MCP server,
- [03:57] which is going to let your AI agent
- [04:00] control your browser remotely. You also
- [04:02] have the cloud and API platform, which
- [04:04] we'll showcase. But to install it, you
- [04:07] can easily click on this button, which
- [04:08] will take you to the Chrome store, and
- [04:10] you can add this to Chrome as a single
- [04:13] click, and it will add the extension.
- [04:15] Once installed, you can then click on
- [04:17] the retriever extension. And this is
- [04:20] where you can now go ahead and create an
- [04:22] account or sign up using Google. It is
- [04:25] completely free to access and you can
- [04:27] even access a free API via Gemini.
- [04:30] But here is your AI web agent. You can
- [04:34] do almost anything from automating tasks
- [04:36] on the web, extracting data where you
- [04:38] can even automate data entry. You can
- [04:41] crawl different sorts of pages, create
- [04:43] docs, call APIs and MCPS as well as work
- [04:47] on different sheets. Now, to get
- [04:49] started, you can simply go ahead and
- [04:52] automate anything based off the natural
- [04:54] language prompt that you paste in. And
- [04:56] what you can also do is you can add
- [04:58] context based off the page that you want
- [05:00] to work on. So if you want it so that it
- [05:03] has context for my world of AI YouTube
- [05:05] channel page as well as my newsletter,
- [05:08] you can add that as context so that it
- [05:10] can simultaneously perform web-based
- [05:12] task across these two different pages
- [05:14] asynchronously. On the bottom, you can
- [05:17] click on teach a trick and this is
- [05:19] essentially where you can add in a new
- [05:21] recording to teach the AI web agent to
- [05:23] perform a task. What you can also do is
- [05:26] if you click on the MCP URL, this is
- [05:29] where you can copy a URL from retriever
- [05:31] so that you can connect your browser as
- [05:34] a tool to other AI agents or apps so
- [05:37] that it can control and let them trigger
- [05:39] real actions on your browser remotely.
- [05:42] Also, keep in mind you can use this
- [05:44] completely for free. This is the beauty
- [05:46] of Retriever because if you wanted to,
- [05:48] you can have it so that you can add in
- [05:50] your own API from Gemini and Gemini
- [05:53] offers a free API tier that you can use
- [05:56] on a daily basis. There's also different
- [05:58] tools that you can have your web agent
- [06:00] use from different MCP servers to user
- [06:03] tools like Slack messages. You can also
- [06:06] use system tools that are already
- [06:08] implemented within Chrome. You can add
- [06:11] in different sorts of files and you can
- [06:13] even attach Google Sheets. But now let's
- [06:15] test this out. I can go ahead and I can
- [06:17] request it to scrape the contents of my
- [06:19] YouTube channel page as well as my
- [06:21] newsletter. And I can scrape the data as
- [06:24] markdown. We can send in this prompt.
- [06:25] And you can see that it is going to
- [06:27] start off by analyzing the request. This
- [06:29] is where you can add in further guidance
- [06:32] or corrections if needed. But it's going
- [06:33] to now work on planning to execute this
- [06:36] task. And you can see that the agentic
- [06:39] tabs right now are this uh YouTube
- [06:42] channel link as well as the newsletter
- [06:44] link. And quite rapidly it was able to
- [06:46] do a great job in extracting all the
- [06:48] contents. You can see all of the YouTube
- [06:51] links that it was able to extract from
- [06:53] my YouTube channel and it was able to
- [06:56] also extract the link the total views as
- [06:58] well as the upload date. And at that
- [07:01] bottom it also is showcasing the summary
- [07:05] it got from the newsletter. Talks about
- [07:07] all the new posts I have on newsletter
- [07:10] and it has extracted all the contents
- [07:12] for it. And you can see that this was
- [07:14] something that it was able to do quite
- [07:16] rapidly. You can share this task. You
- [07:18] can copy the messages and you can even
- [07:20] create a shortcut for this task to be
- [07:22] rerun in the future. And like how you
- [07:25] can access the extension for free, you
- [07:27] can also access the cloud platform. This
- [07:30] is essentially where you can automate
- [07:32] and
- [07:35] this is essentially where imagine you
- [07:37] are able to take any automation you
- [07:39] built locally and instantly scale it to
- [07:41] thousands of browsers. This is where you
- [07:44] can simply extract website datas at
- [07:46] scale. You can process spreadsheets at
- [07:48] scale and automate any workflow at
- [07:51] scale. It is something that you can
- [07:53] simply describe in natural language and
- [07:54] you can execute it rapidly with the
- [07:57] flashlight, the flash model or even a
- [07:59] pro model. You can set a default proxy.
- [08:03] You can also add in tools like you would
- [08:05] with extension. This is where I can
- [08:06] execute a task of extracting contents
- [08:09] off of angel.co co finding different
- [08:12] sorts of AI startups founded after 2023
- [08:15] having it precisely execute this task
- [08:18] that is very detailed scrolled until all
- [08:21] the results are loaded and then extract
- [08:22] each company name description location
- [08:25] and a couple of other fields and I can
- [08:28] simply go ahead and request this task to
- [08:30] be completed but the beauty of this is
- [08:32] that you can scale it to a thousands of
- [08:34] browsers in the cloud with a single
- [08:36] prompt that's exactly what the retriever
- [08:38] cloud does it can turn your local
- [08:40] workflow into a production ready
- [08:42] automation that can run in parallel
- [08:44] across massive cloud infrastructure and
- [08:46] it's going to give you supercharged
- [08:48] scale speed and reliability and you can
- [08:51] see it was quite rapidly able to extract
- [08:53] all the contents and now we can open it
- [08:55] up in a Google sheet. This is where we
- [08:58] have the parent website you have the
- [09:01] source website location tagline
- [09:03] industries and all the different fields
- [09:05] that we had requested fully scraped.
- [09:08] This is the beauty of retriever. In the
- [09:10] same manner, you can do a lot more at
- [09:13] scale with the cloud version, but you
- [09:16] have a good hybrid approach of using
- [09:18] retriever with obviously with the
- [09:19] extension as well as the cloud if
- [09:22] needed. But this is the new update of
- [09:24] retriever that makes AI web automation a
- [09:27] lot easier. I'll leave all these links
- [09:29] in the description below so that you can
- [09:31] get started right away. But with that
- [09:33] thought, guys, thank you guys so much
- [09:34] for watching. I hope you enjoyed today's
- [09:35] video and got some sort of value out of
- [09:37] it. This is, in my opinion, one of the
- [09:39] best AI web agents available, and I
- [09:42] highly recommend that you take a look at
- [09:43] it with the links in the description
- [09:44] below. But with that thought, make sure
- [09:46] you go ahead and join the newsletter,
- [09:47] join our private Discord, follow me on
- [09:50] Twitter, and lastly, make sure you guys
- [09:52] subscribe, turn on notification bell,
- [09:53] like this video, and please take a look
- [09:54] at our previous videos because there's a
- [09:56] lot of content [music] that you will
- [09:57] truly benefit from. But with that
- [09:58] thought, guys, have an amazing day,
- [10:00] spread positivity, and I'll see you guys
- [10:01] really shortly. He suffers.
