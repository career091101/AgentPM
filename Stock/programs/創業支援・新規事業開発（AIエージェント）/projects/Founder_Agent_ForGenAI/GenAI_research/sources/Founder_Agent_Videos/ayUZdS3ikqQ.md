- [00:00] If you're still using chat GPT, then
- [00:02] honestly you're falling behind. In the
- [00:05] past few months, there have been some
- [00:06] insane AI platforms that have been
- [00:08] released that honestly completely blow
- [00:10] Chat GPT out of the water. Now, in this
- [00:13] video, I'm going to show you one of
- [00:14] those called GenSpark. What I'm going to
- [00:16] do exactly in this video is give you a
- [00:18] tutorial, show you how it works, and
- [00:20] walk you through some use cases that you
- [00:22] can copy directly for yourself.
- [00:25] Specifically, we're going to have a look
- [00:26] at things like AI slides, AI developer,
- [00:30] AI designer, AI sheets, or kind of like
- [00:32] AI Google Sheets or Excel, and then even
- [00:34] how to generate an AI podcast. There's a
- [00:37] lot of other things that you can do with
- [00:38] this tool, but these I think will
- [00:40] highlight kind of the diverse
- [00:41] capabilities and then you can see for
- [00:43] yourself how you want to use it and how
- [00:45] you can get the most productivity out of
- [00:47] it. So, with that said, let's go over to
- [00:49] the computer and let me show you how
- [00:50] this works. All right, so I'm inside of
- [00:52] the GenSpark workspace here, and I'm
- [00:54] just going to go over kind of a
- [00:55] high-level view of the UI and some of
- [00:57] the features that it has, and then we'll
- [00:59] get into those different use cases that
- [01:01] I mentioned. Now, you can access this by
- [01:03] simply going to genpark.ai
- [01:05] or you can click the link in the
- [01:07] description and get access to some free
- [01:08] credits so you can evaluate the tool
- [01:10] because I did partner with GenSpark for
- [01:12] this video. Now, a few things that you
- [01:14] should know about this platform is that
- [01:16] this was built by 30 people, which is
- [01:18] not a lot. And in just 6 months, this
- [01:21] business hit a $1 billion valuation,
- [01:24] which is honestly ridiculous, even in
- [01:26] Silicon Valley. And you're going to see
- [01:27] why in this video, because of all of the
- [01:29] capabilities that this has. Now, in
- [01:32] terms of pricing, cuz I know a lot of
- [01:33] you will ask that. This is $20 per month
- [01:35] if you pay annually or $25 per month if
- [01:38] you pay on a monthly basis. And this
- [01:41] replaces a significant amount of the AI
- [01:43] tools that you probably already use. So
- [01:45] you have access to GPT models, Gemini
- [01:48] models, image and video generation
- [01:50] models, etc., etc. Even as you can see
- [01:52] on screen here, you have unlimited use
- [01:54] of Nano Banana Pro, which a lot of
- [01:56] people have been going on about
- [01:57] recently. And you're going to see why
- [01:59] this is probably worth using because it
- [02:01] combines all of the tools you probably
- [02:03] pay for separately and have in different
- [02:05] windows in one. Okay, so let's quickly
- [02:08] go through the UI. First thing you'll
- [02:09] notice is that this is kind of like the
- [02:11] general agent view here. So you can just
- [02:13] ask this something like you would ask
- [02:14] chatgpt and then it can connect to
- [02:16] various integrations. So I have it
- [02:18] connected to my Gmail, Google drive,
- [02:20] Google calendar and notion. And if you
- [02:22] go here you'll see there's a bunch of
- [02:24] other ones you can connect to as well
- [02:25] like Slack, One Drive, etc. You also can
- [02:28] have all of these different MCP servers.
- [02:30] You can see there is a ton or you can
- [02:33] add your own. Now, the interesting thing
- [02:35] about GenSpark, at least in my opinion,
- [02:37] is the use of the AI drive and kind of
- [02:40] the hub or like workspace. So, you'll
- [02:42] see here that there's a huge list of
- [02:44] files that I've been using within
- [02:46] GenSpark that are automatically
- [02:47] downloaded and saved for me. You can see
- [02:50] it's actually organized them into
- [02:51] folders. And what I like about this is
- [02:53] that I don't need to just keep dragging
- [02:54] and dropping different files and
- [02:56] referencing stuff from my own Google
- [02:58] Drive or my own file system. It all just
- [03:00] gets stored directly inside of here. And
- [03:02] I also can go to my hub and I can
- [03:05] organize various different files into
- [03:07] kind of separate hubs or workspaces. So
- [03:09] if I'm working with coding or if I'm
- [03:11] working with my YouTube channel or legal
- [03:12] accounting, etc., I can keep that
- [03:14] organized and then directly reference
- [03:16] that inside of my chats. Lastly, we also
- [03:19] have the AI inbox, which I think is a
- [03:21] useful feature. I've just connected this
- [03:22] to my Dev Launch email. So because of
- [03:25] that, GenSpark will have direct access
- [03:27] to the email. It will be able to see all
- [03:29] of the different stuff that is coming
- [03:30] in. It can reply to the emails directly.
- [03:33] You guys get the idea. So I can even
- [03:35] just reference new email here and I can
- [03:36] use AI to generate that of course. Okay.
- [03:39] So let's go back here to home. I just
- [03:41] want to quickly show you kind of the
- [03:43] basic agent usage and then we'll get
- [03:45] into those different workflows that I
- [03:46] mentioned. So first I'm just going to
- [03:47] say can you read my recent emails and
- [03:52] give me any action items? Okay. So let's
- [03:56] go ahead and do that and see the
- [03:58] response that we get. Okay. Okay, so you
- [03:59] can see that after doing that, I was
- [04:00] able to read through some of my emails
- [04:02] and then came up with a task list. I
- [04:04] don't want to show you the other ones
- [04:05] because these are kind of personal and I
- [04:07] can't really leak that information. But
- [04:08] for example, you can see that I'm
- [04:10] working on like two new YouTube videos
- [04:11] and I had a call with someone from image
- [04:13] kit because it's a really cool uh kind
- [04:15] of module that we're going to be using
- [04:16] and we're kind of talking about what we
- [04:18] need to do in the timeline, action
- [04:19] items, etc. So just quick kind of simple
- [04:21] usage of Super Age and of course it can
- [04:23] do a lot of other stuff. We wanted to
- [04:25] show you that's like the most basic way
- [04:27] you could use this platform. So now I
- [04:29] want to start walking through that flow
- [04:31] that I talked about before. What I'm
- [04:33] going to do is go to plus and I'm going
- [04:35] to go to AI slides. You'll see there's a
- [04:37] bunch of other options here. Feel free
- [04:39] to explore them on your own. But let's
- [04:40] click on AI slides and see what we can
- [04:42] generate here. Okay. So when we do that,
- [04:44] it's going to bring up a bunch of
- [04:45] different templates. If there's one that
- [04:47] catches our eye, we can select that and
- [04:49] then we can just give this kind of a
- [04:50] prompt on what we want it to create. So
- [04:52] let me do that and let me show you a
- [04:53] finished kind of presentation. All
- [04:55] right. So what I've done here is I've
- [04:56] taken a document that I had that is just
- [04:58] a bunch of information about my dev
- [05:00] launch program and I've just told it hey
- [05:02] you know create a PowerPoint slide for
- [05:04] this. I dumped all of the data and then
- [05:06] it started actually creating an outline
- [05:08] for the document and then generating the
- [05:10] slides using HTML and CSS. So it's
- [05:13] pretty interesting the way that it does
- [05:14] this. It actually writes code for every
- [05:16] single slide with all of the custom
- [05:19] styling which allows it to make
- [05:20] something really unique and not just
- [05:22] follow kind of like a preset template.
- [05:24] So you can see we have you know dev
- [05:25] launch the fourmonth career accelerator.
- [05:28] All the slides are pretty unique and
- [05:29] different and we can kind of scroll
- [05:31] through it and see everything that it's
- [05:33] generated. Now we also have all these
- [05:35] different save points. So I can go back
- [05:37] to previous stages. I can view the code.
- [05:39] I can view the thinking and then if I
- [05:41] want to make any adjustments to this I
- [05:43] can by simply using some of the buttons
- [05:45] that we have here just directly talking
- [05:47] inside of the chat. I also can save it
- [05:49] to notion export it etc. So, for
- [05:52] example, let's go with kind of AIedit
- [05:54] here. Let's just press on polish
- [05:56] content. When we do that, it's just
- [05:58] going to automatically make this look a
- [06:00] little bit nicer. But if we wanted to,
- [06:01] like you saw, we could tell it directly
- [06:03] the changes we wanted it to make. Okay,
- [06:05] so it's in the middle of doing this
- [06:06] optimization. And you can see that it
- [06:08] now obviously looks a lot better. It's
- [06:09] created some icons here. And I just want
- [06:11] to show you that what it actually ends
- [06:13] up doing is it takes a screenshot of the
- [06:15] slide to see what it looks like and then
- [06:17] validates that this is what it was going
- [06:19] for. And if it didn't get the correct
- [06:21] result, then it regenerates it again. So
- [06:23] you can see I'll take a screenshot of
- [06:25] the enhanced visual presentation. It did
- [06:27] that and then was okay. Yes, this looks
- [06:28] good. You know, we don't need to go any
- [06:30] further. We're good to go. Okay, so
- [06:32] that's it from the slides. Now, if I
- [06:34] wanted to actually use this, I can
- [06:35] simply export it. So I'll just go to the
- [06:37] export button. From here, it actually
- [06:39] brings me into another view where I can,
- [06:41] of course, download as PDF, you know,
- [06:43] PowerPoint, Google Slides, but I also
- [06:45] can just directly view the slides here
- [06:47] and play them. So I can kind of have
- [06:48] like this what do you call it? I don't
- [06:50] know slideshow viewer directly in my
- [06:52] browser which I think is pretty
- [06:54] interesting and is still on the Gen
- [06:55] Spark domain. Okay, so that's it for the
- [06:58] AI slides. Let's go back here and now
- [07:01] let's go and have a look at the AI
- [07:03] developer which I think for a lot of you
- [07:04] will be a bit more interesting. Okay, so
- [07:06] when you click into the AI developer,
- [07:08] the first thing it's going to show you
- [07:09] is a few different options in terms of
- [07:11] what app you want to create. You can
- [07:13] make a simple landing page. You can make
- [07:14] a full stack app. You can use an
- [07:16] existing GitHub project. In our case,
- [07:18] I'm going to go with a full stack
- [07:19] application. And actually, what I want
- [07:21] to create here is a language learning
- [07:24] application that has accounts, progress
- [07:26] tracking, list of words, flashcards, and
- [07:29] I want this to help me learn Bahasa
- [07:31] Indonesia. Now, the reason for that is
- [07:33] I'm currently in Indonesia. I'm actually
- [07:35] in Bali, if you can tell by my kind of
- [07:36] new background here, and I've been
- [07:38] slowly kind of learning the language.
- [07:40] It's pretty easy one to learn. So, I
- [07:41] think that's an interesting enough and
- [07:43] kind of small enough demo that we could
- [07:45] build here. So, I'll write it a quick
- [07:47] prompt. I'll actually use Super Agent to
- [07:49] help me come up with the outline and
- [07:50] then we'll see what it can create for
- [07:52] us. Okay, so let's go ahead and do that
- [07:53] full stack app start building and go
- [07:55] from there. All right, so it's been a
- [07:56] few minutes here. You can see that this
- [07:58] is the prompt that I ended up with.
- [08:00] Again, what I did is I kind of just
- [08:01] shared my thoughts on what I was looking
- [08:03] for to Super Agent and then created a
- [08:05] much more detailed outline for me. I
- [08:07] just dumped that here into the AI
- [08:09] developer and then a few prompts later
- [08:11] as I did a few small tweaks it actually
- [08:13] generated this entire website for us.
- [08:16] Now from here we can view all of the
- [08:17] code. So I can directly go into any of
- [08:19] the files. In this case it's like with
- [08:21] React and TypeScript and I could adjust
- [08:23] any of the code myself. So like I could
- [08:24] actually write directly inside of here.
- [08:26] I can connect it to GitHub. I can deploy
- [08:28] it. I can publish it right on the site.
- [08:31] And the interesting thing about this is
- [08:32] that it really does lower the barrier to
- [08:35] entry to getting something out quickly.
- [08:37] So while this isn't going to be used
- [08:38] for, you know, super largecale
- [08:40] enterprise software, if you're just
- [08:41] trying to create an MVP, a proof of
- [08:43] concept, get something out fast, and
- [08:45] also have all of the deployment handled
- [08:47] for you, I find that this works
- [08:49] extremely well. And then if you want it
- [08:50] to get a bit more complex, you can pull
- [08:52] this down with GitHub, load it up in
- [08:54] your own local IDE, and do more of the
- [08:57] complex kind of work and integrations
- [08:59] there. But in my case, I didn't really
- [09:00] have to do any manual intervention. You
- [09:03] can see that it's actually able to
- [09:04] create the database. It's creating
- [09:05] indexes for me. It can run npm commands.
- [09:08] It can seed the database. I was pretty
- [09:10] impressed with what it was able to
- [09:12] generate again with like two single
- [09:14] prompts in about 15 minutes. So, what
- [09:16] we'll do is open up the finished
- [09:17] website. Uh we can see that it ended up
- [09:19] naming this Bahasa cards. What I can do
- [09:22] is log in. So, let me log into my
- [09:24] account. Okay. And we can see that I've
- [09:25] logged in here. we have uh some
- [09:28] information on like our progress. So,
- [09:29] you know, words learned, due today,
- [09:31] reviews today, etc. I can click into one
- [09:34] of these different kind of decks and
- [09:36] then it will start showing me different
- [09:37] words. So, hello in Indonesian. That's
- [09:39] hello. Okay, so I'm going to go good.
- [09:41] Yes, I knew that one. Sat pagi I think
- [09:43] is like good morning or something. Yes,
- [09:45] good morning. Okay, perfect. Let's mark
- [09:46] that as easy. Salamat sang. I'm not sure
- [09:49] what that is. Maybe like good day or
- [09:52] something. Good afternoon. Okay, I'm
- [09:53] going to go. I didn't know that one. So,
- [09:54] we'll do that one again later. And you
- [09:56] get the idea, right? We kind of have
- [09:57] flashcards popping up. We can see the
- [09:59] progress. We can track all of the stuff
- [10:01] that we've done. We can start our
- [10:03] review. And we can also browse through
- [10:04] various categories. So, for example, I
- [10:06] can view words related to like family. I
- [10:09] can view words like for the greetings.
- [10:11] And I know it seems pretty basic, but
- [10:12] for 15 minutes to create this full
- [10:14] application, have authentication, have
- [10:17] an API, have a seated database, have a
- [10:19] full dashboard that works, and have
- [10:21] practically no bugs, at least from what
- [10:22] I can see right now, is pretty
- [10:24] impressive. And if I wanted to spend
- [10:25] some more time on this, I think I could
- [10:27] create a pretty interesting application
- [10:29] that actually has a lot of capabilities.
- [10:31] So, let's go back here to the UI. You
- [10:33] also see that we have various scripts
- [10:35] that we can use, a full tutorial on how
- [10:37] this actually works and how we could
- [10:39] deploy it out using Cloudflare. And then
- [10:41] we can even view the metrics or various
- [10:43] AI integrations. So if we wanted to have
- [10:45] for example like an AI learning
- [10:47] assistant directly on this site rather
- [10:49] than us having to handle all the API
- [10:51] keys ourself, we can do that directly
- [10:53] with GenSpark where we can access the
- [10:55] GPT5 models and it can handle the keys
- [10:57] for us. For example, I can generate the
- [10:59] key here and then it can just be used
- [11:00] directly in our application with all of
- [11:02] the deployment and security handled
- [11:04] which I think is quite interesting.
- [11:06] Again, not designed to replace a
- [11:07] developer, but really to get something
- [11:09] out extremely quickly and more
- [11:11] importantly, handle the deployment of
- [11:13] the app, which is typically the tricky
- [11:15] thing to do, especially with kind of
- [11:16] vibecoded applications. So, that is the
- [11:18] AI developer. Now, let's go over to our
- [11:21] AI designer. So, the AI designer is
- [11:23] pretty straightforward. You can create
- [11:25] pretty much anything that you want. You
- [11:27] can attach reference images. You can use
- [11:29] an example. So, like see if we go to
- [11:31] social media, maybe we like one of these
- [11:33] templates. We can just click it and we
- [11:35] can start working. based off that
- [11:36] directly or we can just ask the AI to
- [11:38] just generate pretty much whatever we
- [11:40] want. So, what I'm going to do is just
- [11:42] show you a few examples of some things
- [11:43] that I've generated with this designer
- [11:45] so you can see kind of what's possible.
- [11:47] Okay. So, here's a quick example where I
- [11:49] just uploaded a bunch of images of
- [11:51] myself kind of in Dubai where I was like
- [11:53] renting a car, going to the Palm, etc.
- [11:55] And I told it, you know, create a
- [11:56] montage of these images for social media
- [11:58] with AI edits and artifacts that have
- [12:00] the caption of like, you know, day in
- [12:02] the UAE. And you can see that it's
- [12:04] created one vertical for me. It's
- [12:05] created kind of a square one. It's
- [12:07] created like a thumbnail image, created
- [12:08] another vertical one. All a little bit
- [12:10] different. But it's even done things
- [12:12] like Photoshop the Burj Khalifa in the
- [12:14] background of this image where it's not
- [12:15] originally in that image. And it's what
- [12:17] I don't know what's in the background
- [12:18] there, but it's not Burj Khalifa. You
- [12:20] can see it's selected kind of unique
- [12:21] images rather than the same one over and
- [12:23] over again. It's given me these cool
- [12:25] kind of AI artifacts like futuristic
- [12:28] look. Giving me the caption. And then if
- [12:30] we scroll down and see how this actually
- [12:32] worked, it was understanding the images
- [12:34] that we uploaded and then also looking
- [12:36] for a bunch of reference images for kind
- [12:38] of like the AI artifacts to be able to
- [12:40] generate this. Now, if I didn't like
- [12:42] this for some reason, I can just click
- [12:44] on it. I can do an AI edit. I can
- [12:46] directly highlight something I want to
- [12:47] change. I can add elements. I can remove
- [12:50] the background. I can erase something. I
- [12:52] can redraw. So, for example, maybe we
- [12:54] want to erase something. Let's try this.
- [12:56] And maybe let's like erase me here in
- [12:59] the corner and see if it's able to do
- [13:01] that. So, let's go apply and see if it
- [13:03] can just kind of pull me out of that
- [13:04] image. And there we go. We can see that
- [13:06] it just removed me and then it's filled
- [13:07] in the background to make it look kind
- [13:09] of natural. Let's like zoom this in a
- [13:11] little bit maybe so we can see it a bit
- [13:13] better. And you'll notice that it
- [13:15] doesn't even look like anything was ever
- [13:17] there. And it was able to really easily
- [13:18] remove me, which I think is a pretty
- [13:20] cool feature to be honest that I haven't
- [13:22] seen work that well in a lot of the
- [13:24] other AI. Let's just move this over a
- [13:25] bit and kind of zoom in. And again, we
- [13:27] could play with these images and do
- [13:28] really anything that we want. Now, let
- [13:31] me show you a quick other example of
- [13:32] something I use the AI designer for.
- [13:34] Okay, so here's a quick example just
- [13:36] loading up where I asked it to actually
- [13:38] generate a 50% off banner for my Dev
- [13:40] Launch resource vault. I didn't give it
- [13:42] any reference images and you can see
- [13:44] that it was able to generate a bunch of
- [13:45] kind of examples here with different
- [13:47] themes. What I then did is I looked at
- [13:49] this one, which I thought was kind of
- [13:51] most on brand, and I told it, hey, I
- [13:53] want to make it in kind of this new
- [13:55] color theme that matches the actual Dev
- [13:57] Launch color theme. So, you can see this
- [13:59] is the new one it was able to create.
- [14:01] And it did that by, if we can see the
- [14:03] prompt here, you know, please redesign
- [14:04] as requested. And I had simply pressed
- [14:06] on this, gone with the AI edit, uploaded
- [14:09] a new reference image, which you can see
- [14:11] right here, and said, you know, use this
- [14:12] as a color reference and kind of change
- [14:14] it to be this like orangey kind of gray
- [14:17] color theme, which it was able to
- [14:18] achieve. And then for all the text
- [14:20] elements, we could just directly
- [14:21] reference them, which makes that pretty
- [14:22] easy. Uh, so that it's not going to get
- [14:24] those incorrect. Overall, quite
- [14:26] valuable. I'm not someone who needs a
- [14:28] lot of design stuff, so I'm not the best
- [14:29] to demo this particular feature, but I
- [14:31] wanted to show you that it has all kinds
- [14:32] of capabilities when it comes to image
- [14:34] generation and design cuz I know a lot
- [14:36] of you find that interesting. Okay, so
- [14:38] now we're moving on to the AI sheets,
- [14:40] which is a super cool feature that they
- [14:42] have. To access it, you just go new,
- [14:44] press on AI sheets. You can see it's a
- [14:45] new feature here. And what you're able
- [14:47] to do is actually start using AI
- [14:50] directly inside of kind of Google Sheets
- [14:52] or Excel to create any kind of sheet
- [14:54] that you want. So you can see that we
- [14:56] just have a blank sheet here, but I also
- [14:58] can just upload a sheet and have it
- [14:59] loaded directly inside of this, or I can
- [15:02] have it just generate something
- [15:03] completely from scratch. So what I've
- [15:05] had to do in the past is I've had to
- [15:07] have a Google sheet for like attendance
- [15:09] tracking for my students in group calls.
- [15:12] It was very annoying and difficult to
- [15:13] create that sheet. So what I'm going to
- [15:15] do is I'm going to see if the AI can
- [15:17] actually generate that automatically for
- [15:19] me. I'll go through a few prompts and
- [15:21] kind of bring you along and let's see
- [15:22] what the finished product looks like.
- [15:24] So, it's been a few minutes here. I
- [15:26] started by just asking it to create a
- [15:28] new sheet that can track the attendance
- [15:29] of students during group calls. And then
- [15:31] you'll see what it did is I had it
- [15:33] actually just randomly generate some
- [15:35] student data as well. We have all of the
- [15:37] kind of information about the students
- [15:38] attendance percentages, how many calls
- [15:40] they were absent for, present for. We
- [15:42] have a call history summary, which isn't
- [15:44] quite finished yet that I need to get it
- [15:45] to complete. We have an attendance form,
- [15:48] which allows me to enter the data and
- [15:49] have it automatically added to the
- [15:51] correct sheet. We have, let's go back
- [15:53] here, the student roster where we list
- [15:55] out all of the different students. And
- [15:57] then we have the call log where all of
- [15:59] this information gets actually tallied
- [16:01] up and logged in that dashboard that you
- [16:03] saw before. So overall, pretty cool.
- [16:06] Now, just to show you kind of how this
- [16:08] works, I can do something like make this
- [16:11] look a lot nicer and add some graphs or
- [16:16] something. Okay. and let's see what it's
- [16:18] able to do now inside of the sheet with
- [16:21] all of the data that exists. Okay, so
- [16:22] it's still in the process of doing this,
- [16:24] but you can see that it started
- [16:25] generating a few different charts for me
- [16:27] inside of the dashboard. Uh if we look
- [16:29] at the student roster and the call,
- [16:32] okay, it doesn't look like anything's
- [16:33] changed there, but at least in the
- [16:35] dashboard, it's given us kind of this
- [16:36] new information and you can see that we
- [16:38] have like kind of the nice styling,
- [16:40] changed some of the colors, etc., etc.
- [16:42] So, I'm not going to wait for it to
- [16:43] fully finish, but just trying to show
- [16:44] you that it can do this. Obviously, the
- [16:46] more specific you are, the better
- [16:48] results you're going to get. But
- [16:49] overall, I think this is pretty cool and
- [16:51] it would have saved me a massive amount
- [16:52] of time when I was trying to build a
- [16:54] tool like this previously doing it by
- [16:56] hand manually. So, with that said, now
- [16:58] let's move on to look at the AI podcast
- [17:01] feature, which is pretty unique. Okay,
- [17:02] so to get here, you go new and then go
- [17:05] to AI. Where is it? AI pods over here.
- [17:08] This allows you to generate a podcast
- [17:10] about anything. You can be as specific
- [17:13] or as vague as you want. You can give it
- [17:15] the entire script. You can tell it to do
- [17:17] research. You can tell it the voice, the
- [17:18] style, etc. So, I already generated one
- [17:21] because it does take a few minutes to do
- [17:23] this. So, what I'm going to do is show
- [17:24] you that finished result that I've not
- [17:26] yet listened to. And let's see what we
- [17:28] actually get.
- [17:30] Okay. So, here is kind of the podcast
- [17:32] view. We can see the script that was
- [17:34] generated. And let me show you the
- [17:36] original prompt. So, what I said is
- [17:38] create a super simple podcast in the
- [17:39] style of Tech with Tim where he answers
- [17:41] questions about AI from a female guest.
- [17:44] have the guest ask questions related to
- [17:45] the future of developers due to the
- [17:47] increase in AI. And you can see that it
- [17:49] did some research, looked up information
- [17:51] about myself as well as AI, generated a
- [17:54] GPT kind of thumbnail for us for the
- [17:56] podcast, and then made the entire
- [17:58] script, and then had the voice for that.
- [18:00] So, let's see what this sounds like.
- [18:02] Again, I've not yet listened to it. Just
- [18:04] go back so that it's at the very
- [18:05] beginning, and let's see what we get.
- [18:09] What's up, everybody, and welcome back
- [18:10] to Tech with Tim. Today I'm I'm really
- [18:14] excited to be joined by a special guest,
- [18:16] Maya.
- [18:16] >> Hey.
- [18:17] >> She's a fantastic developer who's, you
- [18:19] know, deep in the trenches building cool
- [18:20] stuff. Welcome, Maya.
- [18:21] >> Hey, Tim. Happy to be here and and
- [18:23] honestly a little nervous about what
- [18:24] we're talking about today.
- [18:25] >> Yeah, we're diving straight into the
- [18:27] deep end. The big scary question. Is AI
- [18:29] going to make developers obsolete?
- [18:30] >> Right.
- [18:31] >> Okay. So, I think that's enough. I'm not
- [18:32] going to listen to the whole thing and
- [18:33] bore you, but overall sounds pretty
- [18:36] fluent and natural. I'm not sure if
- [18:38] you'd really be able to even determine
- [18:39] if that is AI or not, especially kind of
- [18:42] based on what it's saying. It sounds
- [18:44] like not really robotic. It has the ums,
- [18:46] the a slowing kind of the cadence down.
- [18:48] So, pretty cool. And then if I want, of
- [18:50] course, I can export the audio by just
- [18:52] pressing that button and I can save that
- [18:54] directly in the AI drive, which I've
- [18:56] done right here, and then reference it
- [18:57] or use it later. Now, in terms of other
- [19:00] features here in Gen Spark, you can do
- [19:02] video generation, fact-checking, deep
- [19:04] research, photo genius, clip genius.
- [19:06] There's all kinds of stuff that it has,
- [19:07] and even just the general super agent
- [19:09] itself is extremely useful. And I think
- [19:12] with that said, I'm going to wrap up the
- [19:14] video here. Overall, this platform is
- [19:16] very impressive. The number one thing
- [19:18] for me is that everything is in one
- [19:20] place. Having that AI drive component
- [19:22] really does make it a lot easier and
- [19:24] give you a lot of efficiency and
- [19:26] productivity benefits, which is why I'm
- [19:28] even showing you this tool. Sure, all of
- [19:30] this other stuff is interesting. How
- [19:32] much of it are you going to use? You
- [19:33] know, that's up to you. But generally,
- [19:35] just saving all of your files, having
- [19:36] all of the context and having all of the
- [19:38] tools you would ever need in a single
- [19:40] place gives you a massive benefit
- [19:42] because now you don't need to switch
- [19:44] between these different tools. And the
- [19:46] more you use one tool, the better it
- [19:48] gets at understanding your life, your
- [19:50] situation, your business, your code. So,
- [19:52] you just naturally end up getting better
- [19:54] responses over time. And that kind of
- [19:56] compounds, which is why I like to stick
- [19:58] with one specific platform. Even if you
- [20:00] just quickly look here, you can see all
- [20:02] of the different tasks that I was
- [20:03] running, right, just in the past few
- [20:04] days using GenSpark because it is
- [20:07] genuinely very, very good. Anyways guys,
- [20:09] that's it for this video. If you
- [20:10] enjoyed, make sure you leave a like,
- [20:11] subscribe, and I will see you in the
- [20:13] next one.
