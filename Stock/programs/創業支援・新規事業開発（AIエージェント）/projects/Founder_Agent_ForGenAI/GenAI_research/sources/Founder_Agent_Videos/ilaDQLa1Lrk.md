- [00:00] People that will
- [00:00] join companies next year
- [00:03] will be managers on day one.
- [00:05] They will just be
- [00:05] managing a workforce
- [00:06] that is an
- [00:07] agentic-based workforce,
- [00:09] one that is
- [00:09] extremely powerful
- [00:10] and sometimes clumsy.
- [00:16] Welcome to WorkLab
- [00:17] the podcast for Microsoft.
- [00:19] I’m Molly Wood.
- [00:20] On this show, we explore
- [00:21] the future of work and the power of AI
- [00:23] to amplify human potential
- [00:25] and transform organizations.
- [00:27] And today's guest is at the forefront
- [00:29] of this new world of business.
- [00:31] Dan Diasio is Global Consulting
- [00:33] AI leader at EY.
- [00:35] We'll be talking about moving from
- [00:36] pilot projects to real world impact,
- [00:38] reskilling for the AI era,
- [00:40] and what leadership looks like
- [00:42] when humans and AI agents team up.
- [00:45] EY is in the inaugural class
- [00:47] of the Digital Data Design
- [00:48] Institute at Harvard
- [00:50] Frontier Firm AI Initiative,
- [00:52] hosted by Harvard Business School
- [00:54] in collaboration with Microsoft.
- [00:56] The initiative will research
- [00:57] human-AI collaboration,
- [00:59] upskill global C-suite leadership,
- [01:01] and deliver new insights and tools
- [01:03] to help reinvent organizations
- [01:05] as Frontier Firms.
- [01:07] Dan, welcome to WorkLab.
- [01:08] I'm excited to join you, Molly.
- [01:10] You've been in this business a long time.
- [01:11] Tell me what you have seen
- [01:13] and how you've ended up
- [01:14] in the moment we're in right now.
- [01:15] EY is a large,
- [01:17] complex organization.
- [01:18] We have 400,000 people.
- [01:20] There is 100 years’
- [01:21] worth of history
- [01:22] and had a heritage in the businesses
- [01:25] we operate in.
- [01:26] It was only a couple of months into
- [01:27] after ChatGPT had
- [01:29] kind of arrived on the scene,
- [01:30] and we realized this was very different
- [01:32] from the AI of the past.
- [01:33] I would say AI of the past
- [01:35] was really focused as a discipline,
- [01:36] like there was a team of data scientists
- [01:38] and machine learning engineers
- [01:40] that were really responsible
- [01:41] for taking data and turning that
- [01:43] into insights and
- [01:44] translating that into actions.
- [01:46] It was a part of our organization.
- [01:48] What we realized pretty quickly
- [01:49] is that AI was going to impact
- [01:51] every single corner
- [01:52] across every part of our business,
- [01:55] and we needed to really rethink
- [01:56] what our organization was going to be.
- [01:58] So we created a part of our business.
- [02:01] We called it EY.ai,
- [02:02] which was the symbol for us internally
- [02:04] that we need to move from the old
- [02:06] business EY.com to EY.ai,
- [02:09] and that meant a real rescale
- [02:11] and rethink of everything
- [02:12] that we do across the organization
- [02:13] and how we enable our people.
- [02:15] I'd say it's been very fundamental,
- [02:17] but we really started with a purpose
- [02:19] and an intent to be able to drive
- [02:21] AI systemically across the business,
- [02:22] as opposed to just turn it on in a way.
- [02:25] It feels like you saw something
- [02:26] really important coming
- [02:27] because to be candid about the
- [02:29] elephant in the room, I would say that
- [02:31] people feel that the advent of LLMs
- [02:34] and the way that people are using AI now
- [02:36] could pose a threat to the consulting
- [02:38] business that we have always known.
- [02:40] I'm putting this gently,
- [02:41] but it sounds like EY
- [02:43] saw that almost immediately
- [02:45] and moved to adapt.
- [02:46] Yeah, I mean, I think there's been a lot
- [02:48] written about the
- [02:49] demise of the knowledge worker
- [02:51] in the space of AI.
- [02:52] That as cost of knowledge
- [02:53] goes to zero, what happens
- [02:55] to all of these knowledge workers?
- [02:57] And, you know, over time,
- [02:58] I didn't have this impression immediately.
- [03:00] Like there was a bit of shock
- [03:01] and awe that happened in the beginning.
- [03:03] But over time,
- [03:04] I've come to appreciate and believe
- [03:06] that the knowledge worker
- [03:07] is just totally underrated in this moment.
- [03:10] Let's talk about your career at EY
- [03:11] because you’ve been there
- [03:12] a long time,
- [03:12] you’ve been in this business
- [03:13] a long time.
- [03:15] So, Molly, this is a
- [03:16] really fascinating time.
- [03:17] I would say, right now
- [03:18] I spend most of my time
- [03:19] working on trying to help
- [03:21] EY become a Frontier Firm.
- [03:24] And that really means that I focus on
- [03:25] four things every day.
- [03:26] You know, so first
- [03:28] I'm really working with our teams
- [03:29] that are supporting our clients
- [03:30] and trying to move from this idea
- [03:32] of ideation and experimentation
- [03:34] into enterprise scale with our AI agendas.
- [03:37] The second is, if you make a list
- [03:39] of all the industries that are going
- [03:41] to be impacted by AI
- [03:43] professional services near the top of that list.
- [03:45] So we are actively working to
- [03:46] look at everything we do
- [03:48] to deliver value for our clients
- [03:49] and start to infuse AI to become
- [03:51] much more AI powered.
- [03:52] The third is
- [03:53] we have a historical dedication
- [03:56] to a business model
- [03:57] that is focused on effort, and
- [03:58] we are looking to break that with AI.
- [04:00] So there's a lot around
- [04:01] commercial model innovation.
- [04:02] And then fourth, the very essence of
- [04:04] EY is all about our people.
- [04:06] So we are working on building
- [04:07] training programs, tooling and enablement
- [04:09] to really empower the workforce.
- [04:10] I spend most of my time these days
- [04:12] really trying to figure out how we kind of
- [04:15] create a new professional services firm
- [04:16] that is based much more on AI
- [04:18] and disrupting the old one.
- [04:19] There are so many things to unpack there.
- [04:22] Let's start with just the EY part of it,
- [04:24] just the internal transformation.
- [04:25] Because, of course, that's incredibly
- [04:27] valuable when it comes to helping clients.
- [04:29] But I would imagine presents
- [04:31] its own set of challenges
- [04:33] given the size and
- [04:35] history of a firm like EY.
- [04:37] So, Molly, if I can tell you a story?
- [04:39] Say more, absolutely.
- [04:40] So shortly after ChatGPT
- [04:42] came onto the scene, we realized
- [04:44] that our clients were being bombarded
- [04:46] by PowerPoints explaining what AI was.
- [04:48] And you can't learn that much about
- [04:51] how these things work from a PowerPoint.
- [04:53] So we created something inside our
- [04:55] organization that we called a master class.
- [04:58] We would show up with laptops
- [04:59] in our clients,
- [05:01] often in their boardroom
- [05:02] or with their management committee.
- [05:04] And we had some
- [05:05] simple tools and a script.
- [05:07] Often that script was to be able to use
- [05:10] AI to build a new snack product
- [05:13] in a lot of ways, so
- [05:15] it was kind of simple,
- [05:16] It was guided, it was scripted,
- [05:17] but it got their hands on the keyboards.
- [05:20] And it was fascinating,
- [05:22] like just to watch this magic happen
- [05:24] where CEOs were working in teams
- [05:26] with their management committee,
- [05:29] building new products,
- [05:30] creating new marketing plans,
- [05:32] creating jingles
- [05:33] that they could use to advertise it,
- [05:34] and then pitching it
- [05:35] back to their committees.
- [05:36] So it was really, really powerful.
- [05:39] But then we took a step back.
- [05:40] We've done this hundreds of times now,
- [05:42] and I've looked at the results
- [05:43] of all the images of the products
- [05:45] that people have built over time,
- [05:47] and it's all the same looking stuff.
- [05:51] So it's all the same sort of packaging.
- [05:53] It's all the same ingredients,
- [05:55] the same recipes,
- [05:56] the same marketing plans.
- [05:57] Like if this stuff were to come true,
- [05:59] we would have a global shortage
- [06:00] of matcha
- [06:01] and monk fruit everywhere.
- [06:03] But it's a lot of the same.
- [06:05] So what that kind of really translates
- [06:07] to us is AI makes it very easy to produce
- [06:10] something good, but it kind of
- [06:12] commoditizes the output.
- [06:14] And in a lot of ways it raises the floor,
- [06:16] but it doesn't raise the ceiling.
- [06:18] So what does it take
- [06:19] to actually raise the ceiling?
- [06:21] And what we say at EY is that it's
- [06:23] AI and something.
- [06:25] You have to bring context to be able
- [06:28] to really unlock its potential.
- [06:30] We often refer to these things
- [06:31] as the big four.
- [06:32] So you need to have creativity.
- [06:34] You need to have critical thinking,
- [06:36] systems thinking, and deep domain
- [06:39] expertise to be able to really get
- [06:41] what's possible into the system, to work
- [06:44] together with the system, to be able
- [06:46] to create the right and best output.
- [06:48] And in a lot of ways, that's essentially
- [06:51] what consultants are very good at.
- [06:54] So we see that the role of the consultant
- [06:56] is going to shift from one that does
- [06:57] a lot of work and produces content
- [07:00] to one that is much more of a creator,
- [07:02] and using agents
- [07:03] to be able to do a lot of that work.
- [07:05] I mean, as you describe it,
- [07:06] it sounds like what you're saying is
- [07:07] we're going to have our consultants
- [07:08] go back to being great, right?
- [07:10] Like not that they weren't great
- [07:12] to start with, but that there is an
- [07:14] up-leveling that is required
- [07:17] to not only stay ahead but be the best.
- [07:19] And I think they have, you know, often
- [07:21] we find that consultants
- [07:22] have contexts that exists
- [07:24] outside the organization
- [07:25] in which they're supporting’s four walls,
- [07:27] and that is extremely valuable
- [07:29] to be able to get the most out of AI.
- [07:31] So, I do think it is a big change
- [07:32] to move from the old consulting model
- [07:34] to the new consulting model,
- [07:36] but I don't think that work goes away.
- [07:37] It changes,
- [07:38] and I think it becomes more important.
- [07:40] Let's talk about your clients now.
- [07:41] How often are you now
- [07:43] telling this story to them?
- [07:45] I think this is, you know,
- [07:47] we are going through a period right now
- [07:49] where there's too much focus
- [07:51] on productivity
- [07:52] and there's not as much focus
- [07:54] as needed on growth.
- [07:56] And this is very much
- [07:57] part of the growth agenda,
- [07:59] how we start to move
- [08:01] from thinking about what we do today
- [08:02] and how we can use technology
- [08:04] to automate it,
- [08:05] to how we can start
- [08:06] to empower people to start
- [08:07] to create the businesses of the future.
- [08:09] So, it is probably a daily
- [08:11] part of that talk tracks
- [08:12] that I have with clients.
- [08:13] Is it like a matcha granola bar?
- [08:15] Like, what are we talking here?
- [08:16] There's like some monk fruit in it,
- [08:18] some matcha,
- [08:19] You know, often some
- [08:20] some like natural chocolate.
- [08:22] I mean, the same packaging.
- [08:24] It's very crusty looking,
- [08:25] you know, deep greens and browns.
- [08:27] Very environmentally friendly.
- [08:28] Of course, yeah.
- [08:30] I mean, I kind of want to try it.
- [08:32] But we're off topic.
- [08:33] As you start to socialize the adoption
- [08:37] of this technology
- [08:38] with this really important realization,
- [08:40] right, that your human skills matter,
- [08:41] that your context matters,
- [08:42] that your internal data
- [08:45] and the context that brings
- [08:46] you as a business matter,
- [08:47] what kind of specifics
- [08:48] are you starting to talk to people
- [08:50] about when it comes to adoption?
- [08:52] Like, are we building a playbook at last?
- [08:54] Yes, I think we have the beginnings
- [08:56] of a playbook that's been really effective
- [08:57] for many of the clients
- [08:58] that we've been supporting.
- [08:59] The last couple of years
- [09:00] have been an investment in technology.
- [09:02] You're building tools,
- [09:03] and when you use those tools
- [09:05] and you expect to get value
- [09:06] out of those tools, what do you do?
- [09:07] You say, does the tool do
- [09:08] what my person did before?
- [09:10] And then you get into
- [09:10] this productivity loop.
- [09:12] And unfortunately productivity has a limit.
- [09:14] Like there's only so much value
- [09:15] you can create with productivity.
- [09:17] Growth has no limit associated with it.
- [09:20] So, we see that in order to be successful,
- [09:23] you know, you referred to a playbook
- [09:24] earlier, Molly,
- [09:25] in order to be successful,
- [09:26] it takes three things.
- [09:28] It takes the mindset,
- [09:29] the skill set, and the tool set.
- [09:32] And right now,
- [09:32] most of the investments
- [09:33] have gone towards the tool set.
- [09:35] There's not as much in the mindset
- [09:38] and the skill set.
- [09:40] So, what we see is
- [09:41] enterprise transformation
- [09:43] actually begins with the intent
- [09:45] of how we start to frame the problem,
- [09:47] how we start to look after the objectives
- [09:49] of what we're trying to get out of AI.
- [09:51] Are we just using it to do
- [09:52] what we do today?
- [09:53] Or are we going to reinvent
- [09:55] the entire new way of working?
- [09:57] And that shift is something
- [09:58] that I think we're starting to see over
- [10:00] the last couple of months
- [10:01] of moving away from use cases towards
- [10:04] more of a reinvention agenda.
- [10:05] And so how is the concept
- [10:08] and the introduction of agentic tools
- [10:10] and agentic AI
- [10:12] starting to change this conversation
- [10:13] even more, because it feels to me like
- [10:15] that’s a bit of a gateway drug
- [10:16] to really thinking
- [10:17] about transformation in a different way.
- [10:19] Not just productivity,
- [10:20] but new types of employees.
- [10:23] Yeah.
- [10:23] So, new types of employees.
- [10:25] It’s such an interesting concept.
- [10:28] Like, I think next year will be the first year
- [10:31] that when you work at a company,
- [10:33] you will be a manager,
- [10:34] and you will not just have
- [10:36] a human workforce
- [10:36] in which you're managing.
- [10:38] And, agents
- [10:39] are going to be really responsible
- [10:40] for driving a lot of the
- [10:42] what we call at EY
- [10:43] the toil that nobody wants to do
- [10:46] and to start to drive
- [10:47] a lot of that execution path.
- [10:49] But agents are still subject to the same
- [10:52] statistical sameness
- [10:53] if you use them
- [10:54] to do your critical thinking.
- [10:56] So the real sequence of work
- [10:58] should be human, agent, and then human.
- [11:01] And so for that reason,
- [11:03] I don't really see it changing
- [11:05] the need to really focus on the mindset
- [11:08] and the skill set,
- [11:09] because what companies are going to be
- [11:11] after is driving differentiation
- [11:13] from their competitors
- [11:15] and being able to create new markets.
- [11:17] And, the AI is going to create
- [11:19] the same predictable output
- [11:20] for you as it would for somebody else
- [11:22] if you're not using that context with it.
- [11:24] So how does that progression
- [11:26] that you've described
- [11:27] help companies become Frontier Firms?
- [11:31] You know, transition away
- [11:33] from the way they used to do things?
- [11:35] Yeah.
- [11:35] When it starts with the strategy of
- [11:37] what is it that we want to do
- [11:39] and how do we intend to create value?
- [11:42] What we often say to
- [11:43] our clients is create
- [11:45] a point of view
- [11:46] that you would be comfortable
- [11:47] taking to your investors
- [11:48] on what your strategy would be.
- [11:50] Like, the value that you're creating with
- [11:52] AI is not in your portfolio of things
- [11:54] that you're doing.
- [11:55] I mean, it's good and it's valuable.
- [11:57] It's kind of like going to the gym
- [11:58] if you're trying to run the
- [12:00] the New York Marathon,
- [12:01] like gym work and practice runs,
- [12:03] they're helpful,
- [12:04] but they're not the marathon.
- [12:05] And instead, start to think about
- [12:08] what the main objective is
- [12:09] and where value is going to be created.
- [12:11] And that often manifests itself
- [12:12] in 2 to 3 pages of like just plain text.
- [12:15] When you have that,
- [12:16] that helps
- [12:17] you set the mindset, skill set,
- [12:19] and the tool set objective
- [12:20] because you shift from an approach
- [12:22] of just implementing AI everywhere,
- [12:24] to start to think
- [12:25] my marketing function,
- [12:27] I'm going to completely reinvent
- [12:28] my marketing function.
- [12:30] I'm going to target
- [12:31] not just people, but I'm going to target
- [12:33] being able to market to people’s agents
- [12:35] that are going to buy
- [12:36] the products on their behalf.
- [12:38] And you start to get into
- [12:39] just a different territory
- [12:41] in a different space than where the
- [12:42] narrative has been placed in time.
- [12:43] It's so interesting
- [12:44] as you're describing this,
- [12:45] because it sounds like
- [12:47] that's how you should always
- [12:48] be thinking about business.
- [12:50] But I understand that
- [12:52] when a tool like this comes along,
- [12:54] people can have one of
- [12:55] two responses, right?
- [12:55] One is just like,
- [12:56] we got to put it on everything.
- [12:57] We got to smear some of this
- [12:59] peanut butter and jelly on across
- [13:01] everything that we're doing.
- [13:02] Or we might tiptoe
- [13:04] in with a couple of pilots
- [13:05] and then kind of
- [13:06] wait for other firms to figure it out
- [13:08] and then come in all the way.
- [13:10] And I really hear you describing a third
- [13:12] and better way.
- [13:13] I think the practical reality is
- [13:16] the first two
- [13:17] is what we've seen over the course
- [13:18] of the last three years.
- [13:20] And that's partly
- [13:21] because this is an extremely
- [13:23] powerful technology
- [13:24] that we are still learning
- [13:25] all the right
- [13:26] controls to be able
- [13:27] to put this at scale
- [13:29] inside of organizations.
- [13:31] We at EY have something we call,
- [13:32] we refer to as the blueprint.
- [13:34] So when you shift away
- [13:35] and you think about a function that runs
- [13:37] AI natively
- [13:38] as if you've built it
- [13:39] for the era in which we're in today,
- [13:41] then that's not just a process
- [13:44] that's AI powered.
- [13:45] You have multiple layers,
- [13:46] you have connectivity into the sources
- [13:48] that you engage with today, because
- [13:50] you know, it becomes a big question.
- [13:52] Do you want to change and rip out
- [13:53] everything that you've invested
- [13:55] in from a technology perspective?
- [13:57] But then you have an AI native platform,
- [13:58] you have an intelligence layer,
- [14:00] you have a control layer.
- [14:01] The control layer is actually responsible
- [14:03] for maintaining how much autonomy
- [14:06] do you give these agents?
- [14:07] And, like, simple things like
- [14:09] where do you put the agents?
- [14:10] Do you put the agents in the HR master,
- [14:12] or do you put them in
- [14:13] some other registration?
- [14:15] And what access do they have
- [14:16] to be able to run your business?
- [14:17] And then you start to layer
- [14:18] in the process,
- [14:20] what the new jobs are of the future,
- [14:22] and where and how you create value.
- [14:23] And when you stack that up together,
- [14:25] that is the playbook
- [14:27] for how you become
- [14:28] a much more Frontier-focused business
- [14:31] in the area that you want to,
- [14:32] that you want to start to compete in.
- [14:34] Over time, doing that in different places
- [14:37] allows you to work
- [14:38] towards becoming the Frontier Firm.
- [14:39] When you talk to your clients
- [14:40] about their competition,
- [14:41] is it firms that are moving faster
- [14:44] to become Frontier Firms,
- [14:45] or is it AI-first companies
- [14:47] that are coming up behind them?
- [14:48] I would say that that all, of course
- [14:51] Molly, that depends on the industries
- [14:53] in which we're focused on.
- [14:54] But most of my clients
- [14:57] are really concerned
- [14:59] about the competitors
- [15:00] and the disruptors that they do not see
- [15:02] and they are not competing with today.
- [15:04] It's the AI natives.
- [15:05] I mean, there are many companies
- [15:07] that are 40 or 50 people companies
- [15:09] that have multibillion dollar valuations,
- [15:12] and they are starting to be
- [15:13] a very disruptive force
- [15:14] for established businesses.
- [15:16] And you don't see them.
- [15:17] And then all of a sudden
- [15:18] they are $1 billion company
- [15:20] and starting to really eat
- [15:21] into your business model.
- [15:23] I would say that's driving a majority
- [15:25] of the strategic
- [15:26] imperative inside these organizations.
- [15:28] Yeah.
- [15:28] That's always been
- [15:30] a hard thing to keep up with.
- [15:31] You're kind of trying to imagine
- [15:32] the anatomy of your disruptor
- [15:34] as if it's this, like, shadow box of a person,
- [15:37] or a company.
- [15:39] And it is really challenging.
- [15:41] But what I have seen,
- [15:43] I would say over the last six months
- [15:44] that is quite different now,
- [15:46] is that in the beginning,
- [15:47] everybody at the executive
- [15:49] team needed to know about AI.
- [15:51] So the education sessions,
- [15:52] I referred to those master classes,
- [15:53] those were supported by the executives,
- [15:55] in many cases by the boards.
- [15:57] Then slowly, it became a technology thing,
- [15:59] where it became
- [16:00] the responsibility of the CIO
- [16:01] or the CTO to be able
- [16:02] to scale out the technology.
- [16:04] As we start
- [16:05] to get more into mindset, skill set,
- [16:07] being really needed investment
- [16:10] buckets to balance out,
- [16:12] you know, the true transformative power.
- [16:14] It seems to be something
- [16:15] that is going back up to the CEO
- [16:18] and the executive leaders in the company
- [16:20] to start to set the vision
- [16:22] and the strategy.
- [16:23] So, that natural progression, you know,
- [16:25] we tend to overestimate things
- [16:26] in the short term
- [16:27] and underestimate them in the long term.
- [16:29] Like perhaps
- [16:29] that is what
- [16:30] we should have predicted over time.
- [16:32] But we do feel there's an inflection
- [16:33] point happening
- [16:34] where companies are starting to revisit
- [16:36] the way they're thinking about AI
- [16:37] in their organizations.
- [16:38] Interesting.
- [16:39] Before we move off of that,
- [16:41] what are some of the benefits
- [16:42] that a legacy firm
- [16:44] can bring to this conversation?
- [16:46] Like, you know,
- [16:46] we should not assume
- [16:48] that every company will be disrupted
- [16:50] by a brand new AI native company.
- [16:53] Are there things that are built-in benefits
- [16:55] for a company
- [16:56] that's been around for a long time?
- [16:57] Maybe their data set,
- [16:58] maybe, you know, their context?
- [17:00] Yeah.
- [17:01] I mean, I think really what it comes down
- [17:03] to is their scale in a lot of ways.
- [17:07] You know, organizations
- [17:08] I've seen, you know, compete
- [17:10] against some of these AI native startups,
- [17:12] the AI native startups
- [17:13] don't like the messiness,
- [17:14] which is a corporate reality.
- [17:16] Many of these companies
- [17:17] have learned in B2B
- [17:19] constructs, have learned to be able
- [17:20] to sell to an enterprise,
- [17:22] to be able to take technology
- [17:24] to a complex organization.
- [17:26] I’d say that the data flywheel
- [17:28] inside of organizations
- [17:30] is critically important,
- [17:31] because that organizational nuance
- [17:34] and context is what drives differentiation
- [17:37] from just using a general-purpose model.
- [17:39] And then I'd say also it's
- [17:40] the customer reach and contracts.
- [17:42] You know, often
- [17:43] these are incredible
- [17:44] endowments inside of organizations
- [17:46] that really are
- [17:48] the points that allow them to be able
- [17:51] to kind of move into a new market.
- [17:52] Like, there are many
- [17:54] multi-conglomerate technology companies
- [17:56] and some of them find that
- [17:58] their most valuable asset in the AI space
- [18:01] are the game consoles that they have,
- [18:03] and the following of consumers
- [18:07] engaging in gaming
- [18:09] on their game consoles,
- [18:10] because that implicitly
- [18:11] has this community
- [18:12] that can become the flywheel
- [18:14] in which you introduce AI innovation.
- [18:16] Let's talk about employees,
- [18:18] because so far
- [18:19] we've talked about leaders,
- [18:20] and this is a leadership challenge,
- [18:23] bringing employees along.
- [18:24] EY has launched an initiative to upskill
- [18:26] tens of thousands of professionals in AI.
- [18:30] Talk about how important this is
- [18:31] and how you get it done in organizations.
- [18:33] Yeah, this is something that is
- [18:36] as we are a people-based business
- [18:37] and we will be a people-based business,
- [18:40] this is something
- [18:41] that is of critical importance
- [18:42] to us in our organization.
- [18:44] I'll speak for our consulting organization.
- [18:48] Last year, we built a full curriculum
- [18:50] for all of our employees at EY
- [18:53] to get introduced,
- [18:55] to get the foundations,
- [18:56] but then to start to teach
- [18:57] AI to them in the context of their jobs.
- [19:00] And I referred to using AI
- [19:03] to move into a creator-based economy
- [19:05] and to be able to do what's
- [19:07] what's not possible in AI itself.
- [19:09] We call that the “power of the and.”
- [19:11] So, we’re working on teaching our people
- [19:14] how to find their “and.”
- [19:16] How to take their deep
- [19:18] domain expertise and turn that
- [19:20] into a strategic differentiator
- [19:22] in the way that they engage with AI
- [19:24] to create unique content.
- [19:25] So we rolled out this out
- [19:26] to all of our people,
- [19:27] and we feel really good about it
- [19:29] because we've seen our employee
- [19:32] engagement scores go up
- [19:33] as a result of that.
- [19:35] We feel that people feel more in
- [19:37] the driver's seat
- [19:38] of how they can start to shape AI,
- [19:40] as opposed to have I happen to them.
- [19:42] So it's been an investment
- [19:43] that we will continue to make
- [19:44] and all of our people
- [19:45] across the organization every year.
- [19:47] This is such a great point
- [19:48] that you're bringing up,
- [19:49] because there can be a lot of built-in
- [19:52] resistance or skepticism or concern.
- [19:55] You know,
- [19:56] we would be lying
- [19:57] if we said that didn't exist
- [19:58] within organizations.
- [19:59] And it really is a leadership challenge
- [20:02] to champion this, to do it in partnership
- [20:05] with your employees.
- [20:06] Yeah, we run this poll
- [20:08] asking employees
- [20:09] how engaged they are, and how much
- [20:11] they're getting what they need from AI.
- [20:14] Recently, about 85% of them
- [20:16] said they were really excited
- [20:17] for agentic AI, but 86% of them
- [20:20] said they had to learn it on their own.
- [20:22] Most of their learning
- [20:22] was happening on their own.
- [20:23] This is not EY specific.
- [20:25] This is broadly across workers.
- [20:28] So, in order to really engage with people,
- [20:30] you need to have a strategy
- [20:32] with clear intent, which is,
- [20:34] I think, more of a growth strategy
- [20:36] than a productivity strategy.
- [20:37] You need to have the right investments
- [20:39] in helping people develop those skills
- [20:42] and give them the opportunity
- [20:43] and the tooling to be able to
- [20:45] to build that muscle.
- [20:47] And then I think, you have to address
- [20:48] the fact that this is going to be
- [20:50] an ever-going cycle of change.
- [20:53] And, like, change agility
- [20:55] and investing in building out
- [20:57] that muscle is critically important
- [20:59] and something that, you know, I'd say
- [21:01] we're still tackling inside of EY.
- [21:03] How do you communicate that
- [21:04] to leaders at other companies?
- [21:05] That “You may bring them along” to
- [21:07] “You need to start with your strategy
- [21:08] and your desired outcomes
- [21:09] and really go deep on the functions
- [21:12] that you want to change,
- [21:13] but don't leave your employees behind.”
- [21:15] Yeah, I mean, this is the story
- [21:17] of 2025 right now with AI.
- [21:20] It's how do we create more as opposed to,
- [21:23] you know, try to use AI to do the same,
- [21:25] but with less?
- [21:26] What we often do inside of EY
- [21:28] is we believe that, you know,
- [21:30] we can talk all we want
- [21:31] about what a company should do,
- [21:33] but we need to be able to walk
- [21:35] the talk as well.
- [21:36] And we've invested in something
- [21:37] we call our Client Zero Program,
- [21:39] which is where we are doing this
- [21:42] to ourselves first
- [21:43] and then showing our clients
- [21:45] what's worked and what hasn't worked.
- [21:47] And that has been
- [21:48] a really effective tool
- [21:49] of being able to really drive that.
- [21:51] I think the second is
- [21:52] when you can come in with a blueprint,
- [21:54] these, these blueprints
- [21:56] I was referring to say,
- [21:57] this is how you can create value
- [21:59] in an AI native way,
- [22:00] then you automatically shift
- [22:02] to the growth agenda
- [22:03] as opposed to just focusing
- [22:04] on the productivity agenda.
- [22:06] What can you tell us about what has
- [22:07] worked and what hasn't worked?
- [22:08] Okay, so, inside of EY?
- [22:11] Yeah.
- [22:12] So, I'd say at EY
- [22:13] We won't tell anybody.
- [22:14] Don't tell anyone.
- [22:15] No.
- [22:16] Please. This is off the record.
- [22:17] Just between us.
- [22:17] Yes. Okay.
- [22:18] So, in that case,
- [22:20] I think we've done a really good job
- [22:22] with our leadership buy-in
- [22:23] and engagement.
- [22:24] You know, our leaders,
- [22:26] our CEO is very active
- [22:28] in driving and shaping our AI agenda.
- [22:30] Her direct report is responsible
- [22:33] for leading all of the programs
- [22:35] that we're doing
- [22:36] all across our service lines.
- [22:38] And we've cascaded
- [22:39] that down into priorities
- [22:41] for every geography around the world.
- [22:43] So I think leadership buy-in
- [22:45] the investments that we're making
- [22:47] in people, in process, in technology.
- [22:50] Like last year, we've invested over
- [22:51] a billion dollars of capital
- [22:53] into getting ourselves ready
- [22:54] to become that Frontier Firm.
- [22:58] The challenging part that you asked for,
- [23:00] I'd say, you know, and this is
- [23:02] this is not unique to EY,
- [23:04] but this is a massive
- [23:06] and fundamental change of the business.
- [23:09] For us, we are a business model
- [23:12] that has been built on the billable hour,
- [23:14] where people monetize their efforts.
- [23:17] The harder the problem,
- [23:18] the harder you have to work,
- [23:19] the more you get paid
- [23:20] for that particular problem.
- [23:22] And we are going to, through AI,
- [23:25] start to break that business model,
- [23:27] but it fundamentally changes
- [23:29] how we price our services
- [23:30] and how we value our services.
- [23:32] And it's not just us
- [23:33] that needs to change,
- [23:34] it's also the clients that are going to buy
- [23:36] our services in the future
- [23:38] need to be along with
- [23:39] with us for that journey.
- [23:40] So that kind of change management,
- [23:43] change agility and breaking down
- [23:45] the muscle memory of, you know,
- [23:48] being in a business for decades
- [23:51] under a consistent business model
- [23:53] is something that I would say
- [23:54] is the biggest challenge
- [23:56] that we are facing,
- [23:57] but it's something that is critical
- [23:58] for our long-term thriving with AI.
- [24:01] For leaders who want to start
- [24:04] or maybe accelerate their organization’s
- [24:06] AI transformation,
- [24:07] what are some concrete places
- [24:09] that they can begin?
- [24:10] Like, where do you start?
- [24:12] Yeah, look at where
- [24:13] the company creates value
- [24:15] inside the organization today.
- [24:16] I would say it's a value-based story.
- [24:19] It needs to be about growth.
- [24:20] Start in those areas.
- [24:21] So for many
- [24:22] consumer product-based companies
- [24:24] that'll be, what products do you build
- [24:26] and make inside your organization?
- [24:27] And that'll put you down a path
- [24:29] of looking at AI to do product
- [24:30] innovation and R&D,
- [24:32] and to be able to help the sales
- [24:34] and marketing function
- [24:35] or the supply chain function.
- [24:36] If you're in a banking function,
- [24:38] it becomes
- [24:39] a little bit of a different story.
- [24:40] Oil and gas is a different story.
- [24:43] So I'd say it's
- [24:44] a very sector specific story of
- [24:45] think about where you create value.
- [24:47] I know you're going to say that
- [24:48] I'm giving you like an easy answer
- [24:50] and I'm not getting specific enough.
- [24:52] Well, I have an idea
- [24:52] about how we can drill down.
- [24:53] I wonder, is there a temptation
- [24:55] for companies to start
- [24:56] with an underperforming
- [24:58] part of the business,
- [24:58] because that might feel a little bit safer?
- [25:00] Like, are you sort of saying, listen,
- [25:02] go up the gut,
- [25:03] take the thing that you already do
- [25:05] the best and try to figure out
- [25:06] how you can make it better?
- [25:07] Yeah, that that is a great way to say it.
- [25:10] In a lot of ways,
- [25:11] what we see is organizations
- [25:13] wanting to test it out
- [25:15] by experimenting in their back office.
- [25:17] And then when you do that,
- [25:18] you get into this
- [25:19] like cost out productivity.
- [25:20] AI is going to show returns on its P&L
- [25:23] by driving down costs.
- [25:26] I think, you know,
- [25:27] the strategic companies that we see,
- [25:29] they are taking on
- [25:30] challenging business questions
- [25:31] that are existential to their
- [25:33] business strategy,
- [25:34] And they're using that to start
- [25:36] to power their business.
- [25:37] And I think getting to a 2 or 3 page
- [25:40] reinvention of a function
- [25:42] agenda is an easy and tangible way—
- [25:45] well, I shouldn't say easy.
- [25:46] I was going to say.
- [25:47] Sounds like an easy thing to do,
- [25:48] but it is an objective
- [25:51] target that you can set
- [25:52] that allows you to start to push
- [25:54] and move that mindset shift
- [25:56] in the organization,
- [25:58] that this is not about just doing AI, but
- [26:01] it's about changing how we work with AI.
- [26:04] And then if you are an employee,
- [26:06] for employees who want to thrive in
- [26:08] an AI-first workplace,
- [26:10] even if they have been
- [26:11] mandated to upskill.
- [26:13] What are some of the things
- [26:16] that they should focus on right now?
- [26:17] This is probably
- [26:19] the biggest revolution of management
- [26:23] that has ever happened in our society.
- [26:27] And these are really big, bold words.
- [26:29] But, the corporate ladder used to be
- [26:32] that you took a job
- [26:34] and you worked hard by building
- [26:36] credibility and experience.
- [26:37] And ultimately
- [26:38] if you did that really well,
- [26:40] you became a manager.
- [26:41] And then you managed and oversaw people.
- [26:44] And today, the corporate ladder
- [26:45] is being completely kicked over.
- [26:48] People that will join companies
- [26:50] next year will be managers on day one.
- [26:53] They will just be managing a workforce
- [26:55] that is an agentic-based workforce,
- [26:57] one that is extremely powerful
- [26:59] and sometimes clumsy.
- [27:00] And they'll have to have
- [27:01] the requisite skills
- [27:02] to be able to do that
- [27:04] technological management.
- [27:06] So that's where I get into those four
- [27:08] that I described earlier.
- [27:10] I think that really requires
- [27:12] that critical thinking,
- [27:13] that creativity,
- [27:14] that systems thinking
- [27:16] and the domain expertise
- [27:18] to make that happen.
- [27:19] And I'll just add a fifth one in here
- [27:20] because it feels right.
- [27:22] But there's got to be a real structured
- [27:26] and a real investment
- [27:28] in developing the delegation skills.
- [27:30] Because giving agents instructions
- [27:33] to be able to go do the work,
- [27:35] and then critically evaluating
- [27:36] if that happened in the appropriate
- [27:38] way is critical
- [27:39] for how a worker can thrive
- [27:41] by being able to accomplish much more
- [27:42] than what they'd be without
- [27:43] what was possible yesterday.
- [27:45] This is just partly me
- [27:47] and how I like to work,
- [27:48] but this sounds like a workplace
- [27:49] I would want to be a part of.
- [27:51] As opposed to, like, I'm
- [27:52] you know, I'm an entry level worker
- [27:53] who's going to come in
- [27:53] and do a bunch of rote skills
- [27:55] and regurgitate things.
- [27:57] To be able to come in and say,
- [27:58] have creative thinking, right?
- [28:00] Have critical thinking skills,
- [28:03] set strategy for an agent.
- [28:06] It seems like a good story.
- [28:07] I think there's a lot of upside.
- [28:09] I mean, really, at the end of the day,
- [28:11] I think this technology
- [28:12] will start to power a new economy
- [28:15] just like the internet did.
- [28:17] You know, at first
- [28:18] when the internet first came along,
- [28:19] we were really worried
- [28:21] that it was going to replace
- [28:22] all the mail carriers.
- [28:23] And then it created
- [28:24] trillion-dollar businesses.
- [28:26] It's hard to know
- [28:27] exactly what those businesses
- [28:29] are going to be,
- [28:30] but I know those businesses
- [28:31] will be created by people
- [28:33] that have learned
- [28:34] how to scale their impact
- [28:36] and their creative thinking by using AI.
- [28:39] In any technological revolution,
- [28:41] there's always in the beginning,
- [28:43] first fear and then reinvention.
- [28:45] And I think we're just coming out of
- [28:47] that fear phase right now.
