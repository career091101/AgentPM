## Text

- [00:00] Last week, uh, I did a video on how I
- [00:02] was planning to do like a trading AI
- [00:04] agent that was using Claude code as the
- [00:07] agent and just trying to come up with
- [00:09] different trades we can do on like
- [00:11] stocks with CFDs. So, uh, in this video,
- [00:15] I just want to show you the results of
- [00:17] my full week of uh, doing a few trades
- [00:21] uh, using my AI agents. And I wouldn't
- [00:25] say this strategy is nothing like genius
- [00:29] or special or anything like that. It's
- [00:31] just an experiment I wanted to do and
- [00:34] I'm going to try over the next few weeks
- [00:35] to iterate [music]
- [00:37] and I kind of want to share my results.
- [00:39] So if you're interested, uh this video
- [00:41] is just going to be how we did the first
- [00:44] week. Uh but there there's a lot of
- [00:46] flaws here, some things I need to learn.
- [00:48] But uh yeah, just wanted to share the
- [00:50] results and maybe you can take something
- [00:53] away from this. So now the video is just
- [00:55] going to take off where the last one
- [00:57] ended with my first trade and just go
- [00:59] through the week. So yeah, enjoy. Okay,
- [01:01] so after some back and forward, we kind
- [01:03] of ended up on two trades. Uh we are
- [01:07] going to do or that I did. Uh we ended
- [01:09] up with uh Beyond Meat and we're going
- [01:12] to do a 5x leverage and on the Sophie uh
- [01:15] we're going to do the 2.5 leverage. I'm
- [01:18] going to screen record my phone. I'm
- [01:20] going to show you the trades we have
- [01:22] done so far. Okay. So, you can see this
- [01:24] is the sofa trade we did. You can see we
- [01:26] did a 29.98
- [01:28] opening price here. And if you look at
- [01:31] the stop loss, we're going to do 27.5.
- [01:33] And the takerit is just going to be as
- [01:35] high as it gets, I guess. For the beyond
- [01:38] meat, this is at 2 uh if you go to
- [01:41] Beyond Meat, 2.08. Now, we're going to
- [01:44] do uh an entry price, I think, at 1.9.
- [01:47] if we go down there. Uh so that is
- [01:49] basically the strategy. Okay. So there's
- [01:51] like 5 minutes now until the market
- [01:54] open. We have our trades for today. Uh
- [01:57] but first let's check out how we did
- [01:59] yesterday.
- [02:00] So uh I made a simple tracker here so we
- [02:03] can zoom in a bit. We made $2 on our
- [02:06] trade. So we had like this so far long
- [02:09] here. Uh the entry was 29.98. We exited
- [02:14] at 30.06.
- [02:16] So, a very low volatility trade even
- [02:19] though we have 2.5 leverage. Yeah, we
- [02:21] made $2. Uh, to be honest, I forgot to
- [02:25] close out the beyond me trade. So, I'm
- [02:28] going to do that now when the market
- [02:29] opens and I'm going to add that into the
- [02:33] day two overview. Uh, but so far I guess
- [02:36] we are in profits. So, let's take a look
- [02:39] at today
- [02:40] uh the today's trades. So, uh, the first
- [02:43] one is going to be to go long ups
- [02:47] and I have, uh, done the trades. I'm
- [02:50] going to pull up on the screen here
- [02:52] afterwards, like a screenshot. And you
- [02:55] can see, uh, yeah, we're going to go in
- [02:57] with 5S leverage. We're going to do
- [02:59] $1,200 exposure. Uh, and again, it wants
- [03:02] to short beyond the meat. So, I guess
- [03:05] we're just going to try that again.
- [03:07] Yesterday, we went long. We'll see soon.
- [03:10] uh I guess next episode how that went.
- [03:12] But uh this time we're going to try to
- [03:14] go short. So yeah, I guess that's the
- [03:16] update for day two. So I'm going to keep
- [03:19] updating day three, four, and five, and
- [03:21] then we're going to do like a final
- [03:22] thing. Okay, so uh yeah, we are on day
- [03:26] three. So I was just looking at Nvidia
- [03:28] here. This is uh looking very good
- [03:30] pre-market. Uh but I want to take up one
- [03:33] thing because um yeah, uh I made some
- [03:36] changes. So today we're going to try to
- [03:38] do a long short hedge pair workflow. So
- [03:42] we're going to find one stock to go
- [03:43] short and one to go long over the
- [03:46] intraday. So we can do this kind of
- [03:48] inside the same sector. Let's see. So I
- [03:51] have started this workflow here now to
- [03:53] look for uh pairs we can do a long short
- [03:56] trade on. Uh but we have to look how it
- [03:59] went yesterday and not good news because
- [04:03] yeah we lost $45. So that means uh our
- [04:09] yeah overall now is at minus 43.
- [04:12] [snorts] Uh one thing that happened is I
- [04:15] was going to place the beyond meat trade
- [04:17] but I don't know what happened. It
- [04:19] wasn't registered. So we only up ended
- [04:21] up with the USPS trade that lost us $45.
- [04:25] This actually went to stop-loss. So we
- [04:29] kind of automatically was uh sold out of
- [04:31] this trade. Uh but I had a quick look.
- [04:33] If we had stayed in, we wouldn't have
- [04:36] survived anyway. Uh, but now I'm going
- [04:39] to I'm going to just let this run and
- [04:41] we're going to find the pair we're going
- [04:42] to hedge today and I'm going to place
- [04:44] the bets. So, let's just wait and see
- [04:46] what that's going to be. Okay, so these
- [04:48] are the trades we're going to do. We're
- [04:49] going to do long SoFi and short PayPal.
- [04:52] Uh, we have already entered. So, I'm
- [04:54] going to bring that up on the screen
- [04:56] here. You can see we started pretty good
- [04:58] from the start here on PayPal and we're
- [05:00] a bit down on SoFi, but uh doesn't
- [05:03] really matter. I'm going to let it run
- [05:05] and have the stop losses target kind of
- [05:07] where we if we uh strike out that's
- [05:10] fine. It doesn't really matter too much.
- [05:12] So that is going to be the trade. So
- [05:14] yeah, I guess you will see how this went
- [05:17] in just a second. I have to wait 8
- [05:19] hours. Okay, so the market has closed
- [05:22] and as you can see, I think we did
- [05:24] pretty good here to be honest. Uh we
- [05:26] ended up with uh we going so far long,
- [05:30] right? We lost $15 on that trade, but
- [05:33] since we have kind of did that hedged
- [05:35] thing, uh we also had uh PayPal uh
- [05:39] short. So what we ended up with with the
- [05:42] PayPal short uh trade uh was $31 plus,
- [05:46] right? So we ended up with like $15 in
- [05:49] profit. And yeah, I think this shows
- [05:52] that this strategy can work. And I think
- [05:55] we got to continue with this the rest of
- [05:57] the week. And if we move this over here
- [05:59] to our yeah total now, you can see we
- [06:02] are still in the red. And that was
- [06:04] mostly because of the long UPS trade we
- [06:06] did that went minus 45. Uh but we are up
- [06:10] to two winning trades, two losing
- [06:12] trades. And we did uh reduce the loss a
- [06:15] bit. And yeah, hopefully at the end of
- [06:17] the week we can be in the green. So
- [06:19] let's just wait and see. Uh but now I
- [06:21] want to show you the trade we're going
- [06:23] to do today. uh because I have
- [06:25] calculated that and again it's going to
- [06:27] be like a long short trade or like a
- [06:30] short long trade. Uh we're going to do
- [06:32] short CQQ. This is like the Chinese
- [06:36] uh what do you call it like tech um yeah
- [06:40] some kind of ETF and we're going to do
- [06:43] long gold. Right. So, I'm just going to
- [06:46] bring up the uh the trades here on the
- [06:49] screen. And as you can see, uh this is
- [06:52] what I'm going to place. So, hopefully
- [06:54] this uh is going to be good. And let's
- [06:58] just let this run for a while. Let's see
- [07:00] how it goes. And I'm going to take you
- [07:02] back uh when this is completed. So, for
- [07:06] you again, that's going to be a second.
- [07:08] For me, it's going to be some hours.
- [07:11] So uh we are now on the last uh trading
- [07:14] day. Uh so this is Friday 31st of
- [07:17] October I guess. So yeah, as you can see
- [07:20] on the screen, these are yesterday's
- [07:22] trade. And yeah, we did pretty good. You
- [07:24] can't really see it here, but uh the
- [07:26] gold long uh was pretty good. At least
- [07:29] $12 up. And you can see the differences
- [07:32] between the other two trades. Uh it was
- [07:34] about $20. So yeah, that was a green and
- [07:38] green trade. So, we went gold long and
- [07:40] we shorted the tech Chinese ETF.
- [07:45] So, if you go out to a tracker now, you
- [07:47] can see if we add all this up, we are
- [07:49] 676
- [07:51] yay dollars in profit for the week with
- [07:54] four winning trades and two losing
- [07:56] trades. So, yeah, we added those here.
- [07:59] QCQ short and gold long. Perfect. So,
- [08:02] that is pretty interesting. And today is
- [08:05] the final day. If we can just keep in
- [08:07] the green today, that means that we have
- [08:09] a profitable week, uh, we're not going
- [08:12] to we can't really quit our daytime job
- [08:14] here and live off this. But, uh, it's
- [08:18] pretty fun anyway. And I think I'm going
- [08:20] to continue doing this because I had a
- [08:22] lot of fun with it. So, let's bring up
- [08:25] today's trades. Uh, I just had a look
- [08:28] and we're going to do these trades
- [08:31] today. So, we're going to continue with
- [08:33] this kind of same sector hedge bet where
- [08:36] we do a long short trade or a short
- [08:38] long, call it what you want. So, today's
- [08:41] selection was uh VDC and STX. I have
- [08:46] learned something this week. I'm going
- [08:47] to share that uh on tomorrow's
- [08:49] breakdown, and I think I have a new
- [08:52] strategy for next week that's going to
- [08:54] maybe be a bit better. I'm at least
- [08:57] eager to try it out. But now, uh for
- [08:59] you, it's just going to be a few
- [09:01] seconds. we can see how this trade went
- [09:04] and we got to kind of conclude the first
- [09:05] week. Uh it's been a real blast so far.
- [09:08] So I'm going to do a conclusion and see
- [09:10] how we did and talk a bit about what's
- [09:12] going to happen next. But yeah, see you
- [09:14] in a sec. And that was the end of the
- [09:16] week. So as you can see on the last day,
- [09:18] we were pretty I'm just going to call it
- [09:21] lucky because I don't really know what
- [09:22] I'm doing here. But we did well. Uh we
- [09:24] ended up in uh what I would say is a
- [09:27] nice profit here from this trade. So,
- [09:30] uh, if you go check out the CFD trade
- [09:32] tracker now, yeah, we are almost $47 up,
- [09:36] right? Uh, there are some small decimal
- [09:40] errors here like, but the main thing is
- [09:42] we ended up with five winning trades and
- [09:44] three losing trades. So, uh, and a few
- [09:48] missed trades. I'm not so uh have so
- [09:51] much experience on this platform, but
- [09:53] it's getting better. So I would say
- [09:56] after this first week uh I really enjoy
- [09:58] this. I had a lot of fun with it.
- [10:00] Basically that was the point and I think
- [10:02] there are ways to iterate. So I made
- [10:05] some plans for next week. I'm going to
- [10:07] try to iterate. So let me just show you
- [10:09] kind of my initial plan I want to try
- [10:11] out. So this just comes from my first
- [10:14] week of observations. And of course this
- [10:16] has nothing to do with strategy, the way
- [10:19] you should do things. This is just my
- [10:21] experience. And that is kind of exactly
- [10:23] what you see here. We're just going to
- [10:24] find us trading pair. We go short long.
- [10:27] We're going to find the direction. If
- [10:29] it's short, we're going to cut the long.
- [10:31] If it's long, we're going to cut a
- [10:32] short. Just going to try it out. Just
- [10:35] see how it goes for like five trading
- [10:37] days. So, that is just going to be my
- [10:39] strategy. Super simple, nothing fancy,
- [10:42] and it's just going to be interesting to
- [10:43] see where this goes. Uh I also have some
- [10:46] small adjustments to the context. So,
- [10:49] one thing I started with was uh let I
- [10:51] can just close this. So one thing I
- [10:54] start is I'll give give this right
- [10:56] before we run the agent. I'm going to
- [10:58] give it like a few front pages of like
- [11:01] say CNBC. We can do Bloomberg I think
- [11:05] Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg. So just on
- [11:08] front pages with some futures and some
- [11:12] headlines just before the market opens.
- [11:14] That is one other thing I added and
- [11:16] that's pretty much it. Nothing fancy or
- [11:19] anything like that. just some yeah
- [11:21] experiments and I've been playing around
- [11:23] with my custom instructions if you saw
- [11:26] the previous video. So now now this is
- [11:28] more of like a yeah we're going to do a
- [11:31] trading pair on like a long short hedge
- [11:33] strategy every week. So nothing about
- [11:37] this is uh there's no beta, there's no
- [11:40] alpha, there's no edge or there's
- [11:43] nothing like this. It's just me having
- [11:45] fun with using uh cloud code and agents
- [11:49] to make trades with. There is no edge
- [11:51] here. I think at least not yet. Can't
- [11:54] see any edge, but I'm having fun with
- [11:56] it. That is uh the most important part.
- [11:58] And it's pretty low risk. I'm not
- [12:00] risking like huge money. But if you want
- [12:03] to follow along, check it out next week.
- [12:04] I'm probably going to do a video from
- [12:06] day one to five again. Uh I'm not going
- [12:08] to do it in like two steps as I did now.
- [12:11] I'm just going to record every day and
- [12:13] we're going to do the conclusion at the
- [12:14] end of the week. That is my plan. So
- [12:17] yeah, if you enjoyed this short uh
- [12:20] experiment, give this video a like and
- [12:22] yeah, hopefully I see you again next
- [12:24] week where we can continue updating our
- [12:26] trade tracker here. So yeah, enjoy your
- [12:29] day and we speak
