- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] in this specific video, we are going to
- [00:06] discuss about this amazing ID which is
- [00:07] called as stray AI and uh if I talk
- [00:10] about Trey AI, this is an amazing ID for
- [00:12] collaborative development and
- [00:14] intelligence automation. uh I have been
- [00:17] using a lot of different ids and uh you
- [00:20] know I have really found out this
- [00:21] particular ID recently and it's quite
- [00:24] amazing uh because I'll be talking about
- [00:26] the recent announcement that they have
- [00:27] specifically made and uh how this uh ID
- [00:31] is super amazing in terms of wipe coding
- [00:34] in terms of uh implementing any kind of
- [00:36] projects and uh not only that it has a
- [00:40] lot of features like agents custom
- [00:41] agents it also has features wherein you
- [00:44] can specifically use MCP integrated with
- [00:46] any kind of services. Um along with that
- [00:49] you can also create your own custom
- [00:50] agents and many more things. So all
- [00:52] these things will be discussed in this
- [00:54] specific video. We'll break down it.
- [00:56] We'll be implementing some amazing end
- [00:58] to-end solutions. I'll be doing that
- [01:00] kind of wipe coding in front of you and
- [01:02] I'll be showing you how we can probably
- [01:03] use this specific ID. Uh please make
- [01:06] sure that you watch this video till the
- [01:07] end because it'll be quite amazing uh
- [01:09] just by seeing the features of this
- [01:10] particular uh ID. So here uh you can see
- [01:14] that as soon as you open or you go to
- [01:16] Trey AI wra
- [01:19] uh here it is basically written
- [01:20] collaborate with intelligence uh this TA
- [01:23] ID integrate seamlessly into your
- [01:25] workflow collaborating with you to
- [01:27] maximum performance and efficiency. Now
- [01:29] first of all let me talk about some of
- [01:31] the very important features that it
- [01:32] actually has. Okay. So if you probably
- [01:35] go ahead and see you'll be able to see
- [01:37] that TAI enables natural conversation to
- [01:40] unlock uh possibilities for human AI
- [01:43] collaboration. Here you can just use
- [01:45] agents add the rate agents hash context
- [01:48] and Trey will get your work done. Uh why
- [01:51] this we will be using add the rate agent
- [01:53] basically means if you're creating your
- [01:54] own custom agents you want to
- [01:55] specifically perform any kind of task at
- [01:58] that point of time you can just directly
- [01:59] use this. If you want to provide context
- [02:01] different kind of context let's say the
- [02:03] context of your code repository any
- [02:05] documents any files uh you just need to
- [02:08] probably use hash context again I will
- [02:10] be showing you everything this uh once I
- [02:12] do the coding part okay so one of the
- [02:15] most important feature here you can see
- [02:16] that uh here you'll be able to customize
- [02:18] your own AI agent uh it introduces a
- [02:21] powerful configurable agent system
- [02:23] design for openness here you can just
- [02:25] see some of the examples as soon as you
- [02:26] select a particular agent you'll be able
- [02:28] to perform any kind of task and you'll
- [02:30] be uh like having a kind of conversation
- [02:33] so that that agent specifically does
- [02:34] that particular task. Uh similarly here
- [02:37] you also have more tools and more
- [02:38] capabilities uh again uh due to and as
- [02:42] you all know how MCP is becoming popular
- [02:44] here you can probably go ahead and add
- [02:46] any MCP which will be using any kind of
- [02:48] other external tools or services that is
- [02:50] provided by any company and you can
- [02:52] integrate it very much easily in your
- [02:54] entire code repository uh whichever
- [02:57] applications you are specifically
- [02:58] developing. So here uh I will be showing
- [03:00] you how this can also be done as we go
- [03:02] ahead. Okay. Along with this uh um the
- [03:06] most amazing part that I probably saw in
- [03:09] this ID is that you'll be able to
- [03:11] provide context from workspace from
- [03:13] folders files code web even if you want
- [03:16] like uh external data right or external
- [03:19] uh information that is available in the
- [03:20] web that also you can actually provide
- [03:22] while we are doing the coding right
- [03:24] along with that you can also integrate
- [03:25] with documents and many more things. So
- [03:27] the first thing uh what we'll do is that
- [03:29] we'll just go ahead and download this uh
- [03:31] for downloading you just need to go
- [03:32] ahead and click on download trade tray
- [03:35] and u this tray id you know once you
- [03:38] probably download here you can see that
- [03:41] it will be downloading an exe file all
- [03:43] you have to do is that once the download
- [03:44] is completed just double click just
- [03:47] click on next next and automatically
- [03:49] like how you probably go ahead and
- [03:50] install the other ids like VS code or
- [03:52] cursor you can also do the installation
- [03:54] right once you do this uh what I have
- [03:57] actually done is that I have already
- [03:58] created a basic uh project folder or
- [04:02] workspace uh and here you can see on the
- [04:05] left hand side uh this is how it looks
- [04:07] like uh just to be more precise here is
- [04:10] your workspace uh here is what you'll be
- [04:13] specifically writing let's say if there
- [04:14] is av file here you'll be having this
- [04:17] this is your venv virtual environment
- [04:19] that I've already created um any kind of
- [04:22] coding that you're basically doing
- [04:23] you'll be able to see it over here uh
- [04:26] this is the most amazing part uh with
- [04:28] respect to all the functionalities that
- [04:30] I shown you right right through the in
- [04:31] the web browser of Trey AI uh all those
- [04:34] functionalities you'll be able to see
- [04:35] over here you'll be able to add an agent
- [04:37] you'll be able to add context images
- [04:39] anything along with this here you'll be
- [04:41] able to see lot different models so
- [04:43] first of all let me talk about the
- [04:44] agenda like first of all we are just
- [04:46] going to go ahead and do the
- [04:47] installation and set up the project then
- [04:49] we are going to go ahead and build some
- [04:50] amazing lang chain AI chatbot assistant
- [04:53] then we'll be working with inbuilt and
- [04:55] custom agents Then we'll be seeing how
- [04:57] we can enable MCP for deep integration
- [04:59] with some external services or tools.
- [05:02] Then uh we'll also understand that how
- [05:04] we can provide code repositories and
- [05:05] external data uh as an context you know
- [05:08] when we are specifically working with
- [05:10] the agent. So all those things will be
- [05:12] probably discussed over here. Uh here
- [05:15] you can see that you can add your agent,
- [05:16] you can also add your custom agent.
- [05:18] Everything I'll be showing you step by
- [05:19] step as we go ahead. Okay. Now the first
- [05:21] thing over here is that uh as soon as
- [05:23] you create a virtual environment uh what
- [05:25] I will do is that I will just go ahead
- [05:27] and ask any questions over here right
- [05:30] I'll just say that hey uh build me a
- [05:34] streamllet streamllet lang
- [05:37] chain chatbot assistant let's
- [05:40] say chatbot assistant a simple
- [05:44] streamlate langchain chatbot assistant
- [05:48] with with grock
- [05:51] Quen model. Okay, I'll just use quen
- [05:54] model. Quen model. Uh, and I'll just say
- [05:57] that hey, just go ahead and probably
- [05:58] create this. Let's see. Uh, it's just
- [06:00] like I'm trying to probably do a wipe
- [06:02] coding over here. So, I've just asked
- [06:03] this specific question. And again, here
- [06:06] you have multiple options like you can
- [06:07] select any of this built-in models. You
- [06:09] can go ahead with cloudy 3.7 on it. You
- [06:11] can go with 3.5. You want to probably go
- [06:14] ahead and use Germany 2.5, you can
- [06:16] basically do it. uh let's say that I'll
- [06:18] just go ahead with the cloud a 3.7s on
- [06:20] it and I'll just go ahead and press
- [06:21] enter. Now what will happen is that uh
- [06:23] as soon as I press enter uh this really
- [06:25] gives you a kind of like a wipe coding
- [06:27] because it knows the entire context uh
- [06:29] whatever I have actually created over
- [06:31] here and all right so here you can see I
- [06:33] need to check if there is an env file
- [06:35] see all this entire code repository it
- [06:37] is able to take it as a context and
- [06:39] it'll be able to probably see and
- [06:41] probably find out our patterns code
- [06:43] understand what we have actually done
- [06:45] the development till now but still you
- [06:47] can see requirement txt file is not
- [06:49] created it'll tell you that hey you need
- [06:51] to probably go ahead and create it and
- [06:52] all many more things. So here you can
- [06:54] see all the steps has been done. Um here
- [06:57] they have created a virtual environment
- [06:59] which I have already done it. So I don't
- [07:00] have to probably do it. Uh install
- [07:02] required packages like let's say
- [07:03] streamlate there's this langin grock and
- [07:06] python.env then you have env file where
- [07:09] you have your grock uh then you create
- [07:12] the app. py file with all the code that
- [07:14] is basically written over here. So all
- [07:16] these things are basically done. So
- [07:18] let's just go ahead and do the step by
- [07:19] step. So first of all, I need to
- [07:21] probably go ahead and just create this
- [07:22] app. py. So I'll just go ahead and click
- [07:24] on apply. Right. So once we do it, I'll
- [07:26] go ahead and accept it. So this is my
- [07:28] code that is entirely written. You can
- [07:30] see that I have probably created a quen
- [07:32] chatbot. You can also go ahead and
- [07:34] verify whether we are just going to use
- [07:35] any quen model or not. Okay. So in order
- [07:38] to just confirm this, what I will do is
- [07:39] that I'll just go to my
- [07:43] console.grock.com. Right. So I'll just
- [07:45] go to this uh sorry this was a spelling
- [07:48] mistake. No worries. I'll just go to
- [07:51] console.grog.com. I will go to my
- [07:53] playground and let's select any model.
- [07:55] So let's say I will just go ahead and
- [07:56] use this quen qw 32 billion parameter.
- [07:59] We need to just verify this. Okay. So
- [08:01] quen 2 32
- [08:05] billion and it should be it should be qw
- [08:11] right I guess. Let's see see let's see
- [08:12] the name. Quen qw 32 billion. Okay. So
- [08:16] it should be QWQ 32 billion. So I'm just
- [08:20] going to specifically use this
- [08:21] particular model. I'm using Chad Gro uh
- [08:23] that is with respect to lang chain and
- [08:25] all the information is over here. Uh the
- [08:28] next thing is that I need to also go
- [08:29] ahead and create my env file with this
- [08:31] name. So I'll just go ahead and apply it
- [08:33] over here. You can also go ahead and
- [08:35] directly apply it. So here you can see
- [08:36] that uh you just need to go ahead and
- [08:40] accept it. Here again you need to just
- [08:42] go ahead and mention your API key,
- [08:44] right? and API key. I hope everybody
- [08:46] knows how to probably go ahead and
- [08:47] create it. So in one of my project, you
- [08:50] know, uh I had probably just copied the
- [08:52] API key. Let me just go ahead and open
- [08:55] it just quickly. So here what I'm
- [08:58] actually going to do is that I'll just
- [09:00] go ahead and uh copy my API key. Okay,
- [09:04] again I don't want to show you the API
- [09:06] key itself. So quickly I will just go
- [09:08] ahead and copy it and I'll save it.
- [09:10] Okay. So this is my API key which is
- [09:12] done and uh my API key is also ready.
- [09:15] Okay. Then uh you can see that uh here
- [09:18] uh it is saying menu install the
- [09:19] required packages. What I will do? I'll
- [09:21] just go ahead and copy this and you can
- [09:23] also give the instruction. You can say
- [09:24] hey go ahead and probably create a
- [09:25] requirement.txt file but I will do it
- [09:28] manually because I like to write some
- [09:30] amount of code instead of completely
- [09:32] depending on the wipe coding part you
- [09:35] know. So here uh you can see that I
- [09:37] required streaml then you have langen
- [09:39] langen gro python.env VNV and I'm just
- [09:42] going to go ahead and save the file.
- [09:43] Right? So almost everything is done. All
- [09:46] you have to do is that just go ahead and
- [09:47] write this particular code. And before
- [09:49] that let's activate the VNV. So I will
- [09:51] say hey activate Venv. Okay. And then I
- [09:56] am just going to go ahead and do the
- [09:58] installation. So pip install minus r
- [10:02] requirement.txt because it will already
- [10:04] it'll tell you see over here it'll tell
- [10:06] you to probably go ahead and do the
- [10:08] installation each and everything. So if
- [10:10] you are a coder right I don't had to
- [10:11] write much lines of code because I've
- [10:14] already done this kind of task. So it
- [10:15] becomes very much easy for me to
- [10:18] probably just go ahead and explore
- [10:19] things try to see that what things are
- [10:21] basically going and the best part over
- [10:22] here is that over here the code is with
- [10:24] respect to the recent things right so if
- [10:26] I'm using cloudy 3.7
- [10:28] uh it is a very good platform with
- [10:30] respect to coding and all right so here
- [10:32] you'll be able to see that I'm able to
- [10:33] have this conversation buffer memory
- [10:35] which is available as a feature in
- [10:37] langin and all right I'm using the gro
- [10:39] API key and I'm probably using this kind
- [10:42] of stuff right now uh after this you
- [10:45] know once Once the installation
- [10:46] basically happens, I can probably go
- [10:47] ahead and do the installation. We have
- [10:50] spoken till now all this about this
- [10:51] particular built-in models. Here you
- [10:53] also have let's say that you want to go
- [10:54] ahead and add your own custom or any
- [10:57] other model. So you can just go ahead
- [10:58] and click on add model. You can choose a
- [11:00] provider. Let's say I want to probably
- [11:02] go ahead with Alibaba cloud. I want to
- [11:04] go ahead and select the model. Just
- [11:05] provide the API key and you'll be able
- [11:07] to add the model. Let's say any of the
- [11:08] model that is not available. Uh right,
- [11:11] you can also go ahead and add it from
- [11:13] here. Right? Let's say I want to go
- [11:14] ahead and use anthropic. I want to use
- [11:16] any other model like let's say cloud for
- [11:18] it. I just need to provide my API key
- [11:19] over here and add the model. Right?
- [11:21] Inbuilt model is also available. And
- [11:23] here you'll also be able to see that
- [11:24] these are my built-in models and this
- [11:26] are your custom models which you can
- [11:28] basically go ahead and add it. Now this
- [11:30] is a very good thing. Now you can see
- [11:31] that entire installation is basically
- [11:33] done. Now all I have to do is that just
- [11:35] go ahead and run it and let's see
- [11:37] whether something will get executed or
- [11:38] not. So I'm just going to go ahead and
- [11:40] write u streamlun app. py and let's see
- [11:44] whether it will get opened or not.
- [11:46] Right? So here I did not even work so
- [11:49] hard related to this. Now here you can
- [11:51] see yeah my entire chatbot is over here.
- [11:54] Now you can probably do any kind of
- [11:55] conversation and you can probably
- [11:57] execute your code right. Uh once this is
- [12:00] done you know so let's say that now let
- [12:02] me just go ahead and show you like we
- [12:03] have already discussed about the
- [12:05] context. Now let's go ahead and create
- [12:06] our own custom agent right. So here you
- [12:09] have this agent right and in agent you
- [12:12] can just directly go ahead and use uh
- [12:14] the inbuilt agents like built-in agents
- [12:16] are over here you can also go ahead and
- [12:18] build with MCP now when you're building
- [12:21] with MCP here you have lot of inbuilt
- [12:23] tools and you can also add an MCP tool
- [12:26] right so uh inbuilt tools I've already
- [12:29] shown you that we can use web search we
- [12:32] can probably use terminal web search is
- [12:33] just like an external search engine
- [12:35] right and you can also use the file
- [12:36] system so first of all let me just go
- [12:38] ahead and show you with respect to uh
- [12:40] create building with MCP when we try to
- [12:43] use this MCP tools itself right so here
- [12:45] uh let's say that I want to go ahead and
- [12:47] add more tools so here uh let's say one
- [12:49] of the tool that I really want to add uh
- [12:52] is like duck duck go search right so
- [12:54] duck go search if you don't know guys it
- [12:56] actually helps us to probably do an
- [12:59] internet search uh and get the
- [13:01] information which is the recent
- [13:02] information that is available in the
- [13:04] internet so once you probably let's say
- [13:06] that you want to probably go ahead and
- [13:07] use duck go search Along with that if
- [13:08] you just go ahead and see there are a
- [13:10] lot of different different MCP
- [13:12] integrations that is already available
- [13:14] from Google drive to radius to brave
- [13:16] search to get file system fetch blender
- [13:20] file crawl playrite everything you
- [13:23] basically have. So it really supports a
- [13:26] huge number of different kind of MCP
- [13:28] servers where you can directly integrate
- [13:30] with your coding solutions right when
- [13:32] you are probably doing that and this
- [13:34] gives you the right kind of feeling for
- [13:35] the wipe coding right I don't have to
- [13:37] probably go ahead and see uh about
- [13:39] different different uh MCP servers and
- [13:41] how to probably integrate it let's say
- [13:42] that I want to go ahead and use duck dug
- [13:44] go search you can also use tavly API if
- [13:46] you really want to go ahead now here you
- [13:49] can see that you will be able to see
- [13:50] that hey we just we need to go ahead and
- [13:52] add this particular code once we add
- [13:54] this coder then we will be able to
- [13:56] integrate with the duckgo search. If you
- [13:58] also want to probably see that hey I
- [13:59] want to probably go ahead and see to the
- [14:01] introduction page about the duck go
- [14:03] search MCV server so I can just go ahead
- [14:05] and click over here and here you can see
- [14:07] that amazingly like how we serve in the
- [14:10] web browser right all the information is
- [14:11] also visible over here and if you go
- [14:13] down here uh here you can see that
- [14:15] you'll be also able to get the MCP
- [14:17] server itself right so that is the same
- [14:19] information that is available this is
- [14:21] with respect to uvx if you go down
- [14:23] you'll be also able to see with respect
- [14:24] to uh npx and all so how that is a basic
- [14:28] way of integrating MCP servers right so
- [14:30] what I will do I'll just go ahead and
- [14:32] use this and I'll just go ahead and
- [14:33] confirm it now before confirming it is
- [14:36] always necessary that you just go you
- [14:38] have to go ahead and paste this right so
- [14:39] I'll just go to this introduction page
- [14:41] if I go down I will be able to see
- [14:44] somewhere uh about the npx or uvx so
- [14:46] here you can see I have the information
- [14:48] about uvx I'll just go ahead and paste
- [14:51] it over here right and I'll just go
- [14:53] ahead and confirm it if there is an API
- [14:54] key that is required you can also go
- [14:56] ahead and add the API key you have to
- [14:57] create the API key. Let's say for Tavi
- [14:59] you can create an API key by going to
- [15:01] the Tavi API website. Then I can just go
- [15:03] ahead and click on I understand and your
- [15:05] duck go search has got integrated. Right
- [15:08] now if I go back over here uh when I'm
- [15:11] building with MCP so now here you'll be
- [15:14] able to see that I have this duck go
- [15:15] search. I also have one more tool that I
- [15:18] have already integrated that is called
- [15:19] as perpeter. So if you probably go ahead
- [15:21] and see uh what exactly perpetrator is
- [15:23] all about here you'll be able to see
- [15:24] that this all functionality it'll be
- [15:26] able to do. If you see about duck duck
- [15:28] go search here you'll be able to search
- [15:30] and fetch the content right so what you
- [15:32] can do is that after going ahead over
- [15:34] here so after going over here what we
- [15:36] are basically going to do is that I'll
- [15:37] just go ahead and ask for some questions
- [15:39] and already inside this builder with MCP
- [15:42] if I just go ahead and click you can see
- [15:43] that duck go search is also there right
- [15:45] as a tool in MCP along with that it also
- [15:48] has a built-in web search we will but we
- [15:50] will try to specifically use this duckgo
- [15:53] search MCP tool so I'll say hey uh
- [15:56] provide
- [15:58] me the recent AI news. uh use doug duggo
- [16:05] search for the retrieval or use doug dug
- [16:08] so go search for the web search itself
- [16:10] or I'll just say use doug duggo search
- [16:13] that's it so let's see whether it'll be
- [16:15] able to analyze and it'll be able to
- [16:17] call the right MCP tool uh out there
- [16:20] right so automatically here you can see
- [16:22] now this dug go search is being called
- [16:24] and it is basically showing that hey
- [16:26] query latest artificial news
- [16:28] breakthrough development and it is
- [16:30] asking me for a permission
- [16:31] I'll just go ahead and click on run and
- [16:33] automatically it should be able to give
- [16:36] you this entire response out here right
- [16:39] and again it is asking me uh let's get
- [16:42] more detailed information of science
- [16:44] daily article so it is basically going
- [16:45] and retrieving or scrapping the data or
- [16:48] searching the data from this particular
- [16:49] website and automatically it is planning
- [16:51] the next step and here you can see all
- [16:54] the information is basically getting
- [16:55] displayed so specifically in builder
- [16:58] with MCP right uh here we have
- [17:00] integrated ed with one NCP that is
- [17:02] called as duck go search and here we are
- [17:04] also able to probably go ahead and uh
- [17:07] you know specifically call this MCP
- [17:10] server out here and you'll be able to
- [17:11] probably get the
- [17:13] information so guys now what we are
- [17:15] basically going to do is that we will
- [17:16] use this context okay now see uh this is
- [17:19] an amazing feature out there uh that is
- [17:22] available in treeai let's say that we go
- [17:24] ahead and select this context in this
- [17:26] context we can add code as a context we
- [17:28] can add file as a context we can add
- [17:30] folder as a context we can add workspace
- [17:32] doc and web so this web will be nothing
- [17:34] but chat based on web search right let's
- [17:37] say I go ahead and use code and in this
- [17:39] specific code u there are some functions
- [17:42] uh that has been seen over here and this
- [17:44] functions is basically coming from this
- [17:46] app py let's say that I go ahead and
- [17:49] probably use this function get llama
- [17:51] response okay so uh this get llama
- [17:54] response is a context that I'm
- [17:56] specifically giving over here and I'll
- [17:57] say that hey uh please explain contain
- [18:00] me the entire code uh for this function
- [18:05] and also
- [18:06] provide also provide suggestions. So
- [18:10] once I write this and I press enter you
- [18:12] know so here you'll be able to see that
- [18:14] it will be able to retrieve the context
- [18:16] from this app.py py file and now it will
- [18:19] be even able to provide us the entire
- [18:22] information about these functions the
- [18:24] explanation out here and it'll also
- [18:26] provide some of the good suggestions
- [18:27] that it has you know like error handling
- [18:30] you can see over here as model
- [18:32] selections you know and there are many
- [18:34] more information that you'll be able to
- [18:36] see over here and this information is
- [18:38] just like validating with the help of uh
- [18:41] the features that are available with
- [18:43] respect to context and again here you
- [18:45] are using the default agent to do that
- [18:46] Right? Uh an amazing feature out there.
- [18:49] Similarly, you can go ahead and provide
- [18:51] context with respect to files, folders,
- [18:53] workspace, uh doc anymore as such.
- [18:56] Right? And again, you can go ahead and
- [18:57] try out with different different
- [18:58] built-in models also like cloudy 3.7
- [19:01] senator 3.5 sonnet or cloud for set
- [19:05] itself. Now, the next step is that we'll
- [19:07] just go ahead and go ahead and create
- [19:08] our own custom agent. Right? So, right
- [19:10] now when we clicked on agent, one was
- [19:12] like the built-in tools that you have,
- [19:15] right? One is builder with MCP. Right
- [19:18] now let's say that I want to go ahead
- [19:19] and create my own custom agent. Now this
- [19:20] custom agent I want to probably go ahead
- [19:22] and say hey this should be a web search
- [19:24] or it can be calculator. Here you can
- [19:26] probably go ahead and write a prompt.
- [19:28] I'll say that hey um you are an
- [19:34] assistant who will
- [19:39] perform web search and provide a
- [19:44] summary. Okay, provide a summary. Let's
- [19:46] say that this is what is my prompt,
- [19:49] right? And here you can see that what
- [19:50] all tools it has. So let's say that I
- [19:53] don't want to use this web search. I I
- [19:55] don't want to use any terminal or file
- [19:57] system. I just want to go ahead and use
- [19:58] this duck go search, right? So I will
- [20:00] just go ahead and click on create and
- [20:03] I'll say the agent is created the
- [20:05] creation successfully. Add the rate
- [20:06] agent in the conversation to use it. So
- [20:09] I'll just say use now. Now see add the
- [20:11] rate web search. If you just go ahead
- [20:12] and write add the rate web search, you
- [20:14] should be able to get it. So I want to
- [20:15] probably go ahead and directly do the
- [20:16] web search and I'll ask hey u what
- [20:20] is the agentic AI right? So this is my
- [20:24] question that I basically asking. Now
- [20:25] what is basically going to happen it is
- [20:27] just going to go ahead and probably tell
- [20:29] me to okay we are making a query to dug
- [20:32] go search. So it'll ask for the human
- [20:34] being like uh obviously uh the approval
- [20:37] of human right that is me uh whether we
- [20:40] should run this or not and always make
- [20:41] sure that you have to always uh see if
- [20:44] you just go ahead and auto run the
- [20:45] command with MCP tool if you just enable
- [20:47] it it'll not even ask you the permission
- [20:48] but don't do that it is necessary that
- [20:51] human should also give a permission to
- [20:52] this right so that it does not run by
- [20:55] its own you know so once I go ahead and
- [20:57] click on run now it is just going to go
- [20:59] ahead with the next step and it is
- [21:00] probably going to provide you the entire
- [21:02] that information. So this is how you
- [21:05] also go ahead and create a custom agent.
- [21:06] You can go ahead and do that. Uh as said
- [21:09] you can also go ahead and add your model
- [21:11] your own custom model. Just select the
- [21:12] provider, provide the API key and you
- [21:14] should be able to use it. Right? So we
- [21:16] have spoken about uh agents and now here
- [21:19] you can see that automatically in the
- [21:21] auto run also you can just set it up so
- [21:23] that you will be able to run your agent
- [21:25] automatically. Right? Uh here also you
- [21:27] have models. So if I probably go ahead
- [21:28] and see with respect to this you know we
- [21:30] have almost done each and everything we
- [21:32] built a lang chain AI assistant you can
- [21:34] build any kind of AI assistant
- [21:36] applications whatever along with front
- [21:38] end you could see that I did not
- [21:40] probably do much right you can also make
- [21:42] those changes uh you have an option of
- [21:44] this inbuilt and custom agents also we
- [21:47] have also seen how we can enable MCP
- [21:49] code repositories external data can how
- [21:51] it can also be provided in a context um
- [21:54] as we had probably created custom agents
- [21:57] with respect to the web search and all.
- [21:59] So yeah, I hope you like this particular
- [22:01] video and uh I definitely liked Treyai.
- [22:03] Again, thank you for sponsoring this
- [22:06] particular video. Definitely bringing it
- [22:07] in front of the entire people out there.
- [22:10] Definitely go ahead and try it out. All
- [22:11] the information regarding this will be
- [22:12] given in the description of this
- [22:14] particular video. This was it from my
- [22:15] side. I will see you in the next video.
- [22:17] Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye.
