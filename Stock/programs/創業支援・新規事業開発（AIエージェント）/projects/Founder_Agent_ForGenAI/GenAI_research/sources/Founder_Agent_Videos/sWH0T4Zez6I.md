- [00:00] Here's a bee. On its own, it can collect nectar, but that's about it. Now add thousands
- [00:07] of bees, and suddenly they're making honey. They're cooling the hive and defending it. That's exactly
- [00:13] how multi-agent systems work. Many simple AI agents, each with a small job,
- [00:20] coming together to solve big, complex problems. At its core, an AI agent is an
- [00:27] autonomous system that can perform tasks on behalf of another agent or another
- [00:34] system by designing its workflow and using available tools. And the performance of AI
- [00:40] agents depends on the large language model, or LLM, used to power them, as
- [00:47] well as their set of tools. And of course, a reasoning framework that dictates
- [00:54] how they take the output of these tools to make decisions. Multi-agent systems take this a step
- [01:01] further by allowing agents to remain autonomous, but also cooperate and coordinate in agent
- [01:07] structures. What are these structures look like? Let's start with a decentralized network.
- [01:15] Let's imagine you have several AI agents. Each of them
- [01:21] can communicate with one another to share information and resources to help
- [01:28] inform their decision process, each operating with the same amount of authority.
- [01:35] This is often referred to as an agent network.
- [01:42] There are also hierarchical structures which are tree like, and
- [01:49] they contain agents with varying levels of autonomy. The simplest example is a simple or
- [01:56] supervisor hierarchical structure in which one agent has the decision-making authority
- [02:02] over other agents. And by adding more layers
- [02:09] and more subtrees, we can make the system more complex.
- [02:17] There are many ways to distribute the authority here, for example, in uniform hierarchical
- [02:23] structures. All agents at the same level play the same role and have the same authority.
- [02:30] And the agents coordinate laterally, meaning at the top of the structure you might have a single
- [02:37] manager or a coordinator agent, and in the middle levels there are supervisor agents, each
- [02:44] managing a group of agents below them. And at the bottom these are the worker agents. So they're
- [02:50] directly performing the tasks. And this structure helps break down responsibilities. So, higher
- [02:57] levels coordinate. Lower levels execute. Let's keep in mind, though, that the authority doesn't have to
- [03:04] be strictly top down or centralized. It can also be distributed across sub-hierarchies, in
- [03:11] which one agent has the decision-making authority over other agents. Or maybe we
- [03:18] want the structure to be dynamic so that the authority shifts based on agent expertise or on
- [03:25] a situational basis. Now that we've covered the basics, let's talk about implementing these agents
- [03:32] in the real world. What are the advantages of using multi-agent systems over a
- [03:39] single agent? Well, to start they provide us with flexibility. This is
- [03:45] because multi-agent systems can adjust to varying environments by adding, removing or
- [03:52] adapting agents. Multi-agent systems also allow for scalability. And
- [03:59] the cooperation of several agents implies a greater pool of shared information, and this
- [04:06] collaboration allows these systems to solve more complex problems than a single agent could.
- [04:13] These systems also encourage domain specialization. in a single-agent structure, one agent
- [04:19] performs tasks in various domains, whereas each agent in a
- [04:26] multi-agent system can hold specific domain expertise. Perhaps one agent specializes in
- [04:33] synthesizing research papers, the other performs complex calculations and another specializes
- [04:39] in web search via an API. The last advantage I want to emphasize here is that, believe it or not,mult
- [04:46] multi-agent systems outperform single agents. And this is because the more
- [04:53] action plans that are available to an agent, the more learning and reflection occur. An AI agent
- [05:00] incorporating knowledge and feedback from other agents allows for a greater magnitude of
- [05:05] information synthesis. And of course, as with most things in life, there are some
- [05:11] challenges with building multi-agent systems. When they're built using the same LLMs, for example,
- [05:18] they can ex experience shared pitfalls and agent malfunctions.
- [05:25] Such weaknesses might cause a system-wide failure of all involved agents or expose
- [05:31] vulnerability to adverse attacks. Our choice of the LLM, among other factors,
- [05:37] impacts how effectively an agent performs, and this is why thorough training, testing and data
- [05:44] governance are critical to minimizing failures. Another challenge of building multi-agent
- [05:51] systems is coordination complexity. As developers, we're tasked
- [05:57] with enabling coordination and negotiation between agents so that they're not competing with
- [06:03] resources or simply overriding each other's outputs. Instead, agents need
- [06:10] mechanisms to share information, resolve conflicts and synchronize decisions in a way that
- [06:16] maximizes the collective performance rather than causing bottlenecks or contradictions. And
- [06:23] the last challenge we'll touch on here is the risk of unpredictable behavior.
- [06:30] Though this drawback in and of itself isn't unique to multi-agent systems, it can easily be
- [06:36] amplified. Typically, the more agents are involved, the greater the unpredictable behavior becomes.
- [06:42] All right. Now, if we want to avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen, when is it best to stick to
- [06:48] a single agent system versus a multi-agent system? Well, it depends on the task and our
- [06:55] objectives, right? If the problem is complex, and
- [07:01] perhaps it spans various domains. Maybe it has limited resources
- [07:11] or it needs to scale across changing environments. This is exactly
- [07:17] when a multi-agent system truly shines. If we want to
- [07:24] build on this restaurant analogy of cooks in the kitchen, for example, let's put it this way. One
- [07:31] chef is completely fine for a small kitchen, right? Think of it like making breakfast for yourself.
- [07:36] But if you're running a restaurant that serves different cuisines and desserts, etc., you'll want
- [07:42] the whole kitchen staff working in sync. I hope you found this video useful and if you have
