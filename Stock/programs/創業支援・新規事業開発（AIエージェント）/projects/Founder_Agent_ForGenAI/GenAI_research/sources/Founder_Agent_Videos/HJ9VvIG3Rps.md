- [00:00] It is no secret that Claude code sub
- [00:02] agents have changed the game for AI
- [00:04] coding. And today I'll show you how I
- [00:06] use them along with Archon to build an
- [00:08] AI agent factory. All I have to do is
- [00:11] describe at a high level the agent I
- [00:12] want to create. And then Claude Code
- [00:14] spins up an entire agentic workflow with
- [00:17] specialists to help me plan, create, and
- [00:20] validate my agent. It's a template that
- [00:22] I have available for you. And right now
- [00:23] I'll show you how it works. Now sub
- [00:25] agents are really just prompts. So it's
- [00:27] not anything new, but the highly
- [00:29] structured approach that we have to
- [00:30] define and execute them in cloud code is
- [00:33] a thing of beauty. With sub agents, we
- [00:35] get specialized agentic coders to handle
- [00:38] different parts of our development
- [00:39] workflow. And then with archon, we use
- [00:41] it to give knowledge to these sub aents
- [00:44] and to split the tasks between them. We
- [00:46] become the project manager of our
- [00:48] agents. And that my friend is the future
- [00:50] of agentic coding. So here is the sub
- [00:53] agent Asian factory template that I have
- [00:55] available for you in GitHub linked
- [00:57] below. You can take this and run with it
- [00:59] right now to build any agent that you
- [01:01] want. And the reason that I'm jumping
- [01:02] into this right now is because there is
- [01:04] a really helpful diagram in the readme
- [01:06] here to help us understand this agentic
- [01:08] workflow that I've created. And so very
- [01:10] simply, we have all of our sub aents
- [01:13] that we're using in this workflow
- [01:14] defined in ourcloud agents folder. These
- [01:17] are all markdown documents. I'll show
- [01:18] you how we create these in a little bit.
- [01:20] So that defines each of our sub aents
- [01:22] and then in our global rules and claw.md
- [01:24] I define the workflow exactly what order
- [01:27] we want to invoke these sub aents how we
- [01:29] want to do it like we want to invoke
- [01:31] some of them in parallel also speaking
- [01:32] to how we can use archon to help us
- [01:34] manage our knowledge and tasks if you
- [01:36] have the archon mcp server connected to
- [01:38] cloud code so we start with our user
- [01:41] request that goes into our primary cloud
- [01:44] code agent so no sub aents at this point
- [01:46] that's going to ask some clarifying
- [01:47] questions understand our requirements
- [01:49] and then set up all the tasks in archon,
- [01:52] distributing it between our different
- [01:53] sub aents and then it'll immediately
- [01:55] start prompting our planner. So we have
- [01:58] our podantic AI planner because pyantic
- [02:00] AI is the framework that I'm using for
- [02:02] this factory and it's going to based on
- [02:04] the requirements given from our primary
- [02:06] cloud code agent. That's the prompt
- [02:08] coming into our sub agent. It's going to
- [02:10] do some web research, look at the Pantic
- [02:12] AI documentation in Archon, use all of
- [02:14] that to help it create architecture and
- [02:16] best practices around the agent we want
- [02:18] to create, and then it'll output a
- [02:20] markdown document with its plan. We
- [02:23] definitely need to have a markdown
- [02:24] document outputed, and I'll show you we
- [02:26] have that in our planning folder right
- [02:27] here. So, it's going to create this uh
- [02:29] initial MD because remember sub aents
- [02:33] have their own context window. We don't
- [02:35] share conversation history between our
- [02:37] sub agents and our primary cloud code
- [02:39] agent. So we use these markdown files to
- [02:41] allow these sub aents to communicate
- [02:44] with each other and with our primary
- [02:46] cloud code agent. And so after we go
- [02:49] through the planning, then our primary
- [02:51] cloud code agent is going to kick off
- [02:53] three parallel sub aents. We're going to
- [02:55] plan the system prompt for our agent.
- [02:58] We're going to plan the different tools
- [02:59] that we need. And then we're also going
- [03:01] to plan the package dependencies and
- [03:03] also the agent dependencies, things like
- [03:06] API keys and database connections. And
- [03:08] so it's going to output, again going
- [03:09] back here, these three markdown
- [03:11] documents with its plan for building out
- [03:14] each of those. And so now at this point,
- [03:16] we've done a lot of context engineering.
- [03:18] We have the initial plan for our agent.
- [03:20] We know its system prompt. We know the
- [03:22] tools that we need and generally how
- [03:23] we're going to implement them, typically
- [03:24] with some pseudo code and the
- [03:26] dependencies that we have. So we really
- [03:28] do have this rich set of context to now
- [03:30] dive into the implementation. Now we
- [03:32] don't have an implementation specific
- [03:34] sub agent. This just goes to the primary
- [03:37] cloud code agent to write out all the
- [03:39] code for us. Then we prompt the
- [03:42] validator agent. And this is so crucial.
- [03:44] You always want to allow cloud code in
- [03:46] some way to validate its own work and
- [03:49] iterate on the things that it creates
- [03:50] like unit tests. And so our validator
- [03:52] sub agent is responsible for that. And
- [03:55] then after it creates all of its tests,
- [03:56] it's going to output a validation
- [03:58] report. We're going to make sure we're
- [04:00] good there. And then we will deliver the
- [04:01] final agent. So that is the workflow
- [04:04] that we have. And like I said,
- [04:06] everything here is orchestrated within
- [04:08] the global rules that we have defined in
- [04:09] our claw.md. So I speak to the trigger
- [04:12] here like this is when you should invoke
- [04:14] the sub agent workflow. I talk about
- [04:16] using archon and then I have the
- [04:18] complete workflow built here in the
- [04:19] different phases that I was just showing
- [04:21] you in the diagram. And a lot of this
- [04:23] could be a slash command as well. Slash
- [04:25] commands are your way to have packaged
- [04:27] up workflows in cloud code, but I just
- [04:29] wanted to keep this simple and have it
- [04:31] in the global rules here along with some
- [04:33] best practices that I have for building
- [04:34] agents with Pantic AI. So that's
- [04:36] everything that we have set up here. Now
- [04:38] I want to dive into sub agents with
- [04:40] cloud code a bit more with you. Then
- [04:42] we'll see this all in action and really
- [04:44] have things come together. And also I
- [04:46] just want to say here even if you aren't
- [04:47] interested in building AI agents with
- [04:49] cloud code specifically this kind of
- [04:51] workflow will apply no matter what you
- [04:54] want to create. And so going back to our
- [04:56] diagram here let's say you wanted to
- [04:58] build a front-end application for
- [04:59] example. Well there's still going to be
- [05:01] different components of your front end
- [05:03] that you can split up the planning and
- [05:04] execution between these different sub
- [05:06] aents building a similar kind of
- [05:08] workflow. So I hope this kind of can
- [05:10] inspire you to just think about how you
- [05:12] can take a problem like let's build a
- [05:14] front-end app and let's split it into
- [05:15] well we got our dependencies and then we
- [05:17] have our components and then we have our
- [05:19] CSS right like you can split into these
- [05:21] different things and plan separately
- [05:23] just like I'm doing with the system
- [05:24] prompts tools and dependencies for our
- [05:26] agents. So as I dive into how we can set
- [05:29] up these sub aents and coordinate them
- [05:31] together with global rules or slash
- [05:32] commands think about how this will apply
- [05:35] no matter what you want to make. All
- [05:37] right, so let's dive more into the
- [05:38] specifics of sub aents now. So I've got
- [05:40] the sub aents page of the cloud code
- [05:42] docs open right here. It's a great
- [05:44] resource that I'll also have linked
- [05:46] below. They got a quick start and they
- [05:47] also cover the key benefits of sub aents
- [05:49] which are really important to know. And
- [05:51] so we've talked about some of this a bit
- [05:53] already, but we have the specialized
- [05:54] expertise through the fine-tuned prompts
- [05:56] that we give each agent in the markdown
- [05:58] files. We have reusability, like
- [06:01] literally what I'm doing in this video,
- [06:02] I'm packaging up these sub aents to give
- [06:04] to you as a workflow. flexible
- [06:06] permissions. We can define the tools
- [06:08] that each sub agent has, even the model
- [06:09] that it uses like Opus, Sonnet or Haiku.
- [06:12] And then last but not least, we have the
- [06:13] whole idea of context preservation.
- [06:16] There's definitely pros and cons to
- [06:17] this, but these sub agents do not share
- [06:20] the conversation history with our
- [06:21] primary claude code agent. So, we have
- [06:24] to make sure that we're passing in all
- [06:25] the context the sub agent needs and then
- [06:27] outputting everything that our primary
- [06:29] agent needs. That's why we're working
- [06:30] with markdown files as output here. But
- [06:32] it's also very nice because we're
- [06:34] preventing pollution of the main
- [06:36] conversation. For example, all of the
- [06:38] web research and calls to the Archon MCP
- [06:41] for knowledge that our sub agents are
- [06:43] doing, that doesn't have to pollute the
- [06:45] primary conversation for our cloud code
- [06:48] instance. It's really nice to prevent us
- [06:50] getting to that point where we have to
- [06:52] autocompact the conversation in cloud
- [06:54] code, which is never a good thing and
- [06:55] leads to a lot of hallucinations. And
- [06:57] so, we're just keeping our conversation
- [06:59] very concise and directed. That's what
- [07:02] sub aents help us with. And to get
- [07:04] started, there's a couple of different
- [07:05] ways that we can create our first sub
- [07:08] agent. The easiest way to do so is with
- [07:10] the slash agents command. And so going
- [07:13] back to my IDE here, I have Cloud Code
- [07:15] open up and I'll just do slash agents.
- [07:17] So I'll go ahead and create a new agent.
- [07:18] I'll put it in the current project. You
- [07:20] can also make it global with this second
- [07:22] option. And then I will have Claude help
- [07:24] me generate this agent. So just like
- [07:26] with my agent factory that I have for
- [07:28] you, we can describe at a high level
- [07:30] what we want for the sub agent. and
- [07:31] it'll generate the full markdown that
- [07:33] it'll put within thecloud/ aents folder.
- [07:36] And so I can say I want to build a sub
- [07:39] agent that helps me define system
- [07:42] prompts for my AI agents in Python. So
- [07:46] I'll send this in. And now it'll go
- [07:48] ahead and generate the description, the
- [07:50] system prompt that we have within our
- [07:52] sub aents. Like for the validator, for
- [07:54] example, it's about to generate all of
- [07:55] this right here. And then there are just
- [07:57] a couple of other things that we get to
- [07:58] select once it's done there. So, I will
- [08:00] come back once we have this generated.
- [08:03] Next, we get to define the tools that we
- [08:04] want our sub agent to have access to.
- [08:06] I'll just do all just to keep it simple
- [08:08] here. And then we get to pick the model,
- [08:10] which is another really awesome thing
- [08:11] with sub aents. If there is a certain
- [08:13] part of your development workflow
- [08:15] handled by a sub aent that doesn't need
- [08:16] as much power in the LLM, you can save
- [08:18] tokens by using Haiku, for example. So,
- [08:21] I'll just have a balance here with
- [08:22] sonnet. Then, I'll pick the color that
- [08:23] it shows in the CLI when we invoke it.
- [08:25] Pink looks good here. So, there we go.
- [08:27] And now this is our system prompt
- [08:30] engineer. So it's going to create this
- [08:31] markdown file right here in the agents
- [08:33] folder. So I'll do enter to save. And
- [08:35] boom, there we go. We have our system
- [08:37] prompt engineer. And take a look at
- [08:38] this. We have everything at the top
- [08:40] describing our agent. We got the name.
- [08:42] We have the description, which by the
- [08:44] way, the description is how our primary
- [08:46] Claude code agent knows when to call
- [08:49] upon this sub aent. So it's important to
- [08:51] have things like examples here as well.
- [08:53] That's why Claude adds these
- [08:54] automatically. We define our model and
- [08:56] the color. And then the rest of this is
- [08:58] the system prompt. This is where we have
- [09:00] the specialized instructions for our sub
- [09:02] agent. And so this is generally what I
- [09:04] followed when I created all of these
- [09:07] other sub aents. I've got the name,
- [09:08] description, tools, and color. We got
- [09:10] our system prompt. That's our dependency
- [09:12] manager. Same kind of thing with our
- [09:13] planner, the tool integrator, the
- [09:16] validator. So I'm not going to go into
- [09:17] all these sub aents in great detail
- [09:19] here, but definitely dive in and take a
- [09:20] look at these if you want. I put a lot
- [09:23] of time into kind of iterating on these
- [09:26] sub agents after I created them with
- [09:28] slash agents. So I didn't just go with
- [09:30] whatever it spit out initially. I
- [09:32] cleaned things up, made it more concise,
- [09:34] made it fit more into the workflow that
- [09:36] I also have defined in the claw.md. So
- [09:39] yeah, really dive into this if you're
- [09:40] curious how I set up this workflow and
- [09:42] you want to see how you could adapt this
- [09:44] to whatever kind of software you want to
- [09:46] build with the help of cloud code. So
- [09:48] that's the primary way that you can set
- [09:50] up your sub agents. It's slash agent for
- [09:52] each one of them and then iterate on
- [09:54] them with the help of cloud code after.
- [09:56] Another strategy that I just want to
- [09:58] call out really quickly here and I tried
- [10:00] with this as well and it worked
- [10:02] extremely well. Just take the URL right
- [10:04] here for the sub aents docs. Go into
- [10:06] your archon and I'll have a link right
- [10:08] here to the intro video where I show you
- [10:10] how to set up archon if you want this
- [10:12] for yourself. Go add knowledge and then
- [10:14] paste in this link. This is going to
- [10:17] give the entire documentation for cloud
- [10:19] code including sub aents to our archon
- [10:22] knowledge base. So now cloud code
- [10:24] connected to the archon mcp server is
- [10:27] able to search through the sub aent
- [10:28] docs. It'll understand how to build
- [10:30] these markdown files and so that way we
- [10:32] can actually instruct claude code to
- [10:34] create all of these sub aents at once.
- [10:36] So we don't have to do slash agents for
- [10:39] each one of these and iterate on it. And
- [10:41] so yeah two approaches here. One of them
- [10:43] is more simple getting started with how
- [10:45] cloud code recommends creating your sub
- [10:46] aents and then another one is
- [10:48] specifically leveraging archon to build
- [10:50] all this at once. You can build all
- [10:51] these sub aents and even help you craft
- [10:54] the cloud.md
- [10:56] basically defining how we orchestrate
- [10:58] all of these agents in a workflow. And
- [11:01] so that's the key thing here is each of
- [11:02] these sub aents the system prompt and
- [11:05] description really describes how this
- [11:08] agent operates in isolation. When do you
- [11:10] want to use it? How does it work? And
- [11:12] then our global rules here, which again,
- [11:13] this could be a slash command. This
- [11:15] defines how we use all of these sub
- [11:17] agents together. The sponsor of today's
- [11:19] video is Lindy, a noode AI agent builder
- [11:22] that isn't just extremely powerful, but
- [11:24] it's also very easy to use. Plus, they
- [11:27] just dropped a massive update. Now,
- [11:29] Lindy has an agent builder, they have
- [11:31] team accounts, and now we have
- [11:33] autopilot. So, Lindy agents have access
- [11:36] to a computer and a web browser. First
- [11:38] up, we've got the agent builder. Think
- [11:40] of it like cursor but for building AI
- [11:42] agents specifically in Lindy. And so we
- [11:44] just prompt the agent that we want and
- [11:46] then it creates the full workflow for us
- [11:49] as a Lindy automation. So just as an
- [11:51] example right here I had it build an AI
- [11:53] agent that performs research on a lead
- [11:55] and drafts an email in Gmail. So this is
- [11:57] my conversation just super super simple.
- [12:00] It was so easy to build this and it
- [12:02] creates the full agent. So, it has these
- [12:04] skills here, the tools that it has to
- [12:06] search the lead with Replexity and draft
- [12:08] an email for the outreach with Gmail.
- [12:10] And just as an example here, I'm having
- [12:12] him research Mark Cuban and draft an
- [12:14] outreach email. So, it's going to start
- [12:15] with Replexity, then go to the Gmail
- [12:17] skill, and then we'll see our draft. And
- [12:19] boom, there we go. Our conversation is
- [12:21] done, and we have a draft Mark Cuban.
- [12:23] Obviously, I'm not going to send this,
- [12:24] but yeah, this automation is working
- [12:26] perfectly, and I didn't have to build it
- [12:28] myself. Next up, we've got Autopilot,
- [12:30] which gives Lindy the ability to
- [12:32] actually control your computer just like
- [12:34] a human would. It unlocks literally
- [12:36] every integration imaginable. Here you
- [12:38] can see a Lindy agent monitoring Twitter
- [12:40] for spam, identifying spammer patterns,
- [12:43] and automatically blocking without any
- [12:44] intervention from me. And finally, we
- [12:47] have team accounts in Lindy now, so I
- [12:49] can invite people in to collaborate on
- [12:51] these agents with me and deploy them
- [12:53] companywide. The automation
- [12:55] possibilities with Lindy really are
- [12:56] limitless, especially after their recent
- [12:58] updates. So, definitely check them out.
- [13:00] Link in the description to get started
- [13:02] for free, $20 worth of credits, which is
- [13:04] definitely enough to experience having a
- [13:06] full AI agent factory working for your
- [13:08] team. Now, the last thing that's really
- [13:10] important to hit on before we dive into
- [13:11] a demo, is how we are using markdown
- [13:13] files to efficiently communicate between
- [13:16] these different sub aents because none
- [13:17] of them share the same context. And so
- [13:20] phase zero after we ask for requirements
- [13:23] we're going to create a folder within
- [13:25] here. So when we do a third
- [13:27] implementation there'll be a third
- [13:28] folder that's created here. And all of
- [13:30] the planning documents are going to be
- [13:32] outputed there. And so going to our
- [13:34] planner to start things off. We're
- [13:36] specifically having it output a file
- [13:39] called initial.md within the planning
- [13:41] folder of the new agent that we're
- [13:43] creating. And so just to go to my rag
- [13:44] agent as the example for you, we have
- [13:47] this planning folder and this is where
- [13:48] we're outputting the initial MD. So
- [13:50] that's a part of our process defining
- [13:52] the inputs and outputs. And we also
- [13:54] specify some of this in the markdown
- [13:56] files for the sub aents themselves but
- [13:58] also having it here because it's
- [13:59] orchestrating the full workflow. And
- [14:01] then going into the parallel agents for
- [14:02] example with the prompt engineer we're
- [14:04] telling it your input is the initial MD
- [14:07] and then your output is going to be
- [14:09] again within the planning folder a
- [14:10] prompts.md. So we have the prompt come
- [14:13] into our engineer agent from the primary
- [14:17] cloud code instance and we're telling it
- [14:19] to look in initial MD. So those two
- [14:21] things together is the context for that
- [14:23] sub agent. So it reads this as its first
- [14:25] operation and then it's la the last
- [14:28] thing that it does is it outputs a
- [14:29] prompts.mmd and it's the same kind of
- [14:31] thing for the tool development agent.
- [14:33] It's got the similar inputs and outputs
- [14:35] and our dependency configuration agent.
- [14:38] So that is our way to bring in just the
- [14:40] context that we need for each sub agent
- [14:42] and then output just the context that we
- [14:44] need for the rest of the workflow
- [14:46] keeping our conversation compact and
- [14:48] very directed and focused on what we
- [14:50] need to get done. And then also
- [14:52] throughout this workflow we're
- [14:53] describing how we can use archon to
- [14:56] manage the knowledge and tasks that we
- [14:57] need for our implementation which also I
- [15:00] did make that optional because I don't
- [15:01] want to be one of those people that says
- [15:03] you have to use my tool. And so I am
- [15:05] describing what it's like to use archon,
- [15:07] but only if it is available. And so we
- [15:08] have that managing the whole workflow as
- [15:11] well, even assigning different tasks to
- [15:13] the different sub aents that we have in
- [15:14] each of our phases here. All right. So
- [15:17] now that we understand how sub agents
- [15:19] work and how I've set up this workflow,
- [15:21] now let's get into a demo. Let's see
- [15:22] this in action. And so what we're going
- [15:24] to be building here is the full example
- [15:26] that I have referenced at the top of
- [15:28] this readme, which by the way, this is
- [15:30] the readme in GitHub. This is what I'll
- [15:31] have linked in the description. It's a
- [15:33] part of the whole context engineering
- [15:35] intro repository that I've been doing a
- [15:37] lot of things around context engineering
- [15:38] for you with recently. So yeah, going
- [15:40] back here, we're just going to follow
- [15:42] the instructions in the getting started.
- [15:44] So we simply have a prompt to request
- [15:46] our agent. What do we want to build?
- [15:48] We'll answer some clarifying questions
- [15:50] that it asks for us. That's a part of
- [15:52] the workflow in phase zero. And then
- [15:54] we'll watch the magic. I'll show you in
- [15:56] real time these different sub aents
- [15:58] operating. We got the planner, then we
- [15:59] go into our parallel agents, then the
- [16:01] implementation, then the validation.
- [16:03] We'll see it all in action. We'll see
- [16:04] how it works with Archon as well. It's
- [16:06] really exciting. And then we'll get our
- [16:08] agent at the end. Like that's it. It is
- [16:09] really simple to work with this whole
- [16:11] template. And it all starts with a super
- [16:13] simple prompt. And I even have the
- [16:16] sample prompt as a part of this
- [16:18] repository for you if you want to see
- [16:19] the exact prompt that I'm about to
- [16:21] execute to build the agent that I have
- [16:24] in the demo here. So, this reference is
- [16:27] what we're about to build. So, I'll copy
- [16:29] this prompt. I'll do Ctrl J to open up
- [16:31] my terminal where I already have Cloud
- [16:33] Code opened up. And then I'll paste this
- [16:35] bad boy in. Now, before we run this, I
- [16:37] do want to set up a couple of things in
- [16:38] Archon. If you want to be using Archon
- [16:41] to make your implementation even more
- [16:43] reliable. And so, going back into the
- [16:45] browser here, the one thing that I'll
- [16:47] say is it helps a lot because this
- [16:50] factory is using Pyantic AI for our AI
- [16:53] agent framework. It's very helpful to
- [16:55] have the Pyantic AI documentation. And
- [16:57] so we have the LLM's-Lful.ext.
- [17:00] This is all of the Pyantic AI docs
- [17:02] curated into a single file to give to
- [17:04] LLM. And so I'll have this linked in the
- [17:06] description as well. If you want to set
- [17:07] up Archon, copy this URL, go in and add
- [17:10] the knowledge and crawl everything for
- [17:12] Pantic AI. I'm not going to do it now
- [17:13] because obviously it takes a good amount
- [17:15] of time to chunk and crawl everything.
- [17:17] But then you'll have the Pantic AI
- [17:19] crawled. You'll have about 430 code
- [17:21] examples if things are looking good. Now
- [17:23] through MCP, Cloud Code is able to use
- [17:25] Archon to search through the Pyantic AI
- [17:27] documentation just to make the
- [17:29] implementation more reliable. And then
- [17:31] we also want to create a project here.
- [17:33] So I'm going to go into my projects tab.
- [17:35] I already have one project created just
- [17:37] as I was prepping this for you. So I'm
- [17:39] going to create a brand new one with a
- [17:40] kind of a similar name. So new project.
- [17:42] I'll call this uh hybrid
- [17:45] search rag agent. And then for the
- [17:48] description here, I'm just going to
- [17:49] leave this nice and simple and do the
- [17:51] same thing as the title. But yeah, I'll
- [17:52] create this project. And now I'm
- [17:54] specifically going to tell Cloud Code in
- [17:56] my prompt to reference this new project.
- [17:59] So I want it to create all the tasks for
- [18:01] me. We can even have it so that it
- [18:03] stores the documents for our different
- [18:06] sub aents here as well. And I actually
- [18:08] did that as I was testing my
- [18:10] implementation earlier. So like we have
- [18:11] the output from the different sub aents,
- [18:13] these markdown documents. I actually
- [18:15] have them outputed and stored in Archon,
- [18:17] which is just a really cool way to store
- [18:19] all of the context in a database. So
- [18:21] even other people that want to use
- [18:23] archon along with us can reference these
- [18:25] same things. It's really cool. So yeah.
- [18:27] All right, we got our project set up
- [18:28] now. So I'm going to go back into claw
- [18:30] and I'm actually going to tell it to use
- [18:31] this project. I'll say use the hybrid
- [18:34] search rag agent project in archon. So
- [18:38] I'm just going to be explicit here
- [18:39] creating the project ahead of time. I
- [18:41] mean it also will just create it for you
- [18:43] if you don't have one, but yeah, I just
- [18:44] wanted to define that since I already
- [18:46] have a similar project in Archon. So
- [18:47] there we go. Now we're kicking off the
- [18:49] build. And because we're saying we want
- [18:50] to build an agent, that's going to
- [18:52] trigger the full workflow here. So there
- [18:54] we go. We're starting with our
- [18:55] clarifying questions. So off camera, I
- [18:57] just really quickly typed out answers to
- [18:59] each of its questions. It just wanted to
- [19:01] know a couple of things like what kind
- [19:02] of knowledge are we searching through
- [19:04] and how exactly do we want the agent to
- [19:05] output its findings? And so I'll send
- [19:07] this in. And then it's going to start by
- [19:10] creating some tasks for us in Archon to
- [19:12] help us orchestrate the usage of our sub
- [19:14] agent. So there we go. It's starting by
- [19:16] checking Archon. We are successfully
- [19:18] connected to the Archon MCP. And then
- [19:20] after it creates some tasks, we'll dive
- [19:22] into our first sub agent, the planner,
- [19:24] where it's going to output that initial
- [19:26] MD file. Once it does its planning and
- [19:29] because we're doing the web research and
- [19:30] all the Archon knowledge lookups within
- [19:32] that sub agent, it's not going to
- [19:34] pollute our conversation. And so I'll
- [19:36] actually show you really quickly. Uh,
- [19:38] something I want to call out that's
- [19:39] really interesting is this workflow is
- [19:42] actually very similar to the agent tier
- [19:45] that I had with the original version of
- [19:48] Archon. So, I turned it more now into
- [19:49] something where it's like task
- [19:50] management and knowledge for coding
- [19:52] assistance. Like this is the layer
- [19:54] between humans and coding assistants.
- [19:56] But the old Archon was an AI agent that
- [19:58] builds other agents. But really, it was
- [20:00] just a bunch of specialized sub aents
- [20:02] that I had to find through Langraph and
- [20:04] Pideantic AI. And so we start with the
- [20:07] planner and then we have our specialized
- [20:09] agents for the tools and dependencies
- [20:11] and prompt. Like this really is a a
- [20:14] version maybe a bit more of a complex
- [20:16] version of what we have now with sub
- [20:18] aents in cloud code. So just a little
- [20:19] interesting tidbit that I wanted to give
- [20:21] you there. But yeah, look at this. Now
- [20:23] we're setting up the tasks in archon.
- [20:25] And so I'll actually show this here.
- [20:27] I'll bring back over archon. We have
- [20:29] requirement analysis and system prompt
- [20:30] design as the two tasks that's created
- [20:32] so far. And take a look at this. It even
- [20:34] has it assigned to the right sub agent.
- [20:36] So the requirement analysis is done by
- [20:37] the podantic AI planner and then the
- [20:39] prompt engineer is doing the system
- [20:41] prompt design. Absolutely beautiful. And
- [20:43] it's just going to keep creating more
- [20:44] and more tasks here. Like I'll show you
- [20:46] that we have it updated here. Like
- [20:47] there's even more tasks now. And each
- [20:49] one is assigned to the right agent. Like
- [20:51] when we do the actual implementation,
- [20:53] it's correct here that it's using cloud
- [20:54] code, the primary coding. We're not
- [20:56] using a sub agent in this case. So yeah,
- [20:59] it's creating all the tasks and then
- [21:00] we'll move on to the planner. So I'll
- [21:02] skip ahead once we got to that point.
- [21:04] All right. So it moved the task to doing
- [21:06] for the planning. So if we go back into
- [21:09] archon here, we can see that yep, we are
- [21:11] about to execute the pyantic AI planner
- [21:13] for requirements analysis. And there we
- [21:16] go. We got the blue popup here. We're
- [21:18] calling into this sub agent. And by the
- [21:21] way, the planner agent is where you
- [21:23] could integrate the PRP framework or
- [21:25] something like BMAD if you wanted. I'm
- [21:27] keeping this simple by just using sub
- [21:29] aents. So not using a more advanced
- [21:31] context engineering strategy like PRP,
- [21:33] but I'm not just ditching PRP. I'm only
- [21:35] excluding it to keep things simple here.
- [21:37] But you could definitely like generate a
- [21:38] PRP as a part of your planner sub agent.
- [21:41] So yeah, I'll let this go for a while.
- [21:43] It's going to do a lot of web search.
- [21:45] It's going to look at the Pantic AI
- [21:47] documentation through Archon. So it'll
- [21:49] take its time. I'll pause and come back
- [21:51] once we move on to the next phase. There
- [21:53] we go. We completed our planner agent.
- [21:56] Took 1 minute. Took almost 30,000
- [21:58] tokens. a lot of research that it did
- [22:00] for us. And then it updated the task,
- [22:02] marked it as done in Archon, and now
- [22:03] it's moving on to invoking our parallel
- [22:06] agents. So, it's updating all three of
- [22:07] these tasks to doing. And then in a
- [22:09] second here, we'll see the fancy colors
- [22:11] pop up for these three agents all
- [22:13] running in parallel. And in the
- [22:15] meantime, oh, there we go. All right.
- [22:16] Now, it's popping up. So, we got orange
- [22:17] for our prompt engineer. And so, it's
- [22:19] taking its time crafting the prompt to
- [22:21] send into the sub agent. So, it finishes
- [22:23] that. Now, it moves on to our tool
- [22:24] integrator. And we can see that these
- [22:27] these dots right here are not blinking
- [22:28] yet because it's waiting for all three.
- [22:30] There we go. Now they're all invoked at
- [22:32] the exact same time once we have the
- [22:33] prompts sent into each of them. And now
- [22:35] they are off doing their own thing each
- [22:38] rep starting by reading the initial MD
- [22:40] exactly as we planned. And they're going
- [22:42] to output markdown files in the end. So
- [22:44] if we go in the agents folder, go into
- [22:46] no not rag agent hybrid search agent and
- [22:48] into the planning folder. Right now
- [22:50] we've got our initial MD. So this is
- [22:52] what our planner agent outputed. and
- [22:53] then each of our parallel agents red.
- [22:56] And so, yeah, the last thing I'll show
- [22:57] you really quick is if I go back into
- [22:59] Archon for task management. Just a
- [23:01] beautiful thing. So, we completed our
- [23:02] requirements analysis. Now, we're in
- [23:04] progress for all three of our sub aents
- [23:07] that each have a task assigned to them.
- [23:08] This is a thing of beauty. So, all
- [23:11] right, I will come back again once our
- [23:13] parallel agents are done and we've got
- [23:15] all the files in planning. Okay, this is
- [23:18] actually blazing fast. like it only took
- [23:20] a minute here because we just had to
- [23:22] wait for the slowest parallel agent. And
- [23:23] now we're already moving on to the main
- [23:25] implementation. So I'm going to close
- [23:27] out of the terminal here and show you.
- [23:28] We got our dependencies. We've got our
- [23:31] initial MD. We have our prompts. So our
- [23:33] the system prompt for our agent. And
- [23:35] then we have the general tools that we
- [23:36] need for our semantic search and then
- [23:38] also our hybrid search. So this is
- [23:40] looking fantastic. This is all the
- [23:43] context we need now. So going back to
- [23:45] our primary claude agent and we can see
- [23:47] this going back into archon here that
- [23:49] now the current agent cla code is doing
- [23:52] the implementation. This is not a sub
- [23:54] agent right now and it's going to be
- [23:55] reading in all these files. This is our
- [23:57] complete context engineering. And so
- [23:59] going back to my terminal, let me scroll
- [24:01] down. Okay. Yep. So now we're doing some
- [24:03] rag searches with archon to understand
- [24:05] padantic AI. How to specifically
- [24:07] implement the agent that we requested.
- [24:09] Searching some code examples as well. So
- [24:11] this is just so cool how we're seeing
- [24:13] Archon in action, all these other parts
- [24:15] of context engineering coming into the
- [24:17] fold with sub aents. So yeah, I'm going
- [24:19] to come back again once we're done with
- [24:20] the implementation and we move on to
- [24:22] that last sub agent for our validator.
- [24:25] And there we go. We have our complete AI
- [24:28] agent built for us now. Our hybrid
- [24:29] search rag agent. So we had the
- [24:31] validator that ran here actually for
- [24:33] quite a while because it takes some time
- [24:35] to iterate on the unit tests to make
- [24:36] sure everything's polished for us. But
- [24:38] then it updated everything in archon and
- [24:40] wrote out some documentation. So you can
- [24:41] see here that we have all the tasks
- [24:43] complete now in archon. Take a look at
- [24:45] that. And so what we built just now that
- [24:48] actually is the full hybrid search rag
- [24:50] agent that I linked to at the top of the
- [24:52] readme. So you can check this out if you
- [24:54] want. You can look into how it was
- [24:55] built, learn from it, try the thing
- [24:57] yourself. It's a fully working AI agent.
- [24:59] I only had to iterate two times to fix
- [25:01] it up. So I'll save you the boring
- [25:03] details of having to iterate on this.
- [25:05] I'll just show screenshots right here
- [25:07] really quickly of the things that
- [25:08] weren't working immediately. Just some
- [25:10] database type issues that I fixed up in
- [25:12] two more prompts. So, we threehotted
- [25:14] this hybrid search agent and the rag
- [25:16] pipeline already came. But yeah, it's
- [25:18] super super cool. So, I'll go over and
- [25:20] show you a demo really quickly. Now,
- [25:21] I've got my environment already set up.
- [25:23] So, I'll just run the CLI command like
- [25:24] we have in the readme here and we can
- [25:26] just do a quick demo of this thing. So,
- [25:28] I can say for example, how are AWS and
- [25:32] Anthropic partnered up? So this is just
- [25:34] one of the documents that I have in my
- [25:35] knowledge base from that rag pipeline.
- [25:37] And yeah, if you guys didn't know, AWS
- [25:40] is where all of the cloud LLM inference
- [25:42] is run. It's run on AWS infrastructure.
- [25:44] Super cool. So yeah, we can just ask
- [25:46] another question as well. Uh like tell
- [25:48] me about the cloud wars. Just another
- [25:50] thing I know is in my knowledge base. So
- [25:52] yeah, just a quick demo to show you what
- [25:54] we were able to create thanks to the
- [25:56] power of this agentic workflow using sub
- [25:59] agents to have all these specialized
- [26:01] agents operating in different stages of
- [26:03] our development. Super super cool. We
- [26:05] use archon to give all the knowledge
- [26:08] around pyantic AI and also for the task
- [26:11] management. So we are project manager
- [26:12] throughout this entire thing too. Super
- [26:14] super cool. So, that's everything that
- [26:16] I've got for this sub aent template
- [26:19] available for you to try right now. I
- [26:22] hope that you enjoyed this, got a lot
- [26:24] out of it. If you appreciated this video
- [26:25] and you're looking forward to more
- [26:27] things on AI agents and AI coding, I
- [26:29] would appreciate a like and a subscribe.
- [26:31] And with that, I will see you in the
- [26:33] next video.
