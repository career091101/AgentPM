- [00:09] - Welcome to the AWS
Executive Insights podcast.
- [00:12] My name's Stephen Brozovich.
- [00:13] I'm part of our Enterprise
Strategy team at AWS.
- [00:15] I'm joined by my colleagues
Jake Burns and Miriam McLemore.
- [00:18] Today, we're going to
be spending time talking
- [00:20] a little bit about the
impact of agentic AI
- [00:23] on modern organizations.
- [00:24] And we spend a lot of time talking
- [00:26] to customers in our day to day.
- [00:28] So I'm curious, what are
the things you're hearing
- [00:30] from customers about the changes
and impact that agentic AI
- [00:33] are having on their organizations?
- [00:36] - Yeah, Stephen,
- [00:38] I think, and Jake I'm sure
you're hearing the same,
- [00:42] they're trying to figure out
how do I upskill my team?
- [00:46] Do I need to hire new talent as well?
- [00:50] How do I mix it?
- [00:52] What does the org look like?
- [00:54] And they're asking all
the questions, right?
- [00:58] This is not just a new technology
- [01:02] to train the tech stack.
- [01:04] This is full business engagement.
- [01:08] - Yeah.
- [01:09] - Is that what you're hearing?
- [01:10] - Yeah, absolutely.
- [01:11] So, if we're talking about agentic AI,
- [01:13] I'm still hearing a lot of questions
- [01:15] about what it is exactly.
- [01:17] And to be honest, I think
at this moment in time,
- [01:19] there's several definitions.
- [01:21] So it's an interesting question to answer.
- [01:23] But in terms of the workforce,
- [01:25] it's kind of like what we saw with cloud,
- [01:27] but just far faster and much
higher impact, I would say.
- [01:31] So how do we leverage this technology
- [01:34] in order to make our
employees more productive,
- [01:37] but actually do things that
they weren't able to do before
- [01:40] and make their jobs more fulfilling?
- [01:41] That's the key, I think, for this.
- [01:43] - Well, and you're seeing this
have such a broader impact.
- [01:46] I mean, you mentioned cloud.
- [01:47] Cloud primarily affected
your tech employees.
- [01:50] It was a new way of kind of doing tech
- [01:52] or deploying product,
building on technology.
- [01:55] Agentic actually opens the
doors for transformation
- [01:57] across the entire enterprise
in a really interesting way.
- [02:01] And so I'm finding a lot of our customers
- [02:03] are maybe even struggling with
- [02:04] what even is our business,
- [02:06] or how do we even approach this space
- [02:09] now that there are so many
different possibilities?
- [02:12] So as you've walked customers through
- [02:14] or had these conversations,
- [02:15] what are some patterns you're seeing
- [02:16] that are starting to emerge
- [02:17] that are maybe helping
differentiate those customers
- [02:20] that are able to face the challenge well,
- [02:22] and those customers that
really feel at a loss?
- [02:25] - Yeah, the thing that I'm seeing,
- [02:28] and it's actually something
we've talked about
- [02:31] for a long time, which
is integrating teams.
- [02:35] Because I agree with you, Stephen,
- [02:36] cloud was, unfortunately,
often regulated just to IT.
- [02:41] It shouldn't have been, right?
- [02:43] The business needs to understand
what they're accomplishing.
- [02:48] But with agentic,
- [02:51] it is a change of how the
business will operate,
- [02:56] and it requires those integrated teams
- [03:00] that are focused on business
outcomes to be successful.
- [03:05] Or at least that's the companies
- [03:07] that I'm seeing make progress.
- Yeah.
- [03:10] - Versus the ones waiting in the wings.
- [03:12] - Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- [03:15] I mean, there's such a wide
range of topics on this,
- [03:19] all from level of acceptance
that this is happening
- [03:23] and that there's a sense of urgency.
- [03:25] So there's levels to that.
- [03:27] But then the ones that
are actually doing things,
- [03:29] the ones that I predict
will be very successful
- [03:31] is anybody who is in
charge of data, right?
- [03:34] Those people overnight
- [03:35] became much, much more valuable
to these organizations.
- [03:38] And anyone who's in charge
of data with agentic AI,
- [03:41] they now, overnight, became
- [03:43] one of the most important
people in the entire company.
- [03:46] Because data really is your
differentiator with agentic AI.
- [03:48] And so the ones that are very smart,
- [03:50] that are thinking ahead,
- [03:51] they're really getting their data in order
- [03:53] because they're realizing
that this technology,
- [03:56] if we're being honest, is going
to become very commoditized.
- [03:59] Everyone has access to
it, and that's a feature.
- [04:02] But what's going to make you different
- [04:04] than this new startup?
- [04:06] If you're an enterprise
- [04:07] that's been collecting data
for, sometimes, decades,
- [04:10] and you have all of this proprietary data,
- [04:12] that's your competitive advantage,
- [04:14] but only if it's out of silos,
- [04:16] only if it's accessible to this technology
- [04:18] and only if your employees know
- [04:19] how to use this technology
to leverage that data.
- [04:22] - I completely agree.
- [04:24] Because there used
- [04:26] to be a mindset in many organizations,
- [04:29] "data is power", right?
- [04:31] And so I'm going to hold
and control my data,
- [04:34] and certainly security of data
- [04:37] is always going to be, still is, critical.
- [04:43] But we have to start with
what is the business outcome
- [04:48] that organization is trying to drive
- [04:51] and identify the right data.
- [04:53] Because I've lived in organizations
- [04:57] where we just collected data just in case.
- [05:00] We might need it someday.
- [05:02] - Yeah.
- [05:03] - Right now, we're going
to integrate, finally,
- [05:05] structured and unstructured
data to drive outcomes.
- [05:09] And that's a different
mindset for data management,
- [05:13] data governance, data ownership.
- [05:16] - So you both brought up the importance
- [05:17] and the value maybe of the data
- [05:19] that the organization already has.
- [05:21] One of the patterns I'm
seeing about companies
- [05:23] that are really being more successful
- [05:24] in adopting the technology is
when they clearly understand
- [05:27] what their differentiator
actually is in the market.
- [05:30] Because what we're seeing
- [05:31] is the path to go from
idea to implementation
- [05:35] is potentially drastically shortened
- [05:39] through the use of these
new tools and technologies.
- [05:41] And so now it really becomes
critical to really understand
- [05:44] what is the thing that really
distinguishes my business
- [05:47] from other businesses,
- [05:49] and how do I connect that business value?
- [05:51] It has to be connected to
that differentiated piece.
- [05:54] Because just to be frank,
- [05:55] the undifferentiated
workloads are the ones
- [05:58] that are going to
continue to get shortened
- [05:59] and continue to go away.
- [06:01] Roles that support undifferentiated
work are likely the ones
- [06:06] that are going to be most
impacted by this type of change.
- [06:09] What else maybe are you
seeing in terms of the people
- [06:11] and the talent impact for this effort?
- [06:15] - Well, there's so much there, Stephen,
- [06:16] and I think you hit the nail on the head.
- [06:18] So data is your differentiator.
- [06:20] The other half of that
- [06:21] is your workforce's ability
to use this technology.
- [06:26] I think that's your differentiator.
- [06:28] So, for all the organizations
- [06:29] that are out there that
maybe aren't sitting
- [06:31] on a massive trove of data,
- [06:32] didn't have someone like Miriam there
- [06:35] who just stored it away just in case,
- [06:37] there's still hope because I think it's,
- [06:39] I don't know what the split is,
- [06:40] 50/50 in terms of impact, we'll see.
- [06:42] But perhaps even more
important than the data,
- [06:45] in fact, is your employee's
willingness to use it
- [06:49] and ability to use it.
- [06:50] And willingness to learn
and adapt and change.
- [06:52] I mean, this has been
true for quite a while,
- [06:54] but I'd say it's becoming more true.
- [06:56] The most important attribute
you can have as an employee,
- [07:00] or as an organization,
is your ability to adapt
- [07:03] and adapt quickly.
- [07:04] And the speed at which
you have to do that,
- [07:07] it's picking up, it's getting faster.
- [07:09] - And I couldn't agree
with you more, agility,
- [07:13] and we've been preaching agility,
- [07:16] agile working methods, all
the things for a long time.
- [07:20] But now it's not a choice.
- [07:22] And it's not just IT.
- [07:23] It's not just agile methods in IT.
- [07:27] It is an integrated business, technology,
- [07:31] data, security team that comes together
- [07:36] to drive an outcome.
- [07:38] And that way of working,
- [07:40] to your question about talent and skills,
- [07:44] is different from most organizations.
- [07:48] - I mean, we've been seeing
this trend for a while now.
- [07:51] A lot of organizations that
maybe are still operating
- [07:53] almost in an industrial mindset
- [07:55] where you add three widgets
- [07:56] and you get a particular outcome.
- [07:58] And we know really, I mean,
- [07:59] I think about deterministic
and non-deterministic outcomes.
- [08:03] And what this is really enabling
- [08:04] is experimentation at very low
cost and at very high speed,
- [08:08] which means we don't have
- [08:09] to be tied to this old
way of thinking that says,
- [08:12] "This is my input, thus
I will get this output."
- [08:15] In fact, some of the challenges
- [08:16] I think our customers
are running into is that
- [08:18] even their reward structure
within their organization
- [08:21] is making an assumption
- [08:23] that I can decide something in January,
- [08:25] and I will know it's the right
thing to do 12 months later
- [08:28] so that you get a bonus.
- [08:29] What are some of the maybe disincentives
- [08:32] that you're seeing in customers
- [08:33] that are maybe working
against their desire
- [08:36] to shift to a more agile mindset?
- [08:39] - And that's such an important point
- [08:42] because, okay, so we
talk about technology.
- [08:46] We changed the technology team.
- [08:48] Now we're integrating the
business teams into that.
- [08:52] We're figuring out how
to fund it with finance.
- [08:55] But often HR is left out.
- [08:58] And we have to have different
mechanisms for reward
- [09:04] and identifying what's good.
- [09:07] What's a behavior that we want to incent,
- [09:11] and what are behaviors
that we want to deprecate?
- [09:15] - And we want to incent experimentation.
- [09:17] - Yeah.
- [09:18] - And I would say we should
have been doing that all along,
- [09:20] but now it's a necessity.
- [09:21] It's an existential necessity I would say.
- [09:24] You have to reward experimentation.
- [09:26] And I think where there's a couple areas
- [09:28] where I see customers getting
this maybe slightly wrong.
- [09:31] One is that they're rewarding adoption,
- [09:34] and adoption is not
experimentation, right?
- [09:36] Just because I logged into
the tool and I did something,
- [09:38] that's exactly how I did things before
- [09:40] or try to replicate that.
- [09:41] That's not experimentation.
- [09:43] We have to reward real experimentation.
- [09:45] And the problem is in
a lot of organizations,
- [09:47] that kind of experimentation
is actually punished.
- [09:49] - Yes.
- [09:50] - The second problem I see is
- [09:52] kind of conflating the idea of governance
- [09:54] and innovation and experimentation.
- [09:56] And this goes back to kind
of your original question,
- [09:59] which is what are customers asking,
- [10:01] for guidance on?
- [10:02] And one of the big ones
is, how do we balance that?
- [10:05] How do we innovate, how do we experiment
- [10:07] while at the same time put in,
- [10:10] very sensible governance?
- [10:12] Which it can look like a trade-off.
- [10:14] I don't think it has to be one,
- [10:15] but I think that's one of
the major problems to solve.
- [10:17] And if you get that right,
- [10:18] I think that you can
get a lot of this right.
- [10:20] - Well, and that's where
leadership has to show up, right?
- [10:24] Because this just expecting
the teams to figure it out
- [10:28] without leaders actually demonstrating
- [10:32] that taking risk is going
to be rewarded, right?
- [10:35] And we're going to learn when
- [10:38] it doesn't work out exactly
as we anticipate it.
- [10:41] - Yeah.
- [10:42] - And that, again, it's
a new muscle for teams.
- [10:47] - Well and I think, I mean,
- [10:47] the leaders impact on
organizational culture is huge.
- [10:51] And so if I'm trying to foster
- [10:52] a spirit of innovation
and experimentation,
- [10:54] I do actually sometimes need to go back
- [10:56] and even look at the promotion process.
- [10:59] Because I could advocate
- [11:00] for innovation, et cetera, et cetera.
- [11:02] But then look at the last
10 people who got promoted,
- [11:04] and what are the actual
behaviors that we are rewarding?
- [11:07] So I spent a lot of
time with our customers
- [11:09] talking about organizational culture.
- [11:11] And in my mind, that shows
up in how we make decisions
- [11:15] and which behaviors are actually rewarded.
- [11:17] You've got your company statement
- [11:19] and your values,
- [11:20] but unless your actual business practices
- [11:24] are living into those values,
this is going to be an area
- [11:28] where you really, really struggle.
- [11:30] And I would say when you
have those clear values
- [11:32] and they're being
reinforced by the business,
- [11:34] that's what actually can create
- [11:35] some of those governance models.
- [11:37] It's kind of autonomy
- [11:38] with mental model guardrails
around decision-making,
- [11:41] along, clearly, with the automated
guardrails of technology.
- [11:46] But all of those things together
- [11:47] to really create the right infrastructure
- [11:49] so that those teams can
actually be successful.
- [11:52] - Yeah, and then communicate that.
- [11:55] I don't know if your
experience is like mine.
- [11:57] But the corporate rumor network
- [12:00] was the fastest way to find out
- [12:02] what was really the
company value statements.
- [12:05] - Yeah.
- [12:06] - And so having leadership authentically
- [12:10] talk about a risk we took,
an experiment we did,
- [12:15] how we did it, and what the outcome was
- [12:20] is so important.
- [12:22] Because there's going to be
people on the team that go,
- [12:25] "Oh, thank god.
The rules are finally done.
- [12:28] I can go cowboy my way
right into the future."
- [12:32] And that's also not what
we're looking for, right?
- [12:35] Security, identity, access management,
- [12:38] all those things are
still absolutely critical.
- [12:42] - If not even more critical.
- [12:43] And, you know, one of
the challenges I do see
- [12:45] is companies that have really advocated.
- [12:47] They say, "We're
democratizing everything,"
- [12:49] and they don't put the right
kind of guardrails in place,
- [12:51] both from a technology
and a mindset perspective.
- [12:54] The problem is you run
into reputational risk.
- [12:57] You put something out there in the market
- [12:58] that could actually do
significant trust damage
- [13:01] - [Miriam] Yes.
- [13:02] - to your brand and to your organization.
- [13:04] What are you seeing, Jake,
- [13:05] as far as maybe controls around that,
- [13:06] or even the mental models
that people are deploying
- [13:09] to be successful in creating that space?
- [13:12] - I mean, there's been
- [13:12] some high profile examples of that, right?
- [13:15] And I think probably
everyone is familiar with it.
- [13:17] If not, you can search for it.
- [13:19] But you alluded to something earlier
- [13:20] and Miriam touched on it, I
think it was super important.
- [13:23] It's that disconnect
between what leaders say
- [13:25] and what the incentive
structure actually incentivizes.
- [13:29] And I think that's one
of the biggest problems
- [13:32] that we're seeing right
now and it's getting worse.
- [13:34] So how do we overcome
that is the real question.
- [13:37] I would say something Miriam said,
- [13:38] it's that rumor network.
- [13:40] It's really the fastest
communication network in the world.
- [13:42] - Yep.
- [13:45] - As leaders, we need feedback loops.
- [13:47] We need to really understand
- [13:50] what's going on in that rumor network,
- [13:51] which means we have to
talk to our employees.
- [13:53] So a big anti-pattern that
I see, even before this,
- [13:58] but with agentic AI, it's just
everything's moving faster.
- [14:02] And it's this thing where
you're getting information
- [14:05] from your directs and
that's being filtered
- [14:08] by their directs and so forth and so on.
- [14:10] It's this game of telephone.
- [14:11] And you're living in a bubble, right?
- [14:13] You're surrounding yourself
with a reality distortion field,
- [14:16] but not in a good way, right?
- [14:18] So it's a real easy
problem to solve though.
- [14:21] Just go talk to your employees.
- [14:22] You have to earn their trust
so they'll be honest with you.
- [14:25] But have some of those employees
- [14:27] maybe directly report in to you.
- [14:28] Maybe have some of those employees,
- [14:30] maybe it's like one step removed
- [14:31] where you have people who are trusted,
- [14:33] who are in those communities,
- [14:35] who know what's actually being said
- [14:36] and what's actually being done
- [14:37] and how employees are
getting around the rules
- [14:39] and what they're doing.
- [14:40] And talk to those people.
- [14:42] But you really have to have
that feedback loop of truth.
- [14:45] That's the key.
- [14:46] - Well, and then paying attention
- [14:47] to what's actually happening
- [14:48] with the talent across the organization.
- [14:51] A lot of people are very
concerned right now.
- [14:53] - Yes.
- [14:54] - A lot of employees in many organizations
- [14:56] are actually asking themselves
- [14:57] fairly existential questions about,
- [15:00] "I knew what my job was.
- [15:01] I don't know what my job is going to be."
- [15:03] And I think that's
generally going to be true
- [15:05] for everybody in this age.
- [15:06] - [Jake] Sure.
- [15:07] - Now as you think and you've talked about
- [15:09] the customers you've worked with,
- [15:12] how are they thinking about
the attraction of talent
- [15:16] in this uncertain environment?
- [15:17] What are you hearing?
- [15:19] - All right, I guess I'm going
to have to add a third thing.
- [15:21] If the data is your differentiator,
- [15:22] their ability to use the technology,
- [15:24] the third is going to be
- [15:26] can you upskill your current employees?
- [15:27] And the reason why...
It's not just
- [15:29] because it's the right thing to do,
- [15:30] it's not just because it's easier to do.
- [15:32] Good luck hiring an
agentic AI engineer, right?
- [15:35] Let's be honest,
- [15:36] especially if you're an insurance company.
- [15:38] You're not in big tech, right?
- [15:41] The key to all of being
successful with this
- [15:43] is taking your existing employees,
- [15:45] first of all, making them
see this not as a threat,
- [15:47] but as an opportunity,
because it really is.
- [15:49] It's both depending on how they act.
- [15:51] But it really is a huge opportunity,
- [15:53] and I would say an unprecedented one.
- [15:55] - [Stephen] Yeah.
- [15:55] - Get them to see that point of view.
- [15:58] So be a good leader and communicate
- [16:00] and inspire them.
- [16:03] Give them the tools and
the test environments
- [16:06] so they can innovate and
run those experiments
- [16:08] in a safe way with guardrails,
- [16:09] with all of that, with strong governance.
- [16:12] And then incentivize them
- [16:13] to do those experiments and to learn.
- [16:15] And I think, I know it's a lot,
- [16:17] but those are the things
- [16:18] that you should have been
doing anyway I would argue.
- [16:20] - [Stephen] Yeah.
- [16:21] - It's just so much more important now.
- [16:22] And to answer your question more directly,
- [16:24] I would say you shouldn't be
primarily looking to the market
- [16:27] and trying to attract those people.
- [16:29] I do have an answer for that,
- [16:30] and I think there's a place for that.
- [16:32] But I think your default should be
- [16:34] to use the people you have.
- [16:35] And the reason is because they understand
- [16:37] how your organization works already.
- [16:39] And that's very difficult
to teach to new people.
- [16:42] And you can leverage that.
- [16:43] Just like you can leverage your data,
- [16:44] you can leverage that tribal knowledge
- [16:46] and that institutional knowledge
- [16:48] and those relationships and all of that.
- [16:50] Put this technology on top of it,
- [16:52] and then you have something very powerful.
- [16:53] - Well, and you go back
to that rumor network.
- [16:56] People are going to know if your company
- [16:59] is a good place to work
- [17:01] because they're going to talk to people.
- [17:03] They're going to hear about,
are you training people?
- [17:08] Are you making it a safe
place to experiment?
- [17:13] And that reputation of you as an employer
- [17:19] in this world of hiring and attracting
- [17:22] and keeping talent is critical.
- [17:25] And having a purpose and an approach,
- [17:28] because some organizations
are going down the path
- [17:32] of just mass training.
- [17:34] "Look, we trained you."
- [17:35] We have found that's not
the effective way to go.
- [17:39] We found that it's much more effective
- [17:41] if you have a business outcome
- [17:43] and a project that
you're going to work on,
- [17:46] bring the team together,
get trained as a group,
- [17:50] learn together, share ideas,
- [17:53] and that creates some culture.
- [17:56] But culture's important.
- [17:57] We very much believe that at Amazon.
- [18:01] - So, Miriam, you touched
- [18:02] on the organizational
culture aspect of the talent,
- [18:06] and, Jake, as you mentioned as well,
- [18:08] when we see companies that are,
- [18:09] "Oh, I need to hire a bunch of people,"
- [18:11] they're not seeing the benefit
- [18:14] that they have of their current workforce.
- [18:16] Not just in terms of, "I don't
have to hire more people,"
- [18:19] but in terms of the cultural
aspects of the organization.
- [18:22] I often get this question
from companies about,
- [18:24] "Well, how do you attract
new tech talent?""
- [18:27] And my question to them is,
"Who are your best people?
- [18:31] Do you even know why they are there?"
- [18:33] And chances are that's
what's differentiating you
- [18:36] in employees' eyes.
- [18:37] It's probably not the perks
- [18:39] or even the tech stack
that they get to work on.
- [18:41] It's the organizational culture.
- [18:43] And if we can foster
that spirit of culture,
- [18:45] that's actually what's going to drive
- [18:47] our ability to attract and retain talent.
- [18:48] - Completely.
- Absolutely.
- [18:50] How you do it is you become
the type of organization
- [18:53] that top talent wants to work for.
- [18:54] - [Stephen] Yeah.
- [18:57] - You become that and
then they come to you.
- [18:59] And to your point, okay,
- [19:01] free lunches are cool,
- [19:02] the vending machine you
don't have to put money in,
- [19:04] and all of that.
- [19:04] And of course pay is important.
- [19:06] But I would even argue that more important
- [19:08] for high performers,
- [19:09] because it's different
for different cohorts,
- [19:11] but the top, top performers,
- [19:12] what they care about most is
- [19:14] that they have an opportunity
to continue to grow,
- [19:16] to work on very interesting
projects with people like them,
- [19:21] so chances to collaborate
with other smart people
- [19:23] in an organization that
encourages collaboration
- [19:26] so that they can grow their skill sets,
- [19:28] that they can do interesting work
- [19:29] and, leave a legacy, right?
- [19:32] - And be connected to a purpose...
- [19:33] - Absolutely.
- Yes.
- [19:34] - That they believe in.
- Yes, agreed.
- [19:35] - All right, well thanks
so much for spending time.
- [19:38] This has been a fun conversation.
- [19:39] - It's been great.
- Excited to be hanging out
- [19:40] and see what the future brings.
- [19:42] - Indeed.
