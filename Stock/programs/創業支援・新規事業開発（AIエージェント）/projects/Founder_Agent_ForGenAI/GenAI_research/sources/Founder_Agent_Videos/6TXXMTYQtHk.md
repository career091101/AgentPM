- [00:00] At Notion, our mission is to help people
- [00:02] build beautiful tools for their life's
- [00:04] work. What AI has done is almost given
- [00:06] us a different gear, new electricity to
- [00:09] make it even simpler.
- [00:13] It's a really fun story. After co we
- [00:16] made our first companywide trip, [music]
- [00:18] my co-founders Ivan and Simon had just
- [00:20] gotten early access to GPD4. The two of
- [00:23] them essentially locked themselves in a
- [00:25] room to prototype a version of Notion
- [00:27] that taps into this GP4 API. By the end
- [00:30] of the week, they had a prototype that
- [00:31] was really compelling. Now they can
- [00:33] speak in their own language. We've gone
- [00:35] from people needing to learn software to
- [00:38] just speaking in English and seeing a
- [00:40] software emerge on the other side of
- [00:42] that. It felt like it's not just a
- [00:44] notion product, but it was our combined
- [00:46] product because it was really using
- [00:49] [music] OpenAI's APIs to launch that
- [00:51] >> from internal usage to GA. It's 50%
- [00:54] faster and that [music] speed actually
- [00:56] allows our users to use it reliably.
- [00:58] Ultimately, we do our work in a lot
- [01:00] [music] of places and utilizing notion
- [01:02] AI, we've worked really hard with OpenAI
- [01:04] to build lots of connectors and [music]
- [01:06] integrations. So today, your notion AI
- [01:09] isn't just connected to your notion
- [01:10] workspace, it's connected to GitHub,
- [01:12] [music] it's connected to Confluence,
- [01:14] it's connected to Slack. And so when you
- [01:16] ask a question, for instance, as an
- [01:18] engineering manager, I have everything
- [01:20] from who wrote the code, who [music] put
- [01:22] the design file in Figma to what is the
- [01:24] PD? and utilizing our embeddings from
- [01:26] OpenAI, we're able to make that
- [01:28] retrieval really fast and very high
- [01:30] quality. Unsurprisingly, [music]
- [01:32] when customers are using Notion AI,
- [01:34] they're almost twothirds as active on
- [01:36] notion than customers that don't. And
- [01:38] from that, [music] 3/4 of them say that
- [01:40] they they would never go back. That AI
- [01:42] is integral into how they use Notion.
- [01:44] [music]
- [01:44] >> I think maybe the most fun part about
- [01:46] this whole journey is that we are each
- [01:48] other's [music] customers. And so when
- [01:50] OpenAI tells us that our Q&A product is
- [01:53] really good, that gives us confidence
- [01:54] that we've built something that is truly
- [01:57] world class. Of [music] course, tapping
- [01:58] into the power that OpenAI has provided.
