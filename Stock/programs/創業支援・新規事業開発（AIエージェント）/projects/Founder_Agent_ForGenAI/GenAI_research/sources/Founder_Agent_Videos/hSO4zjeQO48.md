- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] uh less than two months are left for the
- [00:07] completion of 2025. Um this year has
- [00:10] been quite amazing. Uh we were able to
- [00:13] teach many many people out there. Uh
- [00:15] many people were able to make successful
- [00:17] career transition specifically in the
- [00:19] field of generative AI, agentic AI. Uh
- [00:21] many people have even started their own
- [00:23] startups. They're doing some amazing
- [00:25] work building specific agentic AI
- [00:28] applications. uh uh how do I count this
- [00:31] year as a successful because I feel that
- [00:33] how much values we are able to add in
- [00:36] others life right and uh through our
- [00:38] courses through our Udemy courses
- [00:41] through the things that we do in our
- [00:42] YouTube channel uh we were able to see
- [00:45] that specific growth right uh in this
- [00:48] specific video I really want to talk
- [00:50] about one amazing course announcement
- [00:53] and this is probably the last course for
- [00:56] this entire year uh this is the last
- [00:58] course because anything that will be
- [01:00] coming will be coming after January
- [01:02] month the next uh next year January
- [01:05] right so uh that was related to this
- [01:08] specific announcements uh so I know some
- [01:10] people will not be interested to hear
- [01:12] about courses and all if you're not
- [01:14] interested please go ahead close this
- [01:17] video down you can go ahead and watch
- [01:18] all my YouTube videos I have been
- [01:20] continuously uploading over there but if
- [01:23] you are really interested in
- [01:24] understanding what this specific batch
- [01:27] is all about This is the Agentic AI 3.0
- [01:31] and I really want to name this batch as
- [01:33] ultimate rag boot camp wherein we will
- [01:35] build traditional to agentic systems
- [01:38] with cloud deployment. So this is the
- [01:40] course that we are specifically coming
- [01:42] up with. Uh initially I had decided this
- [01:45] course date to October 26th. Okay. But
- [01:49] we are going to change this particular
- [01:51] course date you know. So if I just go
- [01:53] ahead and reload it, uh this course date
- [01:55] will get changed to November 2, 2025.
- [01:59] The reason why extending it to one more
- [02:02] week because October 26th that will
- [02:04] still be the festive season wherein we
- [02:07] have the power. So I really want to
- [02:09] people to enjoy that specific uh uh
- [02:13] period of time you know the entire one
- [02:15] week uh enjoy that time you know
- [02:17] somewhere around uh if you see with
- [02:19] respect to the calendar everybody will
- [02:21] be busy uh from 18th 19 20 21 22 23 so I
- [02:26] don't want to probably disturb this
- [02:28] specific week you know so I definitely
- [02:30] want you all to enjoy the poly with your
- [02:32] family and all and uh from the first
- [02:35] week of November that is on Sunday we
- [02:37] will be starting ing this particular
- [02:39] batch you know uh the main aim over here
- [02:42] is to talk about how to build agentic
- [02:44] rags system also talk about generative
- [02:47] agentic AI in the specific batch itself
- [02:50] um the reason why I'm making this
- [02:52] particular batch it is very simple
- [02:54] because nowadays every companies are
- [02:56] focusing on building agentic AI system
- [02:58] itself right um and uh when we talk
- [03:01] about application wise rag is one of the
- [03:04] most important use cases that
- [03:05] everybody's building Okay. Now, uh in
- [03:08] this particular batch, as I said, the
- [03:10] start date is November 2, 2025. Uh
- [03:13] timing will be Saturday and Sunday,
- [03:15] every Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 a.m.
- [03:17] ISTT to 12:00 p.m. 12:00 p.m. IST. 12
- [03:20] p.m. basically means uh after this 12
- [03:23] itself, you know. Uh so 3 hours of
- [03:25] class. It will also include doubt
- [03:27] clearing session. If doubt clearing
- [03:29] session gets extended, we may extend
- [03:31] this class till 1 p.m. Okay. Here we are
- [03:33] going to build scalable and intelligent
- [03:35] rag applications. Foundation of rag
- [03:37] these all things are there. These all
- [03:39] things we'll be learning right we'll be
- [03:41] learning foundation of l ra ra ra ra ra
- [03:42] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
- [03:42] ra rag, lang chain, llama index, hast
- [03:44] tag, document parsing, lang graph, work
- [03:47] workflow orchestration, enhanced rag
- [03:49] techniques, multistructure and structure
- [03:50] rag, multimodel and structure rag,
- [03:52] conversational and contextual rag,
- [03:54] agentic rag, cutting edge innovation,
- [03:56] model context protocol, production and
- [03:58] deployment and portfolio project. So we
- [04:00] will be discussing about all the
- [04:02] specific stuff. Okay. Now uh over here
- [04:05] uh my entire team with respect to the
- [04:07] mentors are this four main mentors that
- [04:10] is Sunonny Savvita Mang Paul and myself.
- [04:14] So either one of them will be coming and
- [04:16] taking specific modules. We may be
- [04:18] distributing between us. Whoever will be
- [04:21] available with respect to this we will
- [04:23] be taking up the session. Okay. So that
- [04:25] is one very important announcement and
- [04:27] till now the amazing feedback that we
- [04:29] have got out of five we have an average
- [04:32] feedback of 4.7 right so which is really
- [04:34] really tremendously amazing you know
- [04:37] from all the students that we have got
