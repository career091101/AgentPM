- [00:00] Uh coming up right now we have a
- [00:02] fireside chat with Olivier from OpenAI
- [00:04] and our own Carl from Venturebe. They're
- [00:07] going to take us inside OpenAI's agent
- [00:09] stack. All right. Thanks everybody for
- [00:12] sticking with us to the end of the
- [00:14] conference. Um and everybody who's
- [00:16] watching now live or uh later. Uh so I'm
- [00:20] very pleased to have Olivia here. This
- [00:22] is uh our second time doing this I
- [00:25] believe. And also um feels like more of
- [00:27] a maybe third honest I definitely my
- [00:30] third transform and so we're happy to
- [00:32] have you again and um you know a lot has
- [00:35] a lot has changed every year with with
- [00:36] open AI over the years and so uh let's
- [00:39] let's start with uh some of the uh
- [00:41] exciting milestones you guys today just
- [00:43] were announcing that it's been five year
- [00:46] API launched and um you know I I think
- [00:50] there were some statistics that you guys
- [00:51] put out but I'd love to hear in your
- [00:52] words you know what what uh milestones
- [00:55] stand out to you from you know 5 years
- [00:57] to now. Yeah, it's been it's been five
- [00:59] years um five years since we launched
- [01:03] essentially DT3
- [01:05] easily accessible through the API and
- [01:07] man like you know the past five years
- [01:09] has been uh pretty wild. Um the growth
- [01:12] like in the past year has been pretty
- [01:14] insane like we track like uh usage
- [01:17] through um you know a few different
- [01:18] metrics. Um, we do get like developers
- [01:21] like you know how many like businesses,
- [01:22] startup developers like use our models
- [01:25] and APIs. I think we just reached like a
- [01:28] million monthly active developers like
- [01:30] building like applications like on
- [01:32] OpenAI. Wow, that's great. Yeah, that's
- [01:35] been pretty insane. We track like as
- [01:37] well like you know tokens like volume
- [01:39] like you know how many um tokens like
- [01:41] words are being generated through the
- [01:43] API. I think oh man that number is so
- [01:46] big like we I lost track. I think it's
- [01:47] something like $600 trillion tokens like
- [01:50] this year like you know numbers like too
- [01:53] many zeros essentially for me to even
- [01:54] like internalize what does that mean?
- [01:56] Yeah. But yeah, it's been super
- [01:57] exciting. Uh and you know I think
- [02:00] another really big story this year has
- [02:03] been
- [02:05] losing. Okay, there we go. The another
- [02:07] big story this year has been the launch
- [02:09] of the responses API and agents SDK. I
- [02:11] think we we covered this when it first
- [02:13] came out. Was that April I believe or uh
- [02:15] and so you know what what what what was
- [02:17] the thinking behind launching this? you
- [02:19] know this is the newest kind of
- [02:20] development plat you're head of platform
- [02:23] you know this is the newest and greatest
- [02:25] latest and greatest that people can use
- [02:27] to build stuff on your platform why
- [02:29] launch these things what can they do
- [02:31] differently and why why launch them now
- [02:34] yeah that's a that's a good question um
- [02:37] I think if you zoom out AI use cases are
- [02:41] moving from simple Q&A chatbot to
- [02:45] actually use cases where the application
- [02:48] the agent can do stuff for you. It can
- [02:50] perform actions. Um, and so we thought
- [02:53] it was the right time to essentially
- [02:55] refresh our product offering on the API
- [02:58] in order to enable that uh transition.
- [03:00] And so we shipped um back in May, I
- [03:03] think uh the responses API in the agent
- [03:05] SDK which are basically meant uh for
- [03:07] businesses to make it much easier to
- [03:10] build applications that can call other
- [03:12] tools that can um reason before they
- [03:16] respond. And so yeah, we thought it was
- [03:18] a good like you know milestone with the
- [03:19] reasoning models to take like a new like
- [03:22] bolder actionoriented uh approach. Yeah.
- [03:25] And so those obviously those reasoning
- [03:27] models set the stage you know now we
- [03:29] have a number of them 03 04 mini 04 high
- [03:33] um tell me tell me about you know
- [03:35] obviously we've seen this whole
- [03:36] conference we've been talking to people
- [03:38] with uh interest in using agents in
- [03:41] interest in having agents uh go off and
- [03:44] do tasks for them uh in the enterprise.
- [03:46] So you know from your perspective you
- [03:48] guys are seeing a lot of developers
- [03:50] using your platform to do this very
- [03:52] thing. So when when should an enterprise
- [03:54] be looking to do like just one agent
- [03:56] versus like you know maybe trying to do
- [03:58] multiple a fleet of agents like a sing
- [04:00] we're talking about like a single agent
- [04:02] loop. Can you even define that and and
- [04:04] how that differs from uh you know multi-
- [04:06] aent system or a sub agent even like
- [04:08] just give us the lay of the land I guess
- [04:10] in your opinion. Yeah. Um
- [04:13] I think like in the limit I expect that
- [04:17] every consumer, every individual, every
- [04:20] business will have like its own agent.
- [04:22] So a single agent which basically has
- [04:24] you know as much context as it needs as
- [04:26] access to like many different tools. Um
- [04:30] so you know a single agent the the
- [04:33] concrete like challenges that we have at
- [04:34] the moment the practical challenges is
- [04:36] that building accurate and reliable
- [04:39] single agent is hard. like it's really
- [04:41] hard. Uh and it gets like more and more
- [04:44] challenging like when you add like a lot
- [04:45] of context, a lot of tools essentially
- [04:47] to the agent. And so a practice which
- [04:49] has emerged in the past couple of years
- [04:51] is to essentially break down the agents
- [04:53] into multiple sub agents, right? and um
- [04:57] allow essentially one agent to have like
- [05:00] as you know you would do essentially
- [05:02] separation of concerns like you know in
- [05:03] software in general uh and to have like
- [05:05] you know sub agent communicate to each
- [05:07] other by handing off um like uh tasks
- [05:10] and so um I think the reality of like
- [05:13] the the landscape that we see at the
- [05:15] moment is that we see more and more use
- [05:16] cases like working with single agent but
- [05:18] as soon as you want to have like a
- [05:20] relatively complex workflows with like
- [05:22] many different scenarios like a lot of
- [05:24] instructions a lot potential tools um
- [05:27] that needs to be actioned. it's often uh
- [05:30] recommended to break it down with like
- [05:32] multiple sub aent for questions of
- [05:34] reliability and accuracy and and and in
- [05:36] those cases uh the sub agents are they
- [05:40] are they basically responding to and
- [05:41] taking instructions from
- [05:44] an orchestrator agent or or who how are
- [05:46] they all staying organized I guess in in
- [05:48] in the ideal use cases that you're
- [05:50] seeing it's like a small team it's like
- [05:52] a small team like it's it's cute like
- [05:53] you know they have multiple roles
- [05:54] essentially like usually you have like a
- [05:56] triage agent whose only job essentially
- [05:59] is to sort of classify the intent of the
- [06:00] query. Give you an example. Um let's say
- [06:04] we're doing like you know customer
- [06:05] support automation. You know you're like
- [06:07] a big like e-commerce brand. You want to
- [06:09] automate like customer support tickets
- [06:11] like like the sort of the the spectrum
- [06:13] like of questions that a customer may
- [06:15] ask is extremely broad. So first you
- [06:17] have a triage agent job only like to
- [06:20] specify like classify the intent and
- [06:22] then that agent is going to essentially
- [06:24] hand over to like a tier one agent for
- [06:26] like simple questions you know. um where
- [06:29] is my order like you know it's been two
- [06:30] days it's been delayed sometime you know
- [06:32] question is simple and so that agent can
- [06:33] just that tier one agent can take it
- [06:35] over um if that answer is the question
- [06:38] is actually complex like you know hey um
- [06:41] I was expecting a refund it's still not
- [06:43] here that agent is going to escalate to
- [06:45] another agent and so
- [06:48] that's like what we call like a more of
- [06:50] a sequential essentially um architecture
- [06:52] for agents and in some cases you have
- [06:55] indeed like a master agent that
- [06:56] basically hands over like um request to
- [06:59] sub agents who then essentially um
- [07:02] return like the result back to it and
- [07:04] then answers like the customer. And this
- [07:06] is all you guys have already published a
- [07:08] number of documents and um examples even
- [07:11] and and open sourced frameworks of how
- [07:14] to use some of these agents even prior
- [07:16] to this conference this I remember
- [07:18] writing last week or the week before you
- [07:20] guys open sourced a customer service
- [07:22] agent framework and so that's available
- [07:24] on hugging face but but again you can
- [07:25] you can go and build these types of
- [07:27] agents directly in the agents SDK and
- [07:30] you can use different models right this
- [07:32] to again this was something that we
- [07:34] reported on when it first came out But
- [07:36] you're not restricting people to only
- [07:37] the open AI model. So they can actually
- [07:39] build a uh use your frameworks and go
- [07:41] and build it with a different model and
- [07:43] use your platform. Yeah, exactly. you
- [07:44] know in some cases like it will make
- [07:46] sense like to use other models if you
- [07:47] have like very specific needs or you
- [07:49] know you want to have I don't know on
- [07:51] premise ondevice like model like we
- [07:54] don't want to constrain you and so we
- [07:56] open source that agent SDK to as you
- [07:58] know an orchestration framework to make
- [07:59] it easy to combine um essentially the
- [08:02] the best of breed uh models um and we've
- [08:05] seen like pretty cool adoption uh in the
- [08:08] past few months um you know companies
- [08:10] like box um the the cloud uh document uh
- [08:14] platform
- [08:15] have been like you know uh pushing quite
- [08:17] a bit uh knowledge assistance because
- [08:19] you know we're all like pretty
- [08:21] overwhelmed by documents and files like
- [08:23] on daily basis you know uh it's even
- [08:26] larger you know when you're like in a
- [08:27] relatively large company and so it's
- [08:29] clear that you know those agents are
- [08:30] much I mean excel at um parsing like a
- [08:34] lot of information and understanding
- [08:35] exactly what is the most relevant to you
- [08:38] so box has been really cool another
- [08:40] example which I like quite a bit is uh
- [08:41] stripe uh the fintech you used to work
- [08:44] there. Yes, I used to work there. Uh I
- [08:46] used to work there, but they have a
- [08:47] pretty cool um use case here as well. um
- [08:51] businesses who need to manage like their
- [08:54] finances, their payments, their incoming
- [08:56] orders. Like similarly like you know
- [08:58] there is quite a bit of like noise
- [08:59] information and models are pretty good
- [09:01] at um summarizing distilling that
- [09:04] information and offering you like you
- [09:06] know one or two like very relevant
- [09:08] specific actions and and are they those
- [09:10] those examples are all agent based as
- [09:12] well using the agents SDK. Yeah,
- [09:14] exactly. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. And so let
- [09:16] me talk about a little bit about the
- [09:18] responses API. Let's transition to that.
- [09:20] So that's you know the agents SDK allows
- [09:22] you to build agents on OpenAI's platform
- [09:25] but you can include any you can build an
- [09:27] agent powered by totally open source
- [09:30] models nonopen AI models awesome uh
- [09:32] capability. Responses API is a little
- [09:34] bit different. Can you tell us a little
- [09:36] bit about what the responses API offers
- [09:38] and specifically with regards to uh
- [09:40] tracing and evaluation frameworks, you
- [09:42] know, that that make these agents that
- [09:44] people are building kind of more
- [09:46] observable or um uh uh you know, op that
- [09:49] you can optimize their performance.
- [09:53] Yeah. So, um it's still very very early
- [09:58] days like in AI software development.
- [10:00] Um, and if you step back like the the
- [10:03] usual like history of software is a a
- [10:06] history of like layers of abstraction
- [10:09] like you first have access to like a
- [10:10] very low level, very technical, very
- [10:13] abstract um um primitives you know uh
- [10:17] you started with like
- [10:20] machine language or I don't know C
- [10:22] essentially and over time like you know
- [10:23] the industry has been like building like
- [10:25] more and more like layers abraction on
- [10:27] top and so the way I think about the
- [10:29] response API is like you know It's
- [10:30] probably the biggest like new layer of
- [10:32] section that we introduced since pretty
- [10:35] much like GPT3 API like 5 years ago. So
- [10:38] until the responsive API the businesses
- [10:41] developers had essentially to um
- [10:44] orchestrate like to interact themsel
- [10:47] with every single model for pass. So
- [10:50] they had essentially to say hey you know
- [10:51] I want to build an agent like that agent
- [10:53] has like five different like you know
- [10:55] normal interactions. I'm going to
- [10:56] configure every single one of them. um
- [10:59] you know in details. Um the responses
- [11:02] API essentially abstracts that and you
- [11:05] know it essentially allows like the
- [11:07] developer to focus more like on the
- [11:08] intent of the query like hey you know if
- [11:11] my intent is to um um do a web search
- [11:14] for instance like you know with an LLM
- [11:17] like that web search like may use one or
- [11:20] many like model passes essentially but
- [11:23] you know as a developer like I don't
- [11:25] really care about that you know I care
- [11:27] about essentially like returning like a
- [11:28] really good response to the customer and
- [11:30] so the responses API essentially handles
- [11:33] that um that loop. Um the second thing
- [11:35] which is really good with resp
- [11:42] tools um pretty common tools like you
- [11:44] know the ability to like do web search
- [11:47] like for fresh data the ability to do
- [11:49] like knowledge retrieval like on some
- [11:51] custom files that you would have and a
- [11:53] few others like you know the ability to
- [11:54] connect to like MCP servers. So
- [11:57] essentially what we're doing here is
- [11:58] that we are making it easier to um build
- [12:01] um applications that combine models with
- [12:05] tools. Got it. And so so ideally and and
- [12:09] I think a number of uh places reported
- [12:11] on this but ideally somebody would come
- [12:13] use the agents SDK to build an agent but
- [12:16] then also use the responses API to to as
- [12:19] the way that by which that agent can
- [12:22] call a search call um uh you know like
- [12:25] you said the document grounding let's
- [12:27] say from a from a proprietary uh
- [12:30] enterprises data or documents something
- [12:32] like this. That's right. That could be
- [12:33] that could be a a very valid
- [12:35] architecture. Yeah. and and and and and
- [12:37] when we talk about like this kind of
- [12:39] quest that uh enterprises often come to
- [12:41] us with with observability, of course,
- [12:43] there's a number of solutions out there,
- [12:45] there's a number of um third-party
- [12:47] add-ons that people are are are looking
- [12:49] to, but you know, do you guys have any
- [12:52] like tools that are doing, you know,
- [12:54] either this like policy based refusal,
- [12:57] SOC2 logging, like this kind of idea of
- [13:00] like yes, it's awesome to let our agents
- [13:02] go tackle these tasks, but we also want
- [13:04] to see some sort of record of how they
- [13:06] went about this or something like this.
- [13:08] Yeah, my my uh hot take is that um model
- [13:12] evaluation is probably the biggest
- [13:14] bottleneck uh to have like massive AI
- [13:17] adoption.
- [13:18] You know I would better models help of
- [13:21] course like you know they will unlock
- [13:22] more use cases but when I talk to
- [13:24] businesses to enterprises like the
- [13:26] biggest issue they have is not so much
- [13:27] that the model is too dump or not
- [13:29] capable enough is that they cannot get
- [13:31] quite the model to behave like exactly
- [13:33] like they want like 99.9% of the time
- [13:36] and so easy to do a demo that behaves
- [13:38] well like 90% of the time but then like
- [13:40] you know getting to like two nines three
- [13:42] nines like much harder and the reality
- [13:44] is that unless you invest in evaluation
- [13:47] what we Evals, it's really hard
- [13:50] essentially to build that trust, that
- [13:51] confidence that the model is being
- [13:52] accurate, reliable. And so we've
- [13:54] invested quite a bit um over the past
- [13:56] year in what we call like evaluation and
- [13:58] tracing, which are essentially tools
- [14:00] like to define like what good looks like
- [14:03] and then to hill climb essentially to
- [14:05] tune the model in order to get from you
- [14:07] know 90 95 99 39s um of reliability. And
- [14:12] and and are those are those um kind of
- [14:14] examples or the uh you know guiding the
- [14:17] model with these like the behaviors that
- [14:19] you want to see those come from you or
- [14:22] from the businesses that you're working
- [14:23] with or a combination of both or who
- [14:25] who's who's creating those um that
- [14:28] guidance for the models to follow so
- [14:30] they can get to that level of of
- [14:32] accuracy. It usually comes from the
- [14:34] business but we provide support on how
- [14:36] do you express essentially well uh what
- [14:39] good looks like and something which is
- [14:41] really interesting as well is you know
- [14:43] we we're talking about customer support
- [14:45] um the knowledge in an enterprise and
- [14:48] customer support like hey you know if
- [14:50] that scenario happens like what exactly
- [14:51] should I do does not lie with engineers
- [14:55] right like software engineers like don't
- [14:57] really know very good point you know
- [14:59] they lie with like the actual the agents
- [15:01] like the the operation team like the ops
- [15:03] essentially teams. Uh and so there's an
- [15:05] interesting challenge here of you know
- [15:07] making tools which are going to be
- [15:09] mostly used by like subject matter
- [15:10] expert who may not be technical from a
- [15:13] software engineering point of view. Um
- [15:15] and so I think whoever like cracks I
- [15:18] would say that um that challenge will
- [15:20] probably unlock a lot of enterprise
- [15:22] adoption. Yeah. Yeah. That's a huge gap
- [15:24] that uh you know can be crossed and
- [15:26] obviously these tools help to to start
- [15:28] to do that. But let let me you know we
- [15:30] talked a little bit about Stripe and and
- [15:31] and Box. I mean we talked about customer
- [15:33] service agents. Are are customer service
- [15:35] agents the ones that that tend to people
- [15:37] tend to see the most value from
- [15:39] initially or or what are some of the
- [15:40] authentic excuse me a agentic
- [15:43] automations that tend to you know yield
- [15:46] value and and that customers uh you know
- [15:49] enterprises see as uh being worthwhile.
- [15:52] Yeah it's a good question. Um there are
- [15:55] quite a few uh customer support comes up
- [15:57] quite a bit like automating like you
- [15:59] know customer support request with text
- [16:01] of course like email and more and more
- [16:03] by voice. Um voice is being so expensive
- [16:06] but like for many consumer businesses
- [16:08] like that's the primary way for people
- [16:10] to get help essentially. So that's been
- [16:12] a big one. A second big one has been um
- [16:16] providing like knowledge assistance for
- [16:17] like technical knowledge like you're a
- [16:20] car manufacturer, you are I don't know
- [16:22] any sort of technical device and you
- [16:24] have like you know thousands of like
- [16:25] pages of like technical specs and so you
- [16:28] know having an agent like allows you to
- [16:30] digest that information. Um a last use
- [16:34] case which has been huge and growing
- [16:35] pretty fast is the whole topic of like
- [16:37] um automating software engineering. Oh
- [16:41] yeah, of course. And we've had a number
- [16:42] of conversations with different people
- [16:44] who are uh seeking to do that.
- [16:45] Obviously, you guys just launched Codeex
- [16:47] and that's a huge uh uh you know tool
- [16:50] and and um uh ability that that you've
- [16:53] given to people to do this. So um uh let
- [16:55] me ask as well um uh you know speaking
- [16:58] of this like idea between the gap
- [17:01] between the subject matter experts who
- [17:03] want an agent to go out take care of
- [17:04] some work for them and then the
- [17:05] engineers who have to build this. What
- [17:07] kind of team do you think the
- [17:10] enterprises that you've seen be
- [17:11] successful, what kind of team do they
- [17:13] have in place to launch agents that uh
- [17:15] do make it into production and do make a
- [17:17] change? Is it is it is there a standard
- [17:20] like setup that people are following
- [17:23] that that leads to success or is it does
- [17:25] it vary wide wild wildly depending on
- [17:27] the you know the sector or the industry?
- [17:32] If I pattern match
- [17:34] usually like in enterprises
- [17:37] there is a small fraction of very high
- [17:40] agency people who whenever they see a
- [17:42] problem and when they see a technology
- [17:44] they run at it like whatever their roles
- [17:47] or you know their their function like
- [17:48] they could be engineers they could be
- [17:50] like you know ops or something else but
- [17:52] they see like an opportunity and their
- [17:54] first reaction is like okay how can I
- [17:55] make it work those are usually the
- [17:57] people like who push like you know first
- [17:59] for like chatbt adoption the enterprise
- [18:01] we start to understand like okay that
- [18:03] thing can like understand that your
- [18:04] language can understand English like you
- [18:06] know where else like could we use
- [18:07] English um as a programming language um
- [18:10] and so I haven't found like a good word
- [18:13] like you know for that sort of that that
- [18:15] persona it's not like um a specific job
- [18:17] or like you know function but yeah
- [18:20] people who connect the dots essentially
- [18:22] and are relentless like you know like
- [18:25] first try the thing is not working
- [18:26] exactly as they expected that's fine
- [18:28] they'll try over and over again yeah
- [18:30] yeah that's a great point and That's
- [18:31] something that we've has come up a lot
- [18:32] in this conference and even in our
- [18:34] roundts is like those who tend to see
- [18:36] success with AI are the ones that spend
- [18:38] time with it and are willing to let it
- [18:40] fail and and learn from the failures.
- [18:42] Exactly. Exactly. I've seen many use
- [18:44] cases of you know where people like you
- [18:46] know love JBT then try to automate like
- [18:48] some stuff with you know like um our
- [18:50] APIs it's not working. they get stuck
- [18:52] and their first reaction is like, "Oh my
- [18:54] gosh, like the technology is not ready
- [18:55] yet essentially, which is sometime the
- [18:58] case, you know, but most of the time not
- [18:59] the case." Like the MOS are pretty
- [19:01] smart. Like I mean, I don't know,
- [19:02] they're much smarter than me. Uh any any
- [19:05] one of us, right? And I think to your
- [19:07] point, it's like maybe the, you know,
- [19:09] the approach that people need to take is
- [19:10] that like AI curious, AI flexible, like
- [19:13] I need to be able to like try to ask my
- [19:15] questions in a different way or solve
- [19:17] this problem still using an AI, but go
- [19:19] about it a little bit differently, you
- [19:21] And so I think that's absolutely a
- [19:22] lesson that uh everyone here can can
- [19:24] take away. Um so I I do want to I know
- [19:27] we're right at time here. Um I do want
- [19:29] to just finish off with any last
- [19:31] thoughts, anything that to guide people
- [19:33] in the future. Obviously exciting stuff
- [19:35] planned. I'm sure we've all heard about
- [19:37] the open source uh open AI model that's
- [19:40] in the work. Anything else you want to
- [19:41] tease up or say for the audience?
- [19:44] Um,
- [19:48] I think
- [19:50] the most underhyped
- [19:53] thing at the moment is probably still
- [19:55] reasoning models. I think we are still
- [19:58] scratching the surface on what reasoning
- [20:00] models can do. So reasoning models are
- [20:01] 0103 models that can think before they
- [20:04] respond. You know, just like a human
- [20:06] being, type two thinking, if you will.
- [20:08] Um I still have conviction that we are
- [20:11] pretty much at the DT2 or DPT3 level of
- [20:14] maturity of those models and once we
- [20:16] have models you can think like you know
- [20:18] not only for a few seconds but for
- [20:19] minutes for hours you give it like you
- [20:22] know a task like you know late at night
- [20:24] you come back in the morning the thing
- [20:26] is like solve like you know incredibly
- [20:27] hard problem like you know um explore
- [20:30] like the web like twice like three times
- [20:33] like I think that's going to enable some
- [20:34] pretty mind-blowing use cases and and
- [20:36] already you can try a preview of this
- [20:38] with 03 Pro, right? I mean, that one
- [20:40] thinks for a while, so already there's
- [20:43] Yeah, there's some uh opportunity to get
- [20:45] a taste of that. Well, thank you again
- [20:46] for this. I know we're uh we're already
- [20:48] past time. It's It's yelling at me to
- [20:50] please wrap up. So, thank you so much.
- [20:51] We could keep doing this forever, but uh
- [20:53] thank you. All right. Thank you.
