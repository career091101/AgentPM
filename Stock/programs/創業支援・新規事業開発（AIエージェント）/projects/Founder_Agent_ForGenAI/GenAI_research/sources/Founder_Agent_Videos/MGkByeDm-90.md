- [00:03] if you building AI products probably a
- [00:06] great amount of time is actually not
- [00:07] programming but literally staring at the
- [00:09] screen and waiting for lar model to
- [00:11] finish off task and pray to lar model
- [00:14] God that everything goes well but quite
- [00:16] often it doesn't there are millions of
- [00:18] different cases where your large range
- [00:19] Modo system just didn't work or say
- [00:21] something stupid and this problem
- [00:23] becomes bigger and bigger in later stage
- [00:25] after the large L Modo system goes into
- [00:27] production majority of my time actually
- [00:29] starts spending on evaluating monitoring
- [00:31] testing because real world cases are
- [00:33] really Dynamic and unpredictable quite
- [00:36] often when we build a system there are
- [00:37] few task case in our mind that we are
- [00:39] building towards but once it goes into
- [00:41] wild customer will tell all sorts of
- [00:43] different requests different ways like I
- [00:45] was building a meeting scheduler agent
- [00:47] where I was expecting requests where
- [00:49] people say things like let's meet
- [00:50] tomorrow 9:00 p.m. s time but in reality
- [00:53] the case would be much more complicated
- [00:55] where people would say I'm basing UK but
- [00:57] travel to Singapore next week and B
- [00:59] China the week after once your L modor
- [01:01] system actually put into your customer's
- [01:03] hand it is almost guaranteed to break or
- [01:05] perform really weirdly in certain cases
- [01:08] and this is when you want to start
- [01:09] iterating the system and iteration of
- [01:11] large range Modo system is extremely
- [01:13] timec consuming because there are lots
- [01:15] of different combination of things cuz
- [01:16] large L model is not deterministic which
- [01:18] means the result will be slightly
- [01:20] different every time and there are all
- [01:21] sorts different combination of different
- [01:23] settings like the prop itself the model
- [01:26] you're using the temperature and how you
- [01:28] break down the flow if you're building a
- [01:29] agent do you use function calling agent
- [01:31] or use react framework and most of the
- [01:33] time your large L model system is not
- [01:35] just one large Lage model call but a
- [01:37] flow of different lar model steps or
- [01:39] agent who can autonomously decide what
- [01:41] to do next with different tools so the
- [01:43] biggest challenge is when you change one
- [01:45] thing you don't really have a good
- [01:46] confidence that it is actually going to
- [01:48] improve the system for all the cases
- [01:50] like you might put a special PR as
- [01:51] banded solution to solve a specific edge
- [01:54] cases that you just capture but this
- [01:56] prpt might actually make large Range
- [01:57] model pay too much attention to this
- [01:59] spefic spefic part of task but start
- [02:01] ignoring some other parts of prompt so
- [02:03] to gain real confidence you do want to
- [02:04] test system in many different type of
- [02:06] cases and that's why live L model system
- [02:08] evaluation is such a big topic it
- [02:10] basically means how can you build a
- [02:11] system to evaluate the performance of a
- [02:14] large L mode system against the certain
- [02:16] tasks so that you will have a benchmark
- [02:18] to know if your new version actually
- [02:20] improved and most importantly help you
- [02:22] find the optimal combination of all the
- [02:23] different settings and system design for
- [02:26] the specific task that you try to
- [02:27] complete and there are huge amount of
- [02:29] public EV valuation or on the Internet
- [02:31] which is useful in some way where it
- [02:32] give you a overall idea about which
- [02:34] model is probably the best in certain
- [02:36] type of General task but quite often it
- [02:38] is not that useful because the task they
- [02:41] test is not exactly the task you want so
- [02:43] most time I can't really trust the
- [02:44] result from those public evaluation that
- [02:47] people are sharing because I know almost
- [02:48] certain when I test different models
- [02:50] with my own system the rank will be
- [02:52] totally different that's why it's
- [02:53] important to actually build your own
- [02:55] custom evaluation process most rful one
- [02:58] that everyone is doing is is human
- [03:00] evaluation which means you basically
- [03:01] look at a log of the large Range model
- [03:03] system output and just eyeball the
- [03:05] result to see whether it is good or not
- [03:07] and if you are a bit more sophisticated
- [03:09] you probably will set up some logging
- [03:10] system like Les miss or phix to have
- [03:12] better interface to log and review every
- [03:14] single step in those SL Range model
- [03:16] system in most of cases human evaluation
- [03:18] is still the must have and best thing to
- [03:20] do especially while you're building the
- [03:22] system but the problem is once your
- [03:23] system goes into production the volume
- [03:25] of different cases to Monitor and
- [03:27] evaluate is so big so it's almost
- [03:30] impossible for you to do human
- [03:31] evaluation on every single case anymore
- [03:34] otherwise either you or the system going
- [03:35] to break that's why the concept of use
- [03:37] large Lage model as evalu interesting
- [03:40] and important and the idea here is
- [03:42] pretty simple instead of getting human
- [03:44] ibing the result to decide if the system
- [03:46] is delivering good result or not we can
- [03:48] build a large L model evaluate complete
- [03:50] same evaluation task so that it can
- [03:52] handle huge amount of volume and scale
- [03:54] very well and sometimes the evaluator
- [03:56] can not only be just large Range model
- [03:59] can also be code to write down some hard
- [04:01] code rules and do heric evaluation like
- [04:03] if the code generated has Arrow or if
- [04:05] the answer or exactly match Mass formul
- [04:08] so such a automated evaluation system is
- [04:10] critical to launch any production level
- [04:12] lar Lang model system but it is not
- [04:14] always clear how to build such system
- [04:16] especially how can you build such large
- [04:18] L model evaluator that almost as good as
- [04:21] human to decide if a system is
- [04:22] performing well or not that's why today
- [04:24] I want to share a bit about how can you
- [04:26] build such a large L model evaluation
- [04:28] system so you can really speed up the
- [04:30] creation speed and increase the level of
- [04:32] confidence for both you and your
- [04:34] customers but before we dive into this I
- [04:36] know many of you are going through a
- [04:38] career change or looking at starting
- [04:40] your own AI career but have you ever
- [04:42] thought about how to leverage AI to land
- [04:44] on your next dream job so hopspot did a
- [04:46] research about how the new generation of
- [04:49] job Seeker are utilizing different AI
- [04:50] tools or platforms to streamline their
- [04:52] workflow and to be much more effective
- [04:54] add job hunting process and they share a
- [04:56] collection of all sorts of different AI
- [04:58] platforms and St UPS in this job hunting
- [05:01] Market from how to script and collect
- [05:03] all the job information using AI to find
- [05:05] ones that suit you the best to craft a
- [05:08] standout application that catch the eyes
- [05:10] of recruiter and hiring manager using AI
- [05:12] as well as simulating the interview
- [05:14] process with AI so people can feel
- [05:16] confident even before jumping on the
- [05:17] actual interview to even salary
- [05:19] estimation to get a good understanding
- [05:21] of how much it actually works so this
- [05:23] was quite a refresh for me to understand
- [05:25] two things one is all the possible ways
- [05:27] that you can already utilize AI to help
- [05:29] you land on next dream job and second it
- [05:31] is also a good way for me to understand
- [05:33] what does AI stack look like for the job
- [05:35] market which definitely inspired me a
- [05:37] few different business idea that we can
- [05:38] potentially build help job Seekers so I
- [05:40] definitely recommend you to download
- [05:42] this free report about how people are
- [05:44] land on dream job using AI you can click
- [05:46] on the link in the description below to
- [05:48] download this report for free now let's
- [05:50] back to how do you build a evaluation
- [05:52] system so there are few steps you will
- [05:54] need to choose a metrix that is most
- [05:56] important to your system and then you'll
- [05:58] build a valuator that that can actually
- [06:00] provide evaluation result based on this
- [06:02] metrics and thir is optional but really
- [06:04] important you will also want to prepare
- [06:06] a golden data set that you can use to
- [06:08] really test and recalibrate your
- [06:10] evaluator to making sure it can deliver
- [06:12] the human level performance and after
- [06:14] that you can start testing different
- [06:16] system variations and compare the
- [06:18] performance so firstly choose the right
- [06:21] metrix for your larange model system
- [06:23] this is the first and most important
- [06:24] step so you want to choose a metrix that
- [06:26] you really care and most time the way I
- [06:28] look at it is after doing some eyeball
- [06:30] testing I start getting sense about
- [06:32] which part of system can often break
- [06:34] those are normally the ones that want to
- [06:35] design some kind of metrics around it to
- [06:37] be able to get a benchmark and evaluate
- [06:39] against for example if you're building a
- [06:41] rack system two parts you probably care
- [06:43] the most one is a retrieval whether your
- [06:45] system actually retriev the relevant
- [06:48] knowledge base at first place and second
- [06:50] is Generation does a large damage model
- [06:52] actually generate a result based on the
- [06:54] information provided or did actually
- [06:56] hallucinate and if those two are most
- [06:58] important things then you can design
- [07:00] some metrics around those two things so
- [07:01] you probably have metrics of contextual
- [07:03] relevance where input will be the user
- [07:05] quray as well as a retriev documents so
- [07:08] that we can decide is the retrieve
- [07:09] knowledge actually relevant to the
- [07:11] question second part will be
- [07:12] faithfulness to test is a gener answer
- [07:15] actually granted by the data that it
- [07:17] retrieve or did they actually
- [07:18] hallucinate different system can have
- [07:20] really different metrics for example if
- [07:22] you are building a customer support
- [07:24] chatbot where even though the majority
- [07:25] of system are very similar to a rack
- [07:27] system but you probably in this case
- [07:29] also care about the realtime ux cuz you
- [07:32] can almost always adding more kind of
- [07:34] steps in the flow to improve the
- [07:35] retrieval relevancy as well as
- [07:37] generation quality but you actually
- [07:39] don't want to sacrifice the user
- [07:40] experience and getting user just waiting
- [07:42] for a long time then you probably put a
- [07:43] latency metrix as well which is how long
- [07:46] does the whole system to generate result
- [07:48] for the cury if I'm building a research
- [07:50] agent I probably care about couple
- [07:52] things one is this agent able to do as
- [07:54] much of research possible to gather all
- [07:57] the information relevant and second is
- [07:59] whether the final report generat are
- [08:01] actually grounded by the information
- [08:02] collector and if you're building a kid
- [08:04] tutorial app you probably have some
- [08:06] special metrics is the answer provided
- [08:08] age appropriate so the key Point here is
- [08:11] that the metric is very diverse and it
- [08:13] should really look at which part of the
- [08:14] system that often break or unstable and
- [08:17] you really care and design a metric
- [08:19] around it and when you design metric
- [08:21] there probably different things you'll
- [08:22] be thinking about for example you might
- [08:24] put a numeric metrix like getting large
- [08:26] L model to provide a numeric evaluation
- [08:29] for from 1 to 5 or you just getting a
- [08:32] model to generate a binary
- [08:33] classification is the answer correct not
- [08:35] and the large Range model can only up
- [08:37] output correct or incorrect you can even
- [08:39] get large Range model to generate two
- [08:41] different outputs as well as some
- [08:43] combination but from my experience the
- [08:45] large L model is not really great at
- [08:47] numeric evaluation it often fail to give
- [08:50] very precise or Parada based evaluation
- [08:52] but when we get lar model to do binary
- [08:55] or even multi output it is actually
- [08:57] performing really well so I often almost
- [08:59] go for the classification or binary type
- [09:01] of evaluation when I use aary model and
- [09:04] after you choose the metrics the next
- [09:06] step is actually build a evaluator so
- [09:08] you want to build a evaluator system
- [09:10] that can actually evaluate the
- [09:11] performance of large Range model system
- [09:13] just like human to do that you will need
- [09:15] to decide two things one is what will be
- [09:17] the data input that this evaluator
- [09:19] should get the input can be as simple as
- [09:22] a user query plus the output of the
- [09:24] large L model system we can also include
- [09:26] some reference data set if you are
- [09:28] preparing a data set that with a
- [09:30] predefined list of task that has ground
- [09:31] trues so the evaluator can use that to
- [09:34] compare on the other side the input can
- [09:36] also be the result of specific step like
- [09:38] knowledge retrieval instead of the whole
- [09:40] large L model system then the evaluator
- [09:42] basic need to generate output which is
- [09:44] evaluation metrics that you defined
- [09:46] earlier so if you're building a rack
- [09:47] system where you want to measure the
- [09:49] retrieval accuracy then you will have
- [09:51] evaluator that the input will be the
- [09:53] user query as well as a retrieve data
- [09:55] and the evaluator will take this to
- [09:57] input and generate output which is r
- [09:59] classification that can either be
- [10:01] relevant or irrelevant actual evaluator
- [10:03] here most likely be a prompt template
- [10:05] that you have designed like for this one
- [10:07] it can be simple as you are comparing a
- [10:09] reference Tex to a question and try to
- [10:11] determine if the reference Tex contain
- [10:13] the information relevant to answer the
- [10:14] question and here's a question this
- [10:16] reference text and now compare this two
- [10:18] result and output only relevant or
- [10:21] irrelevant you can give very specific
- [10:22] description about what this relevant
- [10:24] means and what this irrelevant means on
- [10:25] the other side if you're not building a
- [10:27] rack but actually agent that should
- [10:29] follow specific process then the input
- [10:31] can be the system prompt that you give
- [10:33] agent that contain specific soop or
- [10:35] process that it should follow plus the
- [10:37] full chat history that agent generated
- [10:40] it can give those three different things
- [10:41] to the evaluator and output the metrix
- [10:43] to be whether the agent actually follow
- [10:45] the instruction that it was given and
- [10:47] second whether the agent actually
- [10:49] complete task and sometimes you can even
- [10:51] get a to Output reason as well so you
- [10:53] can understand better if the agent is
- [10:55] not following the instruction which part
- [10:57] did it Miss if I'm building a comy
- [10:59] search agent where I want to test
- [11:00] whether agent has ability to gather as
- [11:02] much information as possible then input
- [11:05] can be the company and list of data
- [11:06] point is should research about as well
- [11:08] as the final result that agent generated
- [11:10] pass on all those things to the large L
- [11:12] model evaluator and output if all
- [11:14] information gathered is yes or no and
- [11:16] this is a problem that I used for this
- [11:17] evaluator it will basically pass on all
- [11:19] those inputs and then say evaluate
- [11:21] result from the research system decide
- [11:23] if the system found answer to all data
- [11:25] point per the answer can only be yes or
- [11:27] no so how you design evaluator prompt
- [11:30] really depends on the metrix you pick up
- [11:32] at first place and the real question
- [11:34] here is how can you making sure this
- [11:35] evaluator prompt actually give accurate
- [11:37] evaluation just like you do so that you
- [11:39] can have confidence in the result
- [11:41] provided so that's where the third step
- [11:43] is quite important to prepare a golden
- [11:45] data set so this basically means you can
- [11:47] prepare a list of testing case which
- [11:50] including both input and output as well
- [11:52] as what is a correct evaluation result
- [11:54] for example once you have this data set
- [11:57] then we can basically still run
- [11:58] evaluation by taking the input output
- [12:00] and generate evaluation result but then
- [12:02] you can compare this evaluation result
- [12:04] to the correct evaluation result and
- [12:06] decide if this evaluation is correct so
- [12:08] you're pretty much creating evaluation
- [12:10] system for the evaluator itself you can
- [12:12] run multiple different cases on this
- [12:14] evaluator with your golden data set to
- [12:16] get understanding about how accurate
- [12:18] this eval is and the question here is
- [12:20] how do you get this golden data set so
- [12:22] there are couple of different ways the
- [12:23] most straightfor ways would be manually
- [12:25] curate data so you can just create
- [12:27] probably a small set like 20 50 or
- [12:29] hundreds of those manually create data
- [12:31] sets where you can just give the correct
- [12:33] evaluation result as a reference but on
- [12:35] the other side after your system going
- [12:37] to production you will actually start
- [12:39] getting a huge amount of real user lock
- [12:41] and with system like LMI or Phenix you
- [12:44] can also go to those system look at user
- [12:46] log and manually annotate your
- [12:48] evaluation output as well and that's why
- [12:50] in system like chbt they will give you
- [12:52] some sumbs up and some down button to
- [12:54] provide feedback if you're just getting
- [12:56] started you can even try to use large
- [12:58] Range model to generate some data set as
- [13:00] well for example if you're building a
- [13:01] rack system where you want to really
- [13:03] push the retrieval accuracy you can
- [13:06] actually get large model to generate a
- [13:07] bunch of different cases by loading
- [13:09] website and gener list of questionable
- [13:11] and output result but no matter how you
- [13:14] get this golden data set the idea here
- [13:16] is you can evaluate your evaluator
- [13:18] iterated it to a point where the result
- [13:20] is pretty accurate so that in the end
- [13:22] you can actually put a life and start
- [13:24] testing against different variations of
- [13:26] your system and compare the results
- [13:28] between different system in terms of the
- [13:29] metrics you define the latency and cost
- [13:32] and that's pretty much it this process
- [13:34] might sound a bit curious but in reality
- [13:36] it's actually very easy to set up with
- [13:38] system like L and phix I'm going to give
- [13:40] you a quick example of how can I create
- [13:42] a evaluation system for a researcher
- [13:44] agent that I just created so I want to
- [13:46] show you example of how I build a
- [13:48] evaluation system of a web research
- [13:50] agent that I built before all the
- [13:52] details and source code in a different
- [13:53] video so you can check out if you want
- [13:55] to dive deeper and the key things I
- [13:57] really care and want to test a lot is
- [13:59] about the research agents's ability to
- [14:01] gather as much information as possible
- [14:03] from different data source so the
- [14:04] metrics I Define here is the info
- [14:06] Gathering whether the agent actually
- [14:07] found all the necessary information that
- [14:09] user requests from internet so I'm going
- [14:11] to show you a step-by-step example of
- [14:13] how I set it up and how I use that to
- [14:15] compare the performance of using the old
- [14:17] GPT model versus the new GPT 40 where
- [14:19] they actually deliver better performance
- [14:21] with cheaper cost so to set up there are
- [14:22] really four steps first we want to use
- [14:25] assistant to actually log the user
- [14:27] request to your large model system and
- [14:29] there are multiple different platforms
- [14:30] you can use com like L Smith or there
- [14:33] also open source version like phix where
- [14:35] you can host yourself and once you set
- [14:37] this up you can start all the user
- [14:39] requests and build a data set out of it
- [14:42] by annotating result and then we're
- [14:43] going to create the evaluator to deliver
- [14:46] the evaluation result so that we can
- [14:48] start evaluating against different
- [14:50] models and variations and compare the
- [14:52] result so that's it but firstly the
- [14:54] setup of logging system and the one I'm
- [14:56] going to Showcase is SL Miss and the
- [14:58] reason I I choose that is because they
- [15:00] kind of have the both evaluation logging
- [15:02] and annotation kind of connect together
- [15:05] which make this process a lot easier so
- [15:07] I'm going to go back to my agent scrier
- [15:09] project that I did last time which is
- [15:11] basically agent that can receive a
- [15:13] website URL as well as a few research
- [15:16] topics and then this agent will go to
- [15:18] the company website to research all the
- [15:20] possible information there and if
- [15:22] nothing found it also go to poate
- [15:24] internet to find more information and as
- [15:26] I mentioned before I've demonstrated the
- [15:28] source code another video which you can
- [15:30] check out if you want to learn more but
- [15:32] this is basically the agent I created
- [15:33] before and as you can see here actually
- [15:36] didn't set up any tracking and to setup
- [15:38] tracking is actually very
- [15:39] straightforward so the way lens miss or
- [15:42] any other logging system works is
- [15:44] basically you can add some special
- [15:45] decorator to the function that you want
- [15:47] to track by adding this add Tris B
- [15:50] before your function and they also
- [15:52] provide some help function to
- [15:53] automatically track all the large range
- [15:55] REM model core as well so all we need to
- [15:57] do is just add this tras bow cre to
- [15:59] every single function that we want to
- [16:01] track the first step is we want to
- [16:02] install lmus if you haven't installed
- [16:05] that yet you can just do pip install L
- [16:07] Smith in your comen line after that you
- [16:09] will need to create API key and then
- [16:11] copy API key to your file one for L
- [16:14] chain API key and also you will need to
- [16:17] turn on this lanching Trac in V2 to be
- [16:19] true so that it will start tracking and
- [16:21] if you want you can also Define a
- [16:23] specific Ling project that you want to
- [16:25] log all the information and at the four
- [16:27] all the data will automatically go to to
- [16:29] default project if you haven't specified
- [16:31] yet and once you did that we can go back
- [16:33] to our researcher. P file and firstly
- [16:35] import two libraries from last miss one
- [16:38] is traceable another is rap open a so I
- [16:41] want to replace this open a. Cline to be
- [16:43] rap open a. Cline so all the lar ler
- [16:46] Modoc code will automatically be loging
- [16:47] LM and then for every single function
- [16:50] that we want to track we can add add
- [16:52] trable decorator so for the scripting
- [16:54] function I can add this add traceable
- [16:57] and you can define a couple things and
- [16:58] one R type it can be tool it can also be
- [17:01] large L model basically the purpose of
- [17:03] round type is identify them differently
- [17:05] in the lens myth so some of will be
- [17:07] large langage model some will be tools
- [17:09] and at default will be Chang as you can
- [17:11] see here each lck here has a different
- [17:13] name this is name that you would Define
- [17:15] here we can basically do add trow round
- [17:18] type equal to Tool and name equal to
- [17:20] script I'm going to do the same same for
- [17:22] the internet search function so just
- [17:24] before this function I will add this
- [17:26] Trace round type equal to Tool and name
- [17:28] equal to internet search same thing for
- [17:30] update data also add to this chat
- [17:33] completion request as well to track this
- [17:35] agent chat completion for this help
- [17:37] function where it is to log the
- [17:39] information in my command line I don't
- [17:41] really need to track this so skip it
- [17:43] memory optimization I also want to track
- [17:45] it so I just add decorator traceable
- [17:47] name equal to optimize memory as well as
- [17:50] call agent and same thing for the two
- [17:52] different steps tro name equal to number
- [17:55] one website domain research and the
- [17:57] number two internet search in the end
- [17:59] the last one traceable for run research
- [18:02] that's pretty much it after I set up all
- [18:04] those traceable next time when I run
- [18:06] this researcher agent it should
- [18:08] automatically log information into L
- [18:10] Smith I can open Terminal to python
- [18:12] researcher. py I can say start running
- [18:15] okay so the agent has finished running
- [18:16] on my end now if I switch back to LMI
- [18:19] you can see this new session show up
- [18:21] already and if I click on that you can
- [18:23] see the four traits of every single
- [18:25] steps agent did to complete this task so
- [18:27] firstly there will be a WR research
- [18:29] which is top level function that we
- [18:31] tracked here and then the first stage is
- [18:33] website domain research which is one of
- [18:35] the first stag that we track here called
- [18:37] number one website domain research and
- [18:40] inside that you can see every time when
- [18:41] a certain function has been called it
- [18:43] will be automatically tracked from the
- [18:45] agent chat completion and optimized
- [18:47] memory I can also click on the top level
- [18:49] number one website domain research to
- [18:51] say the output of the first stage is
- [18:53] that it didn't find any information on
- [18:56] the website domain from Discord that's
- [18:58] why trigger the second stage of the
- [19:00] internet search in the end it found the
- [19:02] result for every single field eventually
- [19:05] so that's pretty much it from this point
- [19:07] every single time when a user have a
- [19:09] research task the information will be
- [19:11] automatically logged into the system
- [19:12] from there you can actually start
- [19:14] creating a data set that can be used for
- [19:16] evaluating the system so you can see
- [19:18] there are two options here one is add to
- [19:21] data set and another is add to NQ so n
- [19:24] Play basically allow you to give your
- [19:25] human evaluation result to create that
- [19:27] golden data set set probably you won't
- [19:29] see any metrics here yet because you
- [19:31] haven't really connect any metric to
- [19:34] this project but once you set up you can
- [19:35] actually give your human evaluation but
- [19:38] on the other side you can just add this
- [19:39] to data set as well so data set is
- [19:42] basically a collection of different
- [19:44] cases that you want to test including
- [19:46] both input and output you can create a
- [19:47] new data set let's say grab scraping
- [19:50] research agent click crate and you can
- [19:53] also make change to the input and output
- [19:56] here as well if you want and then click
- [19:58] submit then this testing data set has
- [20:00] been added for you to test later and if
- [20:03] I switch back to data set tab you will
- [20:05] see this new data set called Web
- [20:06] scraping research agent if you click
- [20:09] inside this one example here from your
- [20:12] user lck and you can basically just
- [20:13] repeat this process to look at all the
- [20:15] user lock and pick up the good ones that
- [20:17] you want to use for testing later
- [20:19] because for each one of those data set
- [20:21] you can actually create evaluators so
- [20:23] lesm miss do provide some U for you to
- [20:25] create a new evaluator you can choose
- [20:27] some of the template that they already
- [20:29] have but you can also create your own
- [20:30] but I'm going to show you how can you
- [20:32] create in the code direct so in our case
- [20:34] as I mentioned before the key things I
- [20:36] want to test is does this agent system
- [20:39] collect as much information as possible
- [20:41] for all data points that it requested
- [20:44] and for that purpose I will just create
- [20:45] evaluator to test just that whether all
- [20:48] data point user request has been
- [20:49] collected so I'll flip back to our
- [20:52] python code and first they import two
- [20:54] new libraries one is evaluate this will
- [20:56] allow us to run evaluation let's say you
- [20:59] have a few example in your data set the
- [21:01] evaluate function will basically run
- [21:03] your latest lar model system against
- [21:06] this data sets and do the evaluation and
- [21:09] we also import lens mist of schemas to
- [21:11] import Rong and example so Rong means
- [21:14] the actual output from your L model
- [21:16] system example is where you can get the
- [21:18] reference information from the example
- [21:20] data in your data set and then our first
- [21:22] create a function called research evolve
- [21:24] with inputs so first we will try to get
- [21:26] a few inputs from the test data sets one
- [21:29] is entity name website data points those
- [21:31] are basically the input variables we
- [21:33] have in the testing data set which is
- [21:36] website entity name and data points to
- [21:38] search and then I'll do the wrong
- [21:40] research function that we create above
- [21:42] and return the data points as output
- [21:45] then we're going to create the actual
- [21:46] evaluator so evaluator I'm going to
- [21:48] create is all data collected check and
- [21:51] we have two input one is a wrong and
- [21:53] another is example so we need a wrong to
- [21:55] get actual output from the lar model
- [21:58] system with be and example will allow us
- [22:00] to get the reference output as well as
- [22:02] test case inputs so we'll get all those
- [22:05] relevant data company data points result
- [22:07] and gr choose which is reference output
- [22:10] then we will put together a system prop
- [22:12] like this so I basically just pass it on
- [22:14] both the research task the result from
- [22:16] our research system as well as reference
- [22:19] result from the human researcher and ask
- [22:21] it to evaluate if all the information
- [22:24] has been collected it can be either yes
- [22:26] or no and then I basically use a model
- [22:28] to do this evaluation and here I did
- [22:31] actually use the same model that I was
- [22:32] using for the large L model system which
- [22:35] normally is not the best practice most
- [22:37] of the time you do want to use a
- [22:38] different model to do the evaluation but
- [22:41] in my case I'm actually not testing the
- [22:42] model itself I'm actually testing the
- [22:44] output of the whole agent system so I
- [22:46] still use the same model just for
- [22:48] convenience and in the end I would do a
- [22:50] transformation if all information found
- [22:52] is yes then our set score to be one
- [22:55] otherwise our set score to be zero the
- [22:57] reason I do this is because in L Smith
- [22:59] what the Matrix that number will be able
- [23:01] to give us a overall score across all
- [23:04] the test case for example in this
- [23:06] specific one one out of four case
- [23:08] actually succeed and all the out three
- [23:10] cases fell so it gave me a average score
- [23:13] 0.25 so this quite useful to get a
- [23:15] summary of the experiment and in the end
- [23:17] I will output key to be only INF for
- [23:19] Fone and score to be a score we output
- [23:22] and so far I couldn't find a Best
- [23:24] practice about how to Output multiple
- [23:26] different Matrix cuz unless seems like
- [23:29] one evaluator can only output one score
- [23:31] but if there any other good ways please
- [23:33] comment below and let me know in the end
- [23:35] I'm going to start a evaluate where I
- [23:38] will put a system function that we going
- [23:40] to run to first par the data Cent name
- [23:43] which is the one that we create here the
- [23:45] evaluator point to the function that we
- [23:47] create above and experiment prefix as
- [23:50] well as metadata and that's pretty much
- [23:51] it so first I do want to run a quick
- [23:53] benchmark test with the model I was used
- [23:56] before which jpd for Turbo and I will
- [23:59] open the terminal and run the script so
- [24:01] you can see the agent start running
- [24:03] which will take a while but if I flip
- [24:05] back to LM miss you can see that there's
- [24:07] a new experiment show up here called GPD
- [24:10] 4 Turbo and if I click inside you can
- [24:12] see all those two sessions are running
- [24:15] in real time and showing us how much
- [24:17] token it consumed and how much money it
- [24:19] cost on large motorite and if I click on
- [24:22] this view Trace button it will show me
- [24:24] the four Trace up to this point now you
- [24:26] can see that the evaluation has finished
- [24:28] if I switch back to the lens Miss so
- [24:31] result you can see from our very small
- [24:33] testing cases is one case succeed one
- [24:36] case fa and I can click on The View
- [24:38] Trace button to see the result so test
- [24:41] is basically I ask agent to search three
- [24:43] piece of data about Discord about a
- [24:46] certain company one is whether this
- [24:47] company provide catering to the
- [24:49] employees how many employees do they
- [24:51] have and what different office locations
- [24:53] are and the result is that the agent
- [24:55] didn't really find whether the company
- [24:57] provide catering but it does find the
- [24:59] number of employees as well as office
- [25:02] location the other case is the same list
- [25:04] of dat points but different company
- [25:06] safety culture and this time it
- [25:08] successfully find the company actually
- [25:10] offer in House Catering to the crew for
- [25:13] breakfast lunch and snacks and there are
- [25:16] roughly 696 employees and six office in
- [25:19] total across those locations and you can
- [25:22] see evaluation result also reflect that
- [25:24] so the safety culture all info find is
- [25:26] one versus Discord all info fun with
- [25:29] zero and if you want you can actually
- [25:31] click inside and copy paste whole input
- [25:33] so now we have this Benchmark about the
- [25:35] GPD terrible performance with our system
- [25:38] as well as latency and token cost and
- [25:40] you can see that a roughly cost from $1
- [25:43] to 1.6 so let's say now we want to test
- [25:47] whether new model gb4 actually improve
- [25:49] the performance and ideally with cheaper
- [25:51] cost as well so I can just move up and
- [25:54] change the GPT model to GPT 40 and run
- [25:57] this test again so GPD 40 test also
- [26:00] finished and if I go back to the last
- [26:03] miss you can see this new one called GPD
- [26:05] 40 experiment if I click inside great so
- [26:08] both of them actually succeed if I click
- [26:10] on the first Discord one I can see they
- [26:12] actually find some specific information
- [26:14] for every single piece of information we
- [26:16] need and I believe the overall cost to
- [26:18] complete task is going to be lower as
- [26:20] well cuz we can click on this add button
- [26:22] and compare with another experiment we
- [26:24] did in this case it would be gpq for
- [26:25] Turbo so you can actually compare side
- [26:27] by side with the similar cost for
- [26:29] Discord case the gbd 40 actually cost a
- [26:32] little bit lower but completed task
- [26:35] successfully and for cic culture test
- [26:37] case they both complete tasks but gbd4
- [26:40] turbo complete task with much less cost
- [26:43] and if you want you can even do another
- [26:45] task with let's say GPD 3.5 turbo let's
- [26:48] change the model as well as Max token
- [26:51] all right GPD 3.5 also finished and
- [26:53] actually finished really fast the
- [26:55] question now is did it actually complete
- [26:57] task so so if we go back you can see
- [26:59] that GPT 3.5 just completely Miss Mark
- [27:04] even though it's extremely cheap and
- [27:06] again we can add a comparison with all
- [27:08] the other two variation we just did to
- [27:10] do this pop you probably need at least
- [27:13] 20 or 30 different test case but you can
- [27:15] see how powerful this one will be for
- [27:17] your iteration process you can just
- [27:19] change some combination and run the
- [27:21] experiment to get understanding about
- [27:23] what's the real performance of your
- [27:24] latest iteration across multiple
- [27:26] different testing data set and if you
- [27:28] know any other interesting evaluation
- [27:30] system or best practice please comment
- [27:32] below I'd love to try out as well I will
- [27:34] continue posting interesting AI
- [27:36] knowledge and projects I'm doing so if
- [27:38] you enjoy this video please can
