- [00:00] I'm Ravit Ja Chili. I'm the head of
- [00:02] solutions engineering at scale. Agentic
- [00:04] AI is impacting the industry in several
- [00:08] different ways. Specifically for scale,
- [00:10] we are working with some of the leading
- [00:12] companies in different industries in
- [00:14] bringing some of the knowledge, complex
- [00:16] knowledge work that they're doing into
- [00:18] production with agentic workflows. And
- [00:21] the way that we are doing it is by
- [00:23] bringing all these tribal knowledge
- [00:25] that's in the head of these thememes
- [00:28] into [music]
- [00:29] agentic AI solutions by capturing all
- [00:32] the knowledge that's in their sitting in
- [00:34] their heads and we are building the
- [00:35] agents specifically training them to
- [00:37] solve those problems. The AWS services
- [00:39] that scale is using right now it could
- [00:41] be anywhere from EC2 instances all the
- [00:44] way to the AWS managed AI services like
- [00:46] bedrock. Scale's partnership with AWS
- [00:49] helped us innovate and grow in the way
- [00:51] that we've learned from AWS leadership
- [00:54] principle of customer obsession and how
- [00:56] scale could also bring a similar
- [00:58] customer obsession in solving enterprise
- [01:00] problems. AWS is helping scale be more
- [01:03] innovative and solve our customers
- [01:05] problems.
