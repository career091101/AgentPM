- [00:00] Thank you for the for the introduction.
- [00:02] Um,
- [00:04] ideally it was not gonna be me talking
- [00:07] today. Um, so I'm here as a replacement
- [00:09] forana. I don't want to steal her
- [00:11] thunderish. These are her slides. So
- [00:14] she's still here with us. Uh,
- [00:16] >> she's alive.
- [00:17] >> Yes. Yes, she she is. She is.
- [00:21] So the idea for today is to think about
- [00:26] what kind of challenges we face when
- [00:29] doing what we traditionally call
- [00:31] knowledge work and how can we use AI to
- [00:35] solve those challenges.
- [00:39] And to do that, I I'm going to take this
- [00:42] example probably to its extreme. Um,
- [00:46] and think about an invoice.
- [00:50] We all use invoices in our daily lives.
- [00:54] Most often when we buy a coffee from our
- [00:57] local coffee shop and we might proceed
- [00:59] to throw it away. But for a lot of
- [01:01] business applications, keeping track of
- [01:03] invoices is quite important.
- [01:07] And one use case that we see often and
- [01:09] often it's the problem of invoice
- [01:12] reconciliation. That is I have a
- [01:15] contract that says um this company is
- [01:18] going to provide these services over
- [01:19] let's say a year and every month they're
- [01:21] going to send me an invoice. Now
- [01:25] most of the time there's humans involved
- [01:27] in creating invoices. So an invoice
- [01:30] might not exactly be what I expect in my
- [01:32] contract. And I want to be able to check
- [01:35] those invoices to make sure that they
- [01:37] are what we agreed upon. This is one
- [01:41] example that we see a lot in the
- [01:43] industry where we have these lots of
- [01:46] providers, lot of contracts, lot of
- [01:48] invoices and we want to make sure that
- [01:49] all these invoices make sense. So how do
- [01:52] we approach a problem like this
- [01:55] um
- [01:57] with AI?
- [01:59] And so it's it's not trivial that I can
- [02:02] just throw the contract, throw the image
- [02:04] and say, is this correct? Like we we
- [02:06] would love that to be the case, but
- [02:08] there are some nuances that make this
- [02:10] process a little bit harder.
- [02:13] So let me run through an example on how
- [02:17] this may work. Here we have uh I have
- [02:20] uploaded a couple of contracts. I have
- [02:22] uploaded a couple of invoices. And so
- [02:25] one of those contracts might specify the
- [02:28] price or the delivery date for
- [02:30] particular items,
- [02:32] but they don't match the invoice. And I
- [02:34] want to be very quickly be able to
- [02:36] highlight
- [02:38] what's going on. So that that's sort of
- [02:40] what it looks to to do invoice
- [02:42] reconciliation. And if you're interested
- [02:44] in looking at a demo uh more closely, we
- [02:47] are having a demo later today. So do
- [02:49] come to the to the demo.
- [02:53] So
- [02:55] what what makes this problem slightly
- [02:57] harder than what it seems? Why can I
- [02:59] just show or throw my contract my
- [03:02] invoice to judge GVD and ask like is
- [03:04] this fine? And it turns out that most
- [03:07] LLMs or textbased we are now getting
- [03:10] multimodal LLMs but contracts are very
- [03:13] comp PDFs are very complex structures um
- [03:17] made for human understanding where
- [03:19] layouts, images, plots um or are very
- [03:23] easy for a human to understand but not
- [03:25] as CC for um an LLM.
- [03:29] And so
- [03:32] there's there's a lot of work that needs
- [03:34] to be done to extract all this
- [03:38] information from these documents before
- [03:40] they can be they can fed to an LM. And
- [03:42] that's a crucial part of getting these
- [03:44] applications right. Making sure that
- [03:46] whatever you're feeding your large
- [03:48] language model, it's exactly what they
- [03:51] need to solve this problem. And that's
- [03:53] where Llama index comes in.
- [03:58] So how how might we solve this problem?
- [04:01] And this is like a very rough
- [04:03] approximation. I'm going to show a more
- [04:04] complete example um in a second. The
- [04:08] idea is that we might first upload a a
- [04:11] contract and then that contract is pors.
- [04:14] And so if I I do this every day, so I'm
- [04:16] very familiar with this, but the idea is
- [04:18] that we have a PDF and we're going to
- [04:20] extract text from that. And we often end
- [04:24] up with a markdown representation which
- [04:26] is basically plain text of that
- [04:27] contract. That's what I mean by parsing.
- [04:30] Um for this particular application I
- [04:33] might need to find specific clauses on
- [04:36] that contract. Um and contracts might be
- [04:40] very large. So I need to do look up of
- [04:43] different parts of the text. This can be
- [04:46] achieved for example using rag. And so
- [04:48] for these particular applications once
- [04:50] we parse this contract once we have this
- [04:53] text representation of the contract we
- [04:55] are going to throw it into an index uh
- [04:59] into a vector database. We have llama
- [05:01] index uh in lama cloud for this and we
- [05:05] have the first step of this process
- [05:07] ready which is processing the contract.
- [05:12] And again, contracts that look like this
- [05:15] might have um an address somewhere on
- [05:18] the top. It might have a table. Again,
- [05:20] these are complex structures that are
- [05:22] easy for humans, but not necessarily so
- [05:25] much for lens.
- [05:27] And this is how a contract that sparse
- [05:30] might look like. You can see the table
- [05:32] there at the end. I can is how nice.
- [05:35] Then again here
- [05:40] once we have the contract then the next
- [05:42] step it's the invoice. What do I need?
- [05:45] What might I do with the invoice? First
- [05:48] step is always parsing again. Uh we need
- [05:51] to get all this information as text so
- [05:53] that we can do more interesting things
- [05:55] with it. Um but for invoice we actually
- [05:58] need a lot more details. We need to know
- [06:01] for example the name of the company and
- [06:04] we need to find the name of the company
- [06:05] that invoice. We might need to get all
- [06:07] the line items and exactly what was the
- [06:09] amount for each line item. Um
- [06:13] so for this we have a
- [06:16] a product called pars that I'm going to
- [06:18] mention in a second
- [06:20] that allows us to basically solve this
- [06:22] step at once.
- [06:25] So what is llama index and what do we
- [06:30] do? Um
- [06:34] we provide at the very core level
- [06:40] these building blocks that are necessary
- [06:42] for doing knowledge work with AI pores
- [06:48] extract classification of documents. All
- [06:51] these are essential tools that you will
- [06:53] need eventually if you're building
- [06:55] applications that involve documents.
- [06:59] You might know us better for our open
- [07:01] source framework
- [07:03] um that builds upon these tools to build
- [07:06] complex AI um applications and AI
- [07:09] agents. And we are starting to release
- [07:14] agent templates
- [07:16] um that allow you to very quickly
- [07:18] prototype u complex agentic applications
- [07:22] that use documents as their main input
- [07:25] and transform them into whatever you
- [07:27] need to build. for example, in
- [07:29] reconciliation. So the idea is that the
- [07:31] example that I show,
- [07:34] you should be able to get started with
- [07:35] one of the templates and in a very few
- [07:38] minutes get up and running with a
- [07:39] properly agenda application that
- [07:42] ingests real documents.
- [07:47] So about
- [07:49] the core building blocks, I think that
- [07:53] llama is is really
- [07:56] something special. It's the building
- [07:59] block that allows you to go from PDF to
- [08:01] text. Um, and there is a lot of
- [08:04] optimization behind the scenes to make
- [08:06] sure that we understand layouts, that we
- [08:09] understand images, that we understand
- [08:12] tables, that we understand charts. And
- [08:14] so, regardless of how complex your
- [08:17] document is, there's a good chance that
- [08:20] you're going to get much better results
- [08:21] by parsing it first and then using an
- [08:24] LM.
- [08:27] Now if what you need is structure
- [08:29] output. For example, for an invoice I
- [08:31] need line items like what was charged,
- [08:33] how much was it, when was it, then I
- [08:36] usually want a JSON output for my task.
- [08:40] And here is where extract shines.
- [08:42] Extracts allow you to specify a schema.
- [08:46] These are the things that I want to get.
- [08:48] and
- [08:50] ingests your document, parses it behind
- [08:53] the scenes and then gives you the
- [08:55] structure output that is essentially
- [08:57] what you want.
- [08:59] And so here you can see we have a
- [09:02] feeling from Nvidia.
- [09:04] I might only care about certain specific
- [09:06] fields and so I can just specify that as
- [09:08] a schema and I get that um those values
- [09:11] only.
- [09:13] And it's very easy to get started. You
- [09:15] can build your own schemas, but we have
- [09:17] a a few that are prefilled for you to
- [09:20] use. We also have a mode that
- [09:22] automatically suggests a schema for you.
- [09:25] So again, it's very easy to to get
- [09:27] started.
- [09:29] If you're a developer, you can also go
- [09:31] the programming route and you can do
- [09:33] this by specifying a py schema here. The
- [09:37] key is that these descriptions field
- [09:40] here are what the LM will use behind the
- [09:43] scenes to understand what's going on.
- [09:45] And so they're really really important
- [09:48] and so if you skim on this results might
- [09:52] not be as good
- [09:55] but again it's just a couple of lines to
- [09:57] get sorted. Uh also if you go the code
- [10:00] route um we are going to share the
- [10:02] slides after the talk but there is a
- [10:04] couple of QR codes um here. This one
- [10:07] takes you to tutorial on how to use
- [10:09] extract for these feelings.
- [10:14] Um now
- [10:16] if you want to build
- [10:19] AI applications,
- [10:21] agentic applications at some point you
- [10:24] might need to start putting all these
- [10:25] building blocks together. And so
- [10:28] in the ideal world, we just write agents
- [10:32] or function agents where we specify a
- [10:34] list of tools and
- [10:37] the agent automatically knows what tool
- [10:40] to call in what order to get the right
- [10:42] output and that works great. In
- [10:45] practice, we sometimes have specific
- [10:49] logic that we want to make sure is
- [10:51] executed in the right order and some of
- [10:53] those decisions will be agentic. We
- [10:56] might have agents that solves particular
- [10:59] tasks, but we want a specific flow um of
- [11:04] our application. And here is where agent
- [11:06] workflows shine. One of our core
- [11:10] open-source contributions is the idea of
- [11:12] agent workflows that allow you to
- [11:16] build any application specifying
- [11:19] different steps and how those steps
- [11:21] connect. Um the idea is that this is
- [11:24] event driven. is built for agents. Most
- [11:27] of our agent abstractions are built on
- [11:30] top of this. Um, and this is a great way
- [11:34] to build agenda applications. This is
- [11:36] what a the simplest workflow might look
- [11:40] like. We can define steps. These steps
- [11:43] just print and do nothing. And then
- [11:46] steps communicate by specifying events.
- [11:49] So first step emits an event. Step two
- [11:52] wait expects that event. And so when it
- [11:54] sees it's firing from this, we'll
- [11:56] execute. And this way you can build a
- [11:59] very distributed application by specifi
- [12:02] specifying when this thing should run.
- [12:04] This is really useful when you're
- [12:07] processing documents where a task might
- [12:10] take a minute for example and this other
- [12:12] task needs to fire only when this is
- [12:14] done. Uh this manages all that for you
- [12:18] uh without uh been blocking.
- [12:22] And so we also have tools to visualize
- [12:25] some of the workflows. And so if you run
- [12:27] this workflow, you might get a
- [12:29] visualization such as this one.
- [12:34] Back to our invoice reconciler. If I
- [12:37] were to implement this as a workflow,
- [12:40] this is what this workflow might look
- [12:42] like. I have a step that uploads a file.
- [12:45] Um, I might have a classification step
- [12:47] that we have a classification model that
- [12:49] decide if this is an invoice or a
- [12:52] contract. If it's an invoice, I might
- [12:54] emit an invoice event and I'm going to
- [12:57] sort of start the workflow that deals
- [12:59] with invoices. So, I'm going to parse
- [13:01] the invoice. I'm going to
- [13:06] extract it. Um, I'm going to go back to
- [13:10] the contract and I'm going to reconcile
- [13:13] it. If I have a contract, I'm going to
- [13:16] get the name from the contract. I'm
- [13:18] going to index that contract. I'm going
- [13:20] to say that contract was indexed.
- [13:23] And when I'm reconciling an invoice
- [13:26] here, basically what I have it's the
- [13:28] extracted invoice. I have the extracted
- [13:31] contract and I'm going to use a
- [13:34] structure output lm. This is not
- [13:36] necessarily an agent. Uh and say this is
- [13:39] what my output should look like. um from
- [13:43] the PORs invoice and from the PORs
- [13:46] contract try to find if there are any
- [13:48] discrepancies and this step could be as
- [13:51] complex as as you want it to be.
- [13:56] We are also building tools to make it as
- [13:58] easy as possible to deploy agent. So if
- [14:00] you build an agentic application with a
- [14:02] workflow, we want to make sure that you
- [14:04] can deploy it very fast. And so in this
- [14:07] case we developed a tool called llama
- [14:11] that is the one that has all these
- [14:13] agentic templates. So if you type lacl
- [14:16] in it this will
- [14:19] very quickly um allow you to generate
- [14:23] one of these templates and then you can
- [14:26] deploy it you can run it locally but you
- [14:28] also get all the code. So if you
- [14:31] actually want to make any changes to the
- [14:33] application, you want to change the
- [14:34] schema, you want to change the UI, uh
- [14:37] everything is there um for you to to
- [14:41] customize.
- [14:45] We are going to be doing a demo of
- [14:49] exactly this and how this works and how
- [14:51] you can get started deploying an agent
- [14:53] on the demo later. So I think it's 5:30
- [14:56] demo booth is over there.
- [14:59] Um,
- [15:01] finally
- [15:02] we wrote a paper on how to use lama
- [15:06] index with weight and biases. You can
- [15:10] find the link to that blog here uh if
- [15:13] you're interested.
- [15:15] I say we is was but again I'm still in
- [15:18] her talk so I I get to do this again. Uh
- [15:24] if you're interested in how
- [15:28] when to use pores, when to use extract,
- [15:31] um what is OCR and why we might need
- [15:33] pors and not just OCR and a document,
- [15:36] these are two interesting blog posts
- [15:38] that will be linked with the talk. Uh if
- [15:43] you're interested in getting started
- [15:44] with agents, this is your main QR code
- [15:47] that will take you to
- [15:49] the demo how to properly build these
- [15:51] applications.
- [15:56] And this is it. We are, as I mentioned,
- [16:01] we have our demo and we have swag. So,
- [16:06] if you're interested in one of these
- [16:07] very cute hats or have any questions
- [16:10] about Llama Agents, happy to approach me
- [16:13] or Mutasa there, just search for the
- [16:15] hats and we're happy to exchange uh one
- [16:18] of these hats for your time.
- [16:21] All right.
- [16:23] Thank you.
