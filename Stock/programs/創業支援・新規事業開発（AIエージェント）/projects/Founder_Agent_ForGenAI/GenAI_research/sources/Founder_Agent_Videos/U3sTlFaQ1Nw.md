- [00:00] Today marks the launch of Gemini 3.0,
- [00:03] Google's most advanced AI model.
- [00:05] Combining state-of-the-art reasoning,
- [00:07] multimodal understanding, and a
- [00:09] capabilities to instantly turn ideas
- [00:11] into apps, workflows, or insights. It's
- [00:14] the next generation model that's built
- [00:16] to learn, build, and plan anything with
- [00:19] unprecedented speed and intelligence. In
- [00:21] coding, the Gemini 3.0 O delivers
- [00:24] state-of-the-art performance with top
- [00:25] scores on live codebench and terminal
- [00:28] bench and other frontier benchmarks. And
- [00:30] alongside this release, Google also
- [00:33] unveiled Google's anti-gravity IDE, a
- [00:36] fully free next generation ID that
- [00:39] brings software development into the
- [00:40] agent first era, powered entirely by
- [00:43] Gemini 3.0. Think of it as Google's
- [00:45] counter to cursor, featuring everything
- [00:47] you'd expect from advanced AI editing
- [00:50] with tab autocomp completion and natural
- [00:52] language code commands with configurable
- [00:54] agents and deep contextaware workflows.
- [00:58] This is an IDE that also features higher
- [01:00] level abstractions, which is a more
- [01:02] intuitive taskbased system that shows
- [01:05] essential artifacts, verification
- [01:07] results, and agent discussions. And it
- [01:09] helps you build trust in each step.
- [01:12] There's also cross surface agents. This
- [01:14] is where you can synchronize agents
- [01:16] control across your editor, terminal,
- [01:18] and browser for seamless end-to-end
- [01:20] development. You also have user
- [01:22] feedback, which is where it will easily
- [01:25] inject feedback across any surface or
- [01:28] artifact to guide, correct, and refine
- [01:30] an agent's work. And lastly, you also
- [01:33] have an agent first experience with this
- [01:35] editor where you can manage multiple
- [01:37] agents simultaneously across any
- [01:39] workspace using one unified mission
- [01:41] control view. This is just wild cuz just
- [01:44] take a look at this example where
- [01:45] anti-gravity's aensi capabilities was
- [01:47] capable of building a fully functional
- [01:50] collaborative multi-whiteboard
- [01:51] application where multiple people can
- [01:54] draw, brainstorm, and sketch ideas
- [01:56] together. All generated end to end by
- [01:58] leveraging the full power of Gemini 3.0.
- [02:01] note. And the best part is is that you
- [02:03] have the ability to access this
- [02:04] completely for free with the individual
- [02:07] plan. You can get started with the
- [02:09] Google account. It's rate limited, but
- [02:10] you're going to be able to get a
- [02:12] generous amount of use cases out of this
- [02:14] model with the new ID Google has. And to
- [02:18] get started, head over to the
- [02:19] anti-gravity website, which I'll leave a
- [02:20] link to in the description below. And
- [02:22] what you can do is click on download for
- [02:24] your operating system. This is where you
- [02:26] can install it for whatever operating
- [02:28] system you may have, whether that's
- [02:29] Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Once
- [02:31] installed, you can get started with the
- [02:32] setup process. This is where you can
- [02:34] either start fresh or import settings
- [02:37] from other IDs you may have. I'm going
- [02:39] to do this for VS Code. And then I'm
- [02:41] going to set my editor theme type. And
- [02:44] then we can have it so that we can use
- [02:46] the anti-gravity agent type. This is
- [02:49] where you can use the recommended agent
- [02:51] assisted development process or you can
- [02:53] have it so that you can review every
- [02:56] sort of generation by the AI. You can
- [02:58] also set custom configurations. I
- [03:00] believe it's best set for the agent
- [03:03] driven uh assisted development. And now
- [03:06] what you can do is click next and then
- [03:08] you can configure the key bindings
- [03:10] extensions and command line. Once that
- [03:12] is set, you can then sign in with your
- [03:14] Google account and get started with
- [03:15] this.
- [03:17] And there we go. This is the
- [03:18] anti-gravity IDE. It is a VS Code clone.
- [03:22] And you can see on the left hand side,
- [03:24] you can manage, explore, the code
- [03:26] search. You also have the source
- [03:27] control. All of the features that you
- [03:28] would see within VS Code. All of your
- [03:30] extensions will be also displayed over
- [03:32] here. None of them have been installed
- [03:34] yet, but you can easily manage all of
- [03:36] them directly from here. And then you
- [03:38] can open up your folder. And then you
- [03:40] can open up the agent manager. This is a
- [03:43] new feature built within anti-gravity.
- [03:46] The agent manager is the mission control
- [03:48] for running multiple agents at the same
- [03:51] time. So, if you're going to be running
- [03:52] multiple agents simultaneously, you're
- [03:54] going to be able to manage them directly
- [03:56] over here. And you can essentially chat
- [03:58] with all the agents with the Gemini 3
- [04:01] Pro high model so that you can easily
- [04:03] work with it to accomplish any task.
- [04:06] There's two modes that you can use,
- [04:08] planning and fast. Planning is going to
- [04:10] take a bit more time to use deep
- [04:12] research to solve complex tasks. And
- [04:14] then the fast method is just deploying
- [04:16] it with a faster agent to execute these
- [04:19] tasks. Now what I'm going to do is have
- [04:21] it deploy multiple agents to create a
- [04:23] cananband board to deploy multiple
- [04:25] agents to tackle any task. So it's an
- [04:28] inception where I'm going to have it
- [04:30] work on creating a canban board which is
- [04:32] like a dashboard where I can work on
- [04:34] deploying and using these agents to
- [04:37] tackle other tasks. This is where it has
- [04:40] built the plan that you can approve. If
- [04:42] you approve of it, you can then proceed
- [04:43] forward and if not, you can obviously
- [04:45] request it to iterate further on it. If
- [04:48] you click on this Chrome icon, this will
- [04:50] have you install the antsgravity browser
- [04:52] control agent. This is where it can
- [04:55] better control your browser so that you
- [04:58] can debug as well as execute different
- [05:00] tasks. So, a couple of different example
- [05:02] use cases is you can have it work on
- [05:04] debugging for quality assurance testing,
- [05:07] monitoring dashboards, and get live
- [05:09] feedback to your AI agent faster than
- [05:12] something like just taking screenshots.
- [05:14] This relates to the dev tools that we
- [05:16] had mentioned previously on our Chrome
- [05:18] video. But with anti-gravity's agent
- [05:21] manager, you can see that it will deploy
- [05:22] multiple agents to work on executing all
- [05:25] of these tasks for you. You can see that
- [05:27] it has finished fixing and preparing the
- [05:30] multi- Asian canband board. We can
- [05:32] actually open up the walkthrough as to
- [05:34] how you can set this up and you can use
- [05:37] the npm install command to get it
- [05:39] running. And once you approve of this,
- [05:41] you can then obviously start it up. But
- [05:43] if you scroll all the way to the top,
- [05:45] you can see all the agents that were
- [05:47] deployed to code out all the components,
- [05:49] all the different pages to have this
- [05:52] functional. Now within the anti-gravity
- [05:54] IDE, you also have the chat panel where
- [05:57] you can interact with the agent. This is
- [05:59] where you can use it like line or like
- [06:01] other extensions to help you code and
- [06:04] build anything. Just take a look at it.
- [06:05] Right now it is using the browser agent
- [06:08] and it is working on controlling the
- [06:10] browser to now debug the app that it has
- [06:14] created. And there we go. We have the
- [06:16] multi- aent canband board that works.
- [06:18] And this is where you can see all the
- [06:20] tasks that it will work on like the
- [06:22] initial research, the setup environment.
- [06:24] They'll also design a database. These
- [06:26] are just a list of different tasks that
- [06:27] it can execute. And all you got to do
- [06:29] now is just deploy the agent. And this
- [06:32] is where it's connected to actually the
- [06:34] backend within VS Code. And it can
- [06:37] actually execute all these tasks like
- [06:39] initiating the research, setting up the
- [06:41] environment. And as you saw, it was able
- [06:43] to do all of that quite quickly. And
- [06:45] just to showcase something cool, this is
- [06:47] where I am working with the agent
- [06:49] directly built within the panel. And
- [06:52] there is an artifacts that you can work
- [06:54] with. So if you click on the artifacts,
- [06:56] it will give you a live visualization of
- [06:58] what it's working on currently. This is
- [07:00] where it has worked on the
- [07:01] implementation plan. And if you approve
- [07:04] of this plan, you can then click on
- [07:06] proceed and it will start working on
- [07:08] deploying agents to execute that plan.
- [07:10] But think of this as a cool way to
- [07:12] visualize what the agent is working on.
- [07:15] So if you actually have a full-on
- [07:16] functional app, you can actually point
- [07:18] out certain things like adding a comment
- [07:20] to this line and improving it. Or you
- [07:22] can highlight a certain section so that
- [07:24] you can deploy agents to work on
- [07:26] improving a feature or prototyping a new
- [07:28] feature. What I really like is that
- [07:30] there's also a review changes section
- [07:32] that gives you a good view of all the
- [07:35] diff changes across multiple files. And
- [07:37] there we go. We have a browserbased Mac
- [07:40] OS style operating system. And this is
- [07:42] where we can enter in password. It could
- [07:45] be anything which it states over here.
- [07:47] So we're going to click enter. And there
- [07:49] we go. This is beautiful. This actually
- [07:52] looks exactly like a Mac OS. Doesn't
- [07:54] have a background, but we have a Safari.
- [07:57] We also have the file manager. You also
- [07:59] have the terminal, the notes app, the
- [08:02] actual calculator, calendar, and a
- [08:04] couple of other things. This is the
- [08:06] capability of this app. You can see I
- [08:09] just changed the background of the
- [08:11] operating system. This is how incredible
- [08:13] anti-gravity's capability is. If you

- [08:36] anti-gravity. This is something that's
- [08:38] much more than just a basic agentic IDE.
- [08:41] It is something that lets you harvest
- [08:43] the ability of the Gemini 3.0 model at
- [08:46] its full potential. I highly recommend
- [08:48] that you try this out. This is something
