- [00:00] today we're diving into the fascinating
- [00:02] world of AI agents which is a technology
- [00:04] that's not only reshaping Industries but
- [00:06] also impacting our daily lives and jobs
- [00:09] in the next few minutes I'm going to
- [00:10] explain to you what AI agents are their
- [00:13] impact compare modern agents with
- [00:15] earlier AI systems and outline a
- [00:17] research back approach to building your
- [00:19] own questions that I had and I really
- [00:21] wanted to fully understand I mean even
- [00:24] as someone who is very technical and has
- [00:27] been in AI for a while now consults
- [00:29] companies on AI builds videos on AI goes
- [00:32] to school getting my postgrad in AI I
- [00:35] still couldn't I had some issues
- [00:37] challenges let's say wrapping my head
- [00:39] around what are AI agents and why are
- [00:42] they such a big deal and that's what
- [00:43] we're going to cover today so when you
- [00:44] leave this video you can easily explain
- [00:47] what they are and how to build your
- [00:49] [Music]
- [00:51] own so what exactly is an AI agent at
- [00:55] its core an AI agent is a software
- [00:57] system designed to perceive its
- [00:59] environment process information and take
- [01:02] actions to achieve specific goals
- [01:04] imagine it as an intelligent assistant
- [01:06] that works independently handling tasks
- [01:09] without needing constant human oversight
- [01:11] okay but it brings up the question then
- [01:13] why what makes AI agents so exciting
- [01:15] today well it's their ability to learn
- [01:18] adapt and integrate seamlessly with
- [01:20] other Technologies which is really
- [01:22] transforming the way we work live and
- [01:24] interact with the world now there are
- [01:26] two broad categories that you really
- [01:28] need to know about one is rule-based
- [01:29] based agents these follow predetermined
- [01:32] rules and are excellent for simple
- [01:34] repetitive tasks for instance many
- [01:36] customer support chatbots operate on
- [01:38] predefined scripts to handle FAQs their
- [01:40] responses are fixed making them reliable
- [01:42] for routine queries but they can only
- [01:45] handle what's being explicitly
- [01:46] programmed to them and this is where
- [01:48] learning based AI Agents come in these
- [01:51] leverage machine learning to adapt over
- [01:53] time they improve by analyzing data from
- [01:56] past interactions this is similar to the
- [01:58] recommendation engine on services such
- [02:00] as Netflix and Spotify instead of
- [02:02] sticking to a fixed script they learn to
- [02:04] recognize patterns and nuances allowing
- [02:07] them to deliver more personalized and
- [02:08] context aware responses now let's
- [02:10] combine though the best of both world
- [02:12] and this is exactly what many modern AI
- [02:14] agents do today that I found really
- [02:16] interesting they use a hybrid approach
- [02:18] so they use rule-based for
- [02:20] predictability for tasks that require
- [02:22] consistency where rules are well defined
- [02:25] the rule-based component can ensure
- [02:27] reliable operation and then there's
- [02:29] machine learning for adaptability the
- [02:31] learning based component can handle
- [02:32] things such as variability adapts to new
- [02:35] information and personalized
- [02:36] interactions but it brings up the
- [02:38] question why are they such a big deal in
- [02:40] 2025 everywhere you look you see them AI
- [02:43] agents have reached a new level of
- [02:45] sophistication and integration this year
- [02:47] Well it feels like this year anyways
- [02:49] because it's everywhere you look in the
- [02:50] news one is unprecedented efficiency
- [02:53] thanks to advancements in machine
- [02:55] learning and increased computational
- [02:57] power I mean especially through cloud
- [02:59] computing
- [03:00] AI agents can now handle complex
- [03:02] datadriven tasks Around the Clock
- [03:04] boosting productivity and reducing human
- [03:07] error another reason they're so popular
- [03:09] right now is enhanced personalization I
- [03:12] mean we have vast amounts of data
- [03:13] available and improved algorithms so AI
- [03:16] agents can offer personalized
- [03:18] experiences whether it's tailoring
- [03:20] recommendations optimizing business
- [03:22] processes or enhancing customer service
- [03:25] the ability to learn from Individual
- [03:27] interactions is revolutionizing how
- [03:29] business business and services operate
- [03:31] and this brings us to our third one
- [03:33] which is transformative Innovation
- [03:34] Industries like healthc care Finance
- [03:36] retail and even Transportation are
- [03:38] leveraging AI agents to solve problems
- [03:41] that were once honestly considered
- [03:43] intractable couldn't be solved from
- [03:45] early disease detection to real-time
- [03:48] fraud prevention these agents are
- [03:50] driving Innovation delivering Real
- [03:52] Results and the fourth one is
- [03:54] adaptability in what feels like a really
- [03:56] quickly changing World in a rapidly
- [03:58] evolving Global land apape the ability
- [04:00] of AI agents to adapt to new data and
- [04:03] continuously improve makes them
- [04:04] invaluable they're not just tools for
- [04:06] today they are platforms that grow
- [04:08] smarter over time which is something
- [04:10] really important to know and this really
- [04:12] helps us meet challenges we might not
- [04:13] even realize exist yet so when you think
- [04:15] of AI agents think about they for
- [04:17] automating routine tasks but also which
- [04:20] is very important they are Central to
- [04:21] transforming and enhancing our daily
- [04:23] lives they embody the convergence of
- [04:26] robust rule-based systems we spoke about
- [04:28] to more Dynamic and and machine learning
- [04:31] way Progress Way progress that didn't
- [04:33] really make sense but today's AI agents
- [04:35] can often combine both approaches and
- [04:37] that is key rule-based for Logic for
- [04:39] predictable tasks and machine learning
- [04:41] for adapting to new complex scenarios
- [04:44] but okay great now you understand what
- [04:46] these agents are but why do they matter
- [04:48] so much why is everywhere you look
- [04:50] people speaking about it that's what I
- [04:52] really wanted to understand well a
- [04:54] McKenzie Global Institute report
- [04:56] highlighted that AI driven automation
- [04:57] could boost productivity from 20 % to
- [05:00] 40% in many Industries AI agents work
- [05:03] 24/7 they handle tasks such as
- [05:05] scheduling data analysis and customer
- [05:08] inquiries freeing up human resources for
- [05:10] more strategic roles another reason is
- [05:13] enhanced personalization kind of spoke
- [05:14] about this earlier and Harvard Business
- [05:17] Review really really did a good study on
- [05:19] this they showed that personalized
- [05:21] experiences powered by AI can
- [05:23] dramatically improve customer engagement
- [05:25] this is a really good example AI systems
- [05:28] that product that recommend products
- [05:30] based on your previous Behavior can
- [05:31] significantly increase customer
- [05:34] satisfaction and drive sales and I'm
- [05:36] sure you've been there before another
- [05:37] way is innovative problem solving let's
- [05:39] talk about Healthcare AI agents are now
- [05:42] analyzing medical images and assisting
- [05:44] with early diagnoses MIT tech review
- [05:47] recently showcased AI tools that can
- [05:49] help detect conditions like cancer at
- [05:51] early stages supporting Physicians with
- [05:53] more accurate data I hope when you're
- [05:55] listening to some of these findings
- [05:56] anyways they confirm that these AI
- [05:58] agents aren't just these futuristic
- [06:00] Concepts they're here and they're
- [06:01] transforming tools driving efficiency
- [06:03] personalization and Innovation so okay
- [06:07] here is another thing I wanted to
- [06:08] understand is how AI agents work from
- [06:10] basic to Advanced so let's walk through
- [06:12] this is what really got nailed at home
- [06:15] for me let's walk through a typical flow
- [06:17] of an AI agent in action let's go
- [06:19] through a basic flow so kind of old
- [06:21] school rule-based approach if you will
- [06:23] and then let's go through an AI agent
- [06:26] approach today so the basic flow starts
- [06:28] with a trigger or initiation a customer
- [06:30] visits a website and clicks on the chat
- [06:32] icon then we have input processing the
- [06:34] chat bot receives a greeting and looks
- [06:36] for keywords like support or billing
- [06:38] next up is decision-making based on the
- [06:41] predefined rules the chatbot identifies
- [06:43] the issue for example selects a scripted
- [06:46] response and then we have response
- [06:48] generation the chatbot then replies and
- [06:51] says something like I see you're having
- [06:53] billing issues can you provide your
- [06:54] account the conversation follows a fixed
- [06:57] path if the customer deviates the system
- [06:59] might struggle or escalate to a human
- [07:01] agent and that is where Advanced AI
- [07:03] Agents come in where I think they're so
- [07:05] fascinating anyways and this is a small
- [07:07] example remember we're just talking
- [07:08] about customer support but when you
- [07:10] think of this on a larger scale helping
- [07:12] you code helping make decisions it's
- [07:13] pretty wild so first we start with
- [07:15] trigger initiation again a customer
- [07:16] starts the conversation via the chat
- [07:18] interface then we have input and
- [07:20] processing so the AI agent then uses
- [07:23] Advanced natural language processing to
- [07:25] understand not just key words but also
- [07:28] context sentiment and intent it can
- [07:31] detect if the customer is frustrated or
- [07:33] confused which is pretty cool then we
- [07:35] have Dynamic decision- making rather
- [07:37] than following a fixed script which we
- [07:39] just spoke about the rule-based uh agent
- [07:41] would follow this agent dynamically
- [07:43] decides the next steps it may greet the
- [07:45] customer ask clarifying questions and
- [07:48] then analyze historical interaction data
- [07:50] to predict the issue accurately lastly
- [07:53] we have response generation the AI agent
- [07:56] then generates a personalized response
- [07:57] that is unique or personalized
- [08:00] such as I noticed you have a billing
- [08:02] issue it appears you might have been
- [08:04] charged twice is this correct so this
- [08:06] response is based on learned patterns
- [08:08] and user history then we have learning
- [08:10] and adaptation after each interaction
- [08:12] the system isn't done there it collects
- [08:14] feedback either via direct ratings or by
- [08:17] measuring resolution success and uses
- [08:20] this data to redefine or refine its
- [08:22] future responses and then we have one
- [08:23] more we're almost there system
- [08:25] integration the advanced agent might
- [08:27] also integrate with CRM systems or
- [08:29] databases to retrieve detailed customer
- [08:32] histories enabling even more tailored
- [08:34] interactions so you can see there's a
- [08:35] lot more steps in this one to make it
- [08:37] really personalized modern AI agents
- [08:39] enhance the rule-based Flow by
- [08:41] incorporating context continuous
- [08:44] learning and realtime integration which
- [08:46] no surprise results in a more effective
- [08:48] and personalized user experience okay
- [08:50] but then brings up one more question
- [08:52] which is how does this differ from past
- [08:54] AI systems like what makes it so special
- [08:56] I need to I need to really understand
- [08:58] that now let's see what exactly makes
- [09:00] today's AI agent so revolutionary one is
- [09:02] static versus dynamic system so in the
- [09:05] past static rulebase systems as we spoke
- [09:07] about early AI was predominantly
- [09:08] rule-based with fixed scripts covered
- [09:10] this throughout the video so it should
- [09:12] be hammered in pretty good now these
- [09:14] systems could only handle inputs that
- [09:16] match predefined patterns and couldn't
- [09:18] adapt without manual updates today we
- [09:21] have Dynamic adaptive systems so modern
- [09:23] agents combine rule-based logic with
- [09:26] machine learning as I mentioned earlier
- [09:28] they use NLP natural language processing
- [09:30] for contextual understanding and adapt
- [09:33] their responses over time by learning
- [09:35] new from new data and this approach
- [09:37] allows them to handle a broader range of
- [09:39] scenarios and continue to improve number
- [09:41] two is limited versus personalized
- [09:43] interactions so in the past obviously it
- [09:45] was very limited traditional systems
- [09:47] offered more of a one-size fits-all
- [09:50] response with no regard for individuals
- [09:52] and their data they couldn't store user
- [09:55] history or provide personalized
- [09:57] experiences today obviously are very
- [09:59] personalized current AI agents tailor
- [10:01] interactions based on user data and past
- [10:04] behavior and this personalization means
- [10:06] that every user can receive a more
- [10:08] relevant and engaging experience which
- [10:10] is similar to the personalization
- [10:13] recommendations that we kind of spoke
- [10:14] about earlier on whether it's through
- [10:16] chatbots or systems like Netflix or even
- [10:19] Spotify all right let's talk about
- [10:21] building your own AI agent this is
- [10:22] something that whether you're technical
- [10:24] or not you should do and just as a side
- [10:26] note I'm going to share with you kind of
- [10:27] a step-by-step approach but after after
- [10:29] this I will share with you some courses
- [10:30] that can help guide you so if you're not
- [10:32] super technical you can still follow
- [10:34] along first is you need to Define your
- [10:35] objective figure out the problem decide
- [10:37] what problem you want your AI agent to
- [10:39] solve for example do you want it to
- [10:41] answer customer questions or recommended
- [10:43] products or maybe you want it to code
- [10:46] certain parts of your code for you next
- [10:48] you need to choose the right tools so
- [10:50] programming Basics 101 let's get into it
- [10:52] many developers use obviously python it
- [10:55] has so many tools modules libraries that
- [10:57] can be associated with it that's my
- [10:59] faite language there are special
- [11:01] libraries too such as hugging faces
- [11:02] Transformers that help the AI understand
- [11:05] and work with the human language there's
- [11:07] also some no code options so if you're
- [11:09] not comfortable with coding you can use
- [11:11] user-friendly platforms like Google's
- [11:13] dialogue flow IBM's Watson assistant to
- [11:16] build your agent which is pretty fun too
- [11:17] leave in the comments if you want us to
- [11:19] build an AI agent number three is
- [11:21] designing your own system so you have to
- [11:22] break it down think of it as your
- [11:24] project and it has different parts to it
- [11:26] so input how the AI receives information
- [11:29] like text or speech processing how the
- [11:32] AI makes sense of that information and
- [11:35] then decision- making how it decides
- [11:37] what to do then the last step of course
- [11:39] is output how does it respond you also
- [11:42] need to plan your data flow plan how you
- [11:44] will collect and prepare the information
- [11:46] the AI needs clean and organized data
- [11:49] works better obviously with the AI which
- [11:51] brings us to step four collect and
- [11:53] prepare data and one just a little tip
- [11:55] if you're not super technical or nearer
- [11:57] to the space look for data sets in
- [11:58] places like k
- [12:00] uh that's where I always find my data
- [12:01] stats and there's so many options there
- [12:03] that can help match your objective then
- [12:05] step five is build and train your model
- [12:07] so you have to pick the right method
- [12:08] choose an approach or algorithm that
- [12:10] fits to what you're trying to do and
- [12:12] there are simple methods for basic tasks
- [12:14] and more complex ones for more advanced
- [12:16] tasks okay there are a ton more steps in
- [12:19] the nitty-gritty of it if you will I'm
- [12:21] going to share with you some courses up
- [12:22] here that I really love uh for building
- [12:25] your AI agent but also understanding how
- [12:27] this works I mean I hope when you leave
- [12:28] this video you feel like you really are
- [12:31] prepared to explain what ai ai agents
- [12:33] are and even how to build your own even
- [12:36] if you're a non-technical person I think
- [12:38] it's important to understand the steps
- [12:40] taken to building one but these courses
- [12:42] I mentioned are really great especially
- [12:44] for learning more and building your own
- [12:46] and once again I think even if you're
- [12:48] not looking to become an AI engineer
- [12:50] just learning how to build some of these
- [12:51] things really offers a great way to feel
- [12:54] comfortable with talking about these
- [12:55] topics and and understand what they're
- [12:57] capable of so let me know in the
- [12:59] comments if for the first AI agent we
- [13:01] build together should it be one that has
- [13:03] coding involved with python should it be
- [13:05] a no code AI agent we build leave in the
- [13:07] comments and I'll I'll I'll do whatever
- [13:10] video uh people vote on the most I just
- [13:13] want to leave you with some closing
- [13:14] thoughts so AI as we know is
- [13:16] transforming our daily lives and AI
- [13:19] agents are a really big part of that
- [13:21] next step and what it means to have
- [13:23] these as we mentioned at the beginning
- [13:25] of this video These assistance that can
- [13:27] really help us with our daily lives
- [13:29] lives with our coding our emails our
- [13:31] workflows and while they're still
- [13:33] relatively new as far as what's
- [13:36] available for us to and users to use
- [13:38] we're going to see that explode this
- [13:39] year so having an understanding of them
- [13:41] are super important I hope this video
- [13:43] has provided you both with inspiration
- [13:45] maybe to build your own and maybe if
- [13:47] you're interested in growing growing
- [13:49] your career in AI you can do so or if
- [13:51] you're on the business side just
- [13:53] understanding what it is make sure to
- [13:54] subscribe for more videos that are
- [13:55] backed by research real world
- [13:57] applications covering topics such as AI
- [13:59] coding and future Tech in general I
- [14:01] think it's the only way to stay up toate
- [14:03] and prepared is by taking a few minutes
- [14:06] listening to some of these videos and
- [14:09] understanding it more and just staying
- [14:10] curious make sure to hit that Subs I
- [14:12] just said that okay no more coffee for
- [14:14] me today thank you all for watching I'll
- [14:15] see you soon
