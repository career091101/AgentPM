- [00:00] You can now let AI control your entire
- [00:02] computer. What I'm about to show you is
- [00:04] not only the future of AI, but what I
- [00:06] think is the future of computing.
- [00:08] Anthropic just gave me exclusive early
- [00:10] access to Claude for Chrome, their AI
- [00:13] agent that controls your computer. You
- [00:15] give the agent a prompt, it does
- [00:17] whatever you want in your browser. This
- [00:19] might be the most powerful AI tool yet.
- [00:21] What I'm about to show you in this video
- [00:23] is two awesome use cases you can do with
- [00:25] Claude for Chrome. And then I'm going to
- [00:27] compare it to other AI browser use
- [00:29] agents like Perplexity Comet to let you
- [00:31] know which one's the best and which one
- [00:32] you should invest in. If your mind's not
- [00:34] blown by the end of this video, you're
- [00:36] insane. Let's get into it. So, what
- [00:38] you're looking at here on the right hand
- [00:40] side is Claude for Chrome. It's their
- [00:42] extension for Google Chrome, right? So,
- [00:44] it's an AI agent that's actually an
- [00:46] extension in Google Chrome that controls
- [00:48] your entire browser. Over on the left
- [00:50] hand side is my email inbox. So, I pray
- [00:53] to God nothing embarrassing is going to
- [00:54] show during this video. What I'm going
- [00:56] to do is give Claude for Chrome some
- [00:58] commands to do in my email inbox that
- [01:01] will save me tons of time that I think a
- [01:03] lot of people do when they'll get their
- [01:04] hands on this technology. Basically, the
- [01:06] way this works is Claude has control of
- [01:08] your browser and can do anything it
- [01:09] wants in there. It can type, it can
- [01:11] click on things, it can send emails.
- [01:13] Anything you can do in your browser,
- [01:14] Claude can do as well. So, let's start
- [01:16] giving it commands that it'll perform in
- [01:18] my browser for me. So, if you're
- [01:20] anything like me, you subscribe to every
- [01:21] single AI newsletter you see. So, I have
- [01:24] thousands of newsletters that come to me
- [01:25] on a daily basis. So, what I'm going to
- [01:27] do is I'm going to have Claude for
- [01:28] Chrome go through my email inbox, find
- [01:31] me all the newsletters, read through all
- [01:33] the newsletters, summarize them, and
- [01:35] then email me that summary. So, instead
- [01:37] of me having to go and read a thousand
- [01:39] newsletters every single morning,
- [01:40] instead, I'm going to read one summary
- [01:42] email that Claude will be sending me
- [01:44] that has a rundown of all of those
- [01:46] newsletters. So, it saves me a ton of
- [01:48] time so I don't have to read a thousand
- [01:49] different newsletters. So, here's the
- [01:51] prompt. Search my inbox for any
- [01:52] newsletters. then email me a summary of
- [01:54] those newsletters with a title and
- [01:56] description of the newsletters. And I'm
- [01:58] going to hit enter. And what you're
- [01:59] going to see here is Claude is going to
- [02:01] take control of my computer. So it says,
- [02:03] "I'll help you search your inbox for
- [02:04] newsletters and email a summary to you.
- [02:06] Let me take a screenshot to see the
- [02:08] current state of your browser. Then
- [02:09] navigate to email inbox." Okay, so it's
- [02:12] screenshotted my browser to see what it
- [02:14] looks like. It's now searching through
- [02:16] my inbox for newsletter or mailing list.
- [02:19] It hit enter. It now has a rundown of
- [02:23] all the newsletters in my inbox. Uh, so
- [02:25] it clicked and you can see all the
- [02:27] commands it's doing over here on the
- [02:28] right hand side. Right? So it clicked,
- [02:30] it typed newsletter or unsubscribe or
- [02:32] something else. It hit return. It's
- [02:34] waiting three seconds. It's taking a
- [02:36] screenshot now so that it can see
- [02:37] everything in my inbox. Right? That's
- [02:39] how it sees. It takes screenshots. So
- [02:40] everything's done through screenshots.
- [02:42] Perfect. I can see the search results.
- [02:44] So it sees it sees various newsletters.
- [02:46] It can see the rundown. Open AAI,
- [02:47] Substack, uh, Tech Brew, A16Z, Speedrun,
- [02:52] Yahoo, Fantasy, Fantasy Football Star
- [02:54] next week. Promise you I'm going to win.
- [02:56] Uh, snacks. Okay, so now it's going
- [02:57] down. It's scrolling down my
- [02:59] newsletters. And now it's going through
- [03:00] and reading all of those newsletters.
- [03:02] Perfect. I now have a comprehensive view
- [03:04] of the newsletters. Let me scroll down a
- [03:05] bit to make sure I capture all the
- [03:07] newsletters before composing the summary
- [03:08] email. Excellent. Now I have a
- [03:10] comprehensive list of email newsletters.
- [03:13] I can see. Okay, so now look at this. It
- [03:14] opens up the new message, right? So, it
- [03:17] clicked it opened up the compose email.
- [03:19] It's taking a screenshot to see where
- [03:21] the email composer is. All right. Looks
- [03:23] like it put in the subject line
- [03:25] newsletter summary from your inbox. It's
- [03:27] taking a screenshot to make sure it did
- [03:28] the right thing here. I love that. All
- [03:30] right. Let me take a screenshot to
- [03:31] confirm the subject was entered
- [03:33] correctly. All right. It's verifying its
- [03:34] work to make sure it wrote the subject
- [03:36] in there correctly, which I like. All
- [03:37] right, perfect. I can see the subject
- [03:39] newsletter summary from your inbox is
- [03:40] now in the subject fields. Now I need to
- [03:42] click in the email body area to compose
- [03:44] the newsletter summary. I can see
- [03:46] there's space below the subject field
- [03:47] where I can type in the email content.
- [03:49] Okay, so clicked and now you can see
- [03:51] here it moved the cursor into the email
- [03:54] composer so that I can write the email.
- [03:56] Now let me take a screenshot to confirm
- [03:58] I'm in the email body. So it's going
- [03:59] step by step just like a human being
- [04:02] would. Right? It's clicking in each
- [04:03] area. It can see everything on the
- [04:05] browser and it's confirming through the
- [04:06] screenshot that it's doing everything
- [04:08] correctly. Basically, the AI agent's
- [04:10] eyes are the screenshots of everything
- [04:12] going on in the computer. All right.
- [04:14] Now, I'll type the newsletter summary
- [04:15] based on all the newsletters I found in
- [04:16] the search. Okay. So, now it's about to
- [04:18] type in Oh, here it is. Here's a summary
- [04:20] of the newsletters I found in your
- [04:21] inbox. So, it's going through Oh, wow.
- [04:24] It's categorizing it by the uh type of
- [04:28] the newsletter. Product and development,
- [04:29] entertainment and lifestyle, business
- [04:31] and finance, AI and technology. I love
- [04:34] that. Uh, and now let's see. Great.
- [04:36] Okay, I can see the cursor is in the
- [04:37] email body area. Now type the newsletter
- [04:39] summary. Wow. Okay, these newsletters
- [04:41] span a various categories including AI
- [04:43] technology, business, finance, product
- [04:45] development, and now it's taking a
- [04:46] screenshot to confirm the email content
- [04:48] is there. And then it is going to send
- [04:50] the email. Perfect. I can see the emails
- [04:52] composed with the email being sent to
- [04:53] me, the subject, the body, and notice
- [04:55] there was a little popup advertisement
- [04:57] Gmail had in there. So, it exited out of
- [04:59] that. It dismissed that popup. And now I
- [05:02] think what it should be doing next is
- [05:03] clicking send so it can send me the
- [05:05] email. Now, let me click. Oh, boom.
- [05:07] Clicked send. It just hit send. Let's
- [05:09] see what happens here. Let's go back to
- [05:11] my inbox. And there it is. Me summary
- [05:13] summary for your inbox. And there's the
- [05:15] email the AI agent sent to me. So, there
- [05:18] it is. Let's run down what just happened
- [05:19] here before we go into the next
- [05:21] incredible use case. Right? It went in,
- [05:23] it went through my entire inbox, it
- [05:25] found all the newsletters, it summarized
- [05:27] them for me in my email, and then sent
- [05:29] them to me. Right? Imagine if this got
- [05:31] automated. Right? The next step is
- [05:33] clearly automation for this. So imagine
- [05:35] I can give it a task every morning. Do
- [05:37] this for me. And now I don't need to
- [05:39] worry about reading all the newsletters
- [05:40] in my inbox anymore. Every morning,
- [05:42] Claude, it just goes and summarizes the
- [05:45] emails for me. That's clearly where this
- [05:47] technology is going, right? It just
- [05:49] saved me a ton of time and a ton of
- [05:51] work. I don't need to read every single
- [05:52] newsletter. Now I now have a rundown of
- [05:54] all those newsletters. The next use case
- [05:56] I'm going to show you with this Claude
- [05:57] agent is a curation of stories and
- [06:00] creating content. So, what I usually do
- [06:02] when I'm creating these YouTube videos
- [06:04] is I try to find top AI stories and then
- [06:08] turn those into scripts, but now I can
- [06:10] automate that with this Clawed agent.
- [06:12] So, what I'm going to have it do is find
- [06:14] the top AI news stories, go into Google
- [06:16] Sheets, create a new spreadsheet, put
- [06:18] those stories in there, and then come up
- [06:20] with scripts and titles for each one of
- [06:22] those stories so that I can go in and
- [06:24] maybe every day just have a list of
- [06:26] potential videos I can film. This will
- [06:28] make it so I don't have to hire writers
- [06:30] so I don't have to hire researchers. And
- [06:32] it'll also just save me a ton of time on
- [06:33] top of that. So, let's get into the
- [06:35] Claude agent. So, here's what we're
- [06:36] going to do. I'm gonna say, "Find me a
- [06:37] list of top AI news stories. Then,
- [06:39] create a new spreadsheet in Google
- [06:40] Sheets and put the news stories in the
- [06:42] spreadsheet in different rows. Then,
- [06:44] create me a YouTube script and title for
- [06:46] each news story in different columns."
- [06:47] Right? And you know, everyone watches
- [06:49] video is probably not a YouTube creator,
- [06:50] but for you, this could be things like
- [06:52] things you do at work, right? You
- [06:54] probably have to create spreadsheets at
- [06:55] work. So, you can have this do research
- [06:57] for you, maybe look through your inbox,
- [06:59] and then create those spreadsheets for
- [07:01] you. This can save you a lot of time, no
- [07:03] matter what industry you're in. So, I'm
- [07:05] going to hit enter, and I'm going to
- [07:06] have the Clawed agent get to work. I'll
- [07:08] help you find the top AI news stories,
- [07:10] create a Google Sheet spreadsheet with
- [07:11] them, and add YouTube script content.
- [07:14] Let me start by searching for recent AI
- [07:16] news. So, it's in Google. It's going to
- [07:18] search for AI news inside Google. Again,
- [07:20] I'm not touching anything. I'm not
- [07:22] typing anything. It's searching top AI
- [07:24] news stories 2025. Uh so it has and what
- [07:27] you can see here on the right hand side
- [07:29] is everything that how the so what you
- [07:31] can see here on the right hand side is
- [07:32] how the clawed agent is thinking again.
- [07:34] So it searched for AI news. It changed
- [07:37] the input. It pressed return. It waited.
- [07:39] It's reading the page. I can see the
- [07:41] results for the AI news. Let me click on
- [07:42] the news tab to get the current AI. So
- [07:45] it knew to go to the news tab to get the
- [07:47] latest news. I'm in London right now. So
- [07:49] it's showing all the different stories
- [07:50] of UK AI news and trends. That's fine.
- [07:53] For the record, it always seems like the
- [07:54] biggest news stories come out while I'm
- [07:56] on the road, while I'm on vacation. So,
- [07:57] of course, I had to figure out a way to
- [07:58] film this in a hotel. But anyway,
- [08:00] doesn't matter. Okay, so now went into
- [08:01] Google Sheets. It created a new
- [08:03] spreadsheet. I can see that there's a
- [08:04] blank spreadsheet. Let me click on the
- [08:06] blank spreadsheet template to create a
- [08:07] new one. Okay, so now it's in there.
- [08:09] Perfect. I now have a new Google Sheet
- [08:10] document open. I can see the spreadsheet
- [08:12] interface in the cell selected. I will
- [08:14] start with the title in cell A1. Okay,
- [08:16] so now it's creating the columns for us.
- [08:18] So the news title, let me click directly
- [08:20] on the main spreadsheet area to select
- [08:22] the cell A1. All right, so it's in
- [08:23] there. It just typed in news title. All
- [08:25] right, so it's creating those columns
- [08:26] for us. I imagine'll have the story in
- [08:29] the next. So hit tab to move down. All
- [08:30] right, so it put source in B1. It's
- [08:32] moving over to C1. All right, it just
- [08:35] put date in C1. Okay, I imagine it's
- [08:37] going to do the YouTube script and the
- [08:39] YouTube title in D1 and E1, I would
- [08:41] guess. It's taking a screenshot after
- [08:43] every change it makes to make sure it's
- [08:44] doing it correct, I assume. All right,
- [08:46] now let me add the next header for
- [08:48] YouTube title in D1. Okay, so it's
- [08:50] creating the headers one by one, which
- [08:51] is great. And as this goes, all right,
- [08:53] so now I created the next column, which
- [08:55] is YouTube script. Okay, now I have all
- [08:57] my headers set up. Let me start adding
- [08:59] the AI news stories. I'll begin with the
- [09:01] first news story in row two. Let me
- [09:03] click on cell A2. Man, I had to do so
- [09:07] much monotonous spreadsheet work in my
- [09:09] job before. This would have saved me so
- [09:11] much time. This is going to make the
- [09:13] office life so much easier for a lot of
- [09:16] people. Imagine this is connected to
- [09:18] your cloud memories and it knows
- [09:19] everything about you. So, it can
- [09:20] customize what it's doing in your
- [09:22] browser based on what it knows about
- [09:23] you. There's so much potential here.
- [09:25] It's crazy. I feel like I'm in day one
- [09:27] of this like revolutionary change. All
- [09:28] right, so it put the news title in cell
- [09:30] A2. It's moving over to the source. I'm
- [09:33] excited to see what it does for the
- [09:34] YouTube title and script. So now we're
- [09:36] not only having it do kind of the hard
- [09:39] work of finding stories, we also have it
- [09:40] do creative work, which is coming up
- [09:42] with the YouTube scripts and titles. So
- [09:44] I'm excited to see how that turns out.
- [09:45] So it's putting the source in. It's
- [09:47] taking screenshots every step of the way
- [09:48] to ensure it's doing the right work
- [09:50] here. I like that. Okay, it moved to the
- [09:52] wrong cell. Now it's taking a
- [09:54] screenshot. I'm interested to see if
- [09:55] it's going to recognize it did the wrong
- [09:57] thing here. Good. The source is now
- [09:58] saved. Now I'm in Okay, so yep, it fixed
- [10:00] the cell. It moved over to the right
- [10:01] cell. Now it's putting in the date. All
- [10:03] right, so here's where it gets
- [10:04] interesting. Let's see what it Okay.
- [10:05] Yep. Came up with the YouTube title AI
- [10:07] security crisis. 63% of UK predict major
- [10:10] cyber attacks in 2025. All right. Is
- [10:12] that exactly an AI story I'm going to
- [10:14] make a YouTube script out of? Probably
- [10:16] not, but let's see how it does with the
- [10:17] actual script itself. All right. It's in
- [10:19] the script cell. Let's see how it does
- [10:22] here. All right. Perfect. I'm in cell
- [10:23] E2. Let me create a YouTube script for
- [10:25] the story. And boom. There's the script.
- [10:26] Let me I'm going to hit stop here. Let's
- [10:28] see what we got so far. Intro. Hey AI
- [10:30] enthusiasts. Shocking news from the
- [10:32] cyber security world. 63% of C CISOs
- [10:35] expect major cyber attacks in 2025 with
- [10:37] AI both creating new threats and
- [10:38] offering solutions. All right, so it
- [10:40] gives me kind of a light script. This is
- [10:42] the exact script I'm probably going to
- [10:43] use. No, but it's a starting spot,
- [10:46] right? And now imagine I just have this
- [10:47] running 247 looking for AI news stories,
- [10:50] putting them into spreadsheets for me,
- [10:52] just having me prepared. You can see how
- [10:54] this can now start replacing people and
- [10:56] making it so one-person businesses like
- [10:58] me can get a lot done instead of having
- [11:01] to go do hours of research every day,
- [11:03] hours of writing scripts, hours of
- [11:05] coming up with titles, I can save that
- [11:07] with this AI agent. And the same goes
- [11:08] for you depending on what you're doing.
- [11:10] Any kind of manual work you do on
- [11:12] computers now can be taken care of with
- [11:15] this clawed agent. It is super super
- [11:17] powerful. Now, is this the first browser
- [11:19] use agent? No, there isn't. Probably the
- [11:22] most popular one at the moment is
- [11:24] Perplexity Comet. But the thing with
- [11:26] Perplexity Comet is this and it's the
- [11:28] concern I had at the beginning is it is
- [11:30] an entirely new browser, right?
- [11:32] Perplexity basically forked Google
- [11:34] Chrome and built their entire own
- [11:37] browser just to house an AI agent. What
- [11:39] I like about Claude is is they built
- [11:41] this to be an extension for Chrome. So
- [11:44] you don't need to use a new browser to
- [11:46] use this AI agent. I think 99% of people
- [11:49] have no interest in switching browsers
- [11:51] and maybe they'll play around Perplexity
- [11:53] comment for a couple minutes and then
- [11:55] they'll come back to Chrome and never go
- [11:56] back. Right, Claude? They're not trying
- [11:58] to force you into new applications. They
- [12:01] just build software for the things
- [12:02] you're currently using. They try to make
- [12:04] things as convenient as possible.
- [12:06] Instead of making you use an entirely
- [12:08] new development environment to use
- [12:10] clawed code, they just did it so you can
- [12:11] use it in your terminal and you can open
- [12:13] up the terminal and cursor so you can
- [12:15] code where you've always been. Instead
- [12:16] of having to make you download a new
- [12:18] browser to use their AI agent, they just
- [12:21] have it as an extension for the browser
- [12:22] you're already using. I love this
- [12:24] mindset from Anthropic to make it as
- [12:27] easy for you and as natural for you to
- [12:29] use their AI tools and enhance your
- [12:31] current workflows already instead of
- [12:33] forcing you into new workflow. This is
- [12:35] really powerful and almost every use
- [12:37] case I've given it so far, it's been
- [12:38] able to do pretty much flawlessly. The
- [12:41] one use case it actually failed at was I
- [12:43] I tried to have it edit my thumbnail
- [12:46] inside Canva. I won't show it to you
- [12:48] because it took forever to get to a
- [12:49] really bad result, but it just could not
- [12:52] figure out how to like edit the text,
- [12:54] make the text look good. It didn't have
- [12:56] much good taste when it came to visual
- [12:58] design. So, the AI agents aren't there
- [13:01] yet when it comes to visual design, but
- [13:03] for more of the monotonous work for
- [13:05] curating information, for summarizing,
- [13:07] putting information together, and
- [13:09] putting together spreadsheets and
- [13:10] documents and emails, it is really,
- [13:13] really impressive. It's in exclusive
- [13:15] early access now. If you want to be a
- [13:17] part of it, make sure to sign up on
- [13:19] their website for the wait list. They
- [13:20] are slowly rolling it out now. I've
- [13:22] enjoyed it so much and I cannot wait to
- [13:24] see where it goes from here. I'm going
- [13:26] to actually run an experiment. And I
- [13:27] think I'm going to buy a computer
- [13:29] dedicated to this and just have it run
- [13:31] 24/7 on the computer doing different
- [13:33] things in my browser, just doing work
- [13:35] for me. I'll create a follow-up video on
- [13:37] that. So, make sure to hit subscribe and
- [13:38] turn on notifications to get that video
- [13:40] when it comes out. I really appreciate
- [13:42] you watching the video. Leave a like if
- [13:43] you enjoyed it or learn anything at all.
- [13:45] and I'll see you in the next video.
