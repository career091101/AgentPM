- [00:00] Here's something that took me personally
- [00:02] way out of my comfort zone. My brother
- [00:05] and his wife are super busy with their
- [00:07] new baby, and my 8-year-old nephew's
- [00:10] birthday party is coming right up. Why
- [00:12] don't I organize the party? And so, of
- [00:14] course, I start by searching for ideas.
- [00:17] What's a good theme? Do we need a venue?
- [00:19] How do I even find one? Should we dress
- [00:21] up? Are clowns cool, or are they a
- [00:24] little bit
- [00:25] weird? Hey,
- [00:27] co-pilot, where do I begin?
- [00:30] Don't worry, I got you. I'd recommend
- [00:32] picking a theme first. Copilot just cuts
- [00:36] right through the chaos and gets to the
- [00:37] heart of what you need. It's grounded in
- [00:39] web links, so you can always reliably
- [00:41] look things up whenever you want. Bang.
- [00:43] Dinosaurs. Okay, excellent theme. That's
- [00:46] a good start. So, when I'm looking for a
- [00:48] venue, it makes comparing those options
- [00:50] super easy. Hey co-pilot, for tomorrow's
- [00:53] commute, can you put together a 15minute
- [00:56] podcast with some dinosaur facts that I
- [00:59] can remember so I can show up like one
- [01:00] of those cool uncles at the birthday
- [01:02] party?
- [01:04] You got it, Mustafa. I'll get that ready
- [01:06] for you right away. Nice. Okay, let's
- [01:08] have a listen. Morning. Welcome to your
- [01:11] personal podcast about dinosaurs. Here
- [01:14] are some cool facts for your nephew's
- [01:16] birthday party. What about the name
- [01:18] Velociraptor? It means speedy thief.
- [01:21] Kids will love that one. Learning about
- [01:23] anything has never felt so fun and so
- [01:26] easygoing. Now I need to start buying
- [01:28] decorations, get the party gear in, and
- [01:31] most importantly of all, I need a
- [01:33] present. C-Pilot makes shopping easier
- [01:35] and much less stressful for everything
- [01:37] from a new jacket to a perfect toy. I
- [01:41] think of it as like your personal
- [01:42] concierge. As you can see, Copilot
- [01:45] searches through our real-time catalog
- [01:46] of trusted merchants to find just the
- [01:49] right item. In this case, a robot
- [01:52] dinosaur, and it's on sale. Perfect.
- [01:55] Now, you can actually purchase in app
- [01:57] from some of the world's biggest and
- [01:59] most trusted
- [02:00] retailers. And with our new mobile app,
- [02:03] Copilot can actually see what you see
- [02:06] and talk to you about it in real time.
- [02:09] Hey, Copilot, could you help me group
- [02:11] these by, say, era?
- [02:15] Looks like you're working with some
- [02:17] dinosaurs. Most of these are from the
- [02:19] Mesazoic era, which is divided into
- [02:22] three periods. Copilot can see things
- [02:25] changing and react in real time,
- [02:27] navigating the world with you. You don't
- [02:29] need to explain what you're looking at
- [02:31] or what you're trying to do. Copilot
- [02:33] just gets it. And so whether you're in
- [02:35] the browser or now on your phone,
- [02:37] Copilot Vision is the most natural
- [02:39] interaction imaginable.
