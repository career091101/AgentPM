- [00:00] Today you're going to learn about a
- [00:01] workflow that I personally use when
- [00:03] building out apps that no one's going to
- [00:04] talk about. And the reason no one's
- [00:05] going to talk about it is because of the
- [00:06] fact that I created the workflow and I
- [00:08] use the workflow. And the workflow's
- [00:10] name is very simple, main, and grunty.
- [00:12] Let's jump in. So, if you didn't know or
- [00:14] you living under a rock right now,
- [00:16] agents can run in parallel. What I mean
- [00:18] by that is that we can set up workflows
- [00:20] where we have multiple agents working on
- [00:23] your application at once. When you're in
- [00:25] the beginning stages of creating out an
- [00:26] app, this can get a lot of fun, right?
- [00:28] We could run five or six agents running
- [00:30] in parallel at the exact same time.
- [00:32] Build out a bunch of cool stuff such as
- [00:33] like, yo, I got a new app. Build out the
- [00:35] landing page. Build out the login page.
- [00:37] Build out the signup page. All of this.
- [00:39] But at a certain point, after this
- [00:41] massive like we have five, six agents
- [00:43] running at the same time. At a certain
- [00:44] point, this becomes ineffective. And the
- [00:45] reason this becomes ineffective is
- [00:47] because of the fact that as you add more
- [00:48] files, as you add more code, things get
- [00:50] more complex. So once we transition from
- [00:52] the build build suggestions phase, if
- [00:54] you know if you know, we got to do a
- [00:55] different method. And the method I
- [00:57] personally like is what I like to call
- [00:59] main and grunty. I used to call it mane
- [01:01] and grunt. And then over on my ex,
- [01:02] people were like, "No, Corbin, don't
- [01:03] call it grunt. Call it grunty. We're
- [01:05] calling it grunty." Also, if you want to
- [01:06] follow me on X, description down below,
- [01:07] second link. So, let me show you this
- [01:08] method. How do we cook up and start this
- [01:09] method? Well, first off, we got to make
- [01:11] sure that the agent knows what's
- [01:12] incurring. So, what I like to do, and
- [01:14] you can start doing this as well, is I
- [01:15] will choose a higher level model for
- [01:17] main. And what I'm going to do is this.
- [01:19] I'm just going to use the simple prompt
- [01:20] here of read my entire repo and
- [01:21] understand my app. I'm going to switch
- [01:22] to ask and shoot it off. I'm going to
- [01:24] copy this prompt though. We shoot it
- [01:25] off. Also, make sure that you have
- [01:26] browser mode on. Google Chrome browser
- [01:29] tab. Put on browser tab. Make sure you
- [01:30] have the application running. Hit new
- [01:32] agent here. I'm going to put the exact
- [01:33] same command, but we can switch to
- [01:34] something like auto with this. Hit enter
- [01:36] again. So now we have two different
- [01:39] chats here. We got this first one and we
- [01:41] got the second one. Some of youall
- [01:42] already know where this is probably
- [01:43] going, but let's do it. First one here,
- [01:45] we have a higher level model. Therefore,
- [01:46] we are going to rename this to main.
- [01:49] Enter. Nice. Second one, we have auto.
- [01:52] So we use lower level models, but we
- [01:54] want to expediate code workflows. So
- [01:55] we're going to rename this to grunty. We
- [01:57] got main and grunty here. So what do we
- [01:59] do, Corbin? Maine is where we're going
- [02:01] to offshoot a reasoning task or task
- [02:03] that I know is going to take a lot more
- [02:05] time to complete. Grunty is where we do
- [02:08] the very fast stuff. The type of stuff
- [02:09] that we could have coded ourselves, but
- [02:11] why code when we can just tell it what
- [02:13] to do now type of task. So let's do an
- [02:14] example of this. Each chat has been
- [02:16] pre-loaded to understand my repo. Now,
- [02:18] if you were specifically working on a
- [02:20] very specific page, for example, the
- [02:22] value page of an app. So, this right
- [02:23] here, this is a this is thumbnail.com,
- [02:25] best thumbnail editor in the world. If I
- [02:27] was working on this specific page and
- [02:28] I'm about to shoot off main, instead of
- [02:30] having it having a general idea of the
- [02:32] entire app, I don't really care. I
- [02:33] wanted to have a very specific idea of
- [02:35] everything and all the code that's
- [02:36] incurring on this page, my value point.
- [02:39] So one way we can do this to make it
- [02:40] very easy in our lives is if you've set
- [02:42] up routing studios SSS little sandbox
- [02:46] like this situation I can copy this and
- [02:47] I can be like okay understand all the
- [02:49] code rendered on this page hit enter
- [02:51] here and then what this is going to do
- [02:52] is going to see all the components
- [02:53] rendered here and just understand the
- [02:55] code just get context and for anyone
- [02:57] that's wondering or just found my
- [02:58] channel and they're like what is thumbio
- [02:59] how did you build this Corbin oh you're
- [03:01] in luck there's a whole playlist
- [03:02] dedicated to this so check it out I
- [03:04] might leave in the description down
- [03:04] below we're talking 10 12 episodes by
- [03:06] the end of it it's hour long episodes I
- [03:08] show you how to genuinely build out an
- [03:09] app with zero coding experience. So once
- [03:11] I would do something like that, I
- [03:12] already know I put a big task here. So
- [03:14] here's what I'll do next. All right, so
- [03:15] we have a cool little folder system. I'm
- [03:17] able to, you know, drag my amazing image
- [03:19] here and I can create more projects.
- [03:21] This is all cool. But maybe with this
- [03:22] folder system, I'm like, you know what?
- [03:24] I want to add a little bit of little bit
- [03:25] of color. I want to make it fun. So
- [03:27] right now, my studio sandbox, I come
- [03:28] over here. I'm like, oh, I can change
- [03:29] the color palette. Yeah. Oh, change
- [03:31] lead. Nice. I want to change the color
- [03:33] of my folder. So to shoot off a task
- [03:34] like this, what you can do is
- [03:36] screenshot, give context. I put in the
- [03:38] chat here and do this. I'm going to do
- [03:39] this in a very vibe cody way. You see my
- [03:40] folder icon. I want it so that the user
- [03:42] can click the icon and change the color
- [03:43] of the folder. Hit enter. I gave image
- [03:45] context. I gave specifically the action
- [03:46] I want to incur. I am in ask mode. I'm
- [03:48] not in agent mode. And first let's just
- [03:50] come to common ground. Me and main. Now
- [03:52] what can happen here is as it's getting
- [03:53] context is I can come over to Grunty.
- [03:55] What Grunty can do is I can be looking
- [03:57] through my app while I'm waiting for
- [03:58] this to be done and I can find little
- [04:00] things. I'm just like let's change that.
- [04:01] So scrolling down here I'm like this
- [04:03] looks good. This looks good. You know
- [04:04] what? Actually, let's do this. 10 hay
- [04:06] bells equals one lead image screenshot.
- [04:08] And then I give that to Grunty and I'm
- [04:09] like, "Oh, wait, wait. Oh, Maine's
- [04:10] done." Okay, so I don't care about that
- [04:11] right now. Let's go back to Maine. And
- [04:12] this is what Maine says. It's like,
- [04:14] okay, summary. Clicking the folder icon
- [04:15] opens a color picker. Preset colors and
- [04:17] custom color input. You know what? I
- [04:19] just want preset colors. I don't want it
- [04:21] to get too complex. Just let them choose
- [04:22] a couple. Let's say six colors. So, this
- [04:24] is the planning mode. I've done another
- [04:26] video on this. You can check out on this
- [04:27] channel, but this is the planning mode
- [04:28] where we want to get on the same ground
- [04:30] of what we want to accomplish together.
- [04:31] So, once that's done, okay, we got six
- [04:33] colors. This looks good. I'll switch to
- [04:35] plan mode and be like make the plan.
- [04:36] While that's going, I jump back over to
- [04:38] Grunty and I'm like, you know what? You
- [04:39] see these numbers? Add a highlight. And
- [04:41] then what we're referencing here is 10
- [04:43] and one. Enter. Go Grunty. Go. Notice
- [04:46] with Grunty, I am just straight up in
- [04:47] agent mode because I know these are
- [04:49] extremely simple tasks that I could have
- [04:50] personally done. With Maine, I am not in
- [04:52] agent mode right away because I'm doing
- [04:54] more complex workflows. I want to create
- [04:56] plans around the workflow. And then I
- [04:57] want to hit build. Now the agent's
- [04:59] running. Now, Maine's going to take a
- [05:01] couple minutes, five, 10 minutes, maybe
- [05:03] shorter, maybe longer. But while Maine
- [05:05] is building out very complex workflows,
- [05:07] I am over here in Grunty like, "Hey, we
- [05:09] got to get going here." Now, Grunty's
- [05:10] being really dumb right now. I can't
- [05:12] edit images directly. Oh no, Grunty. So,
- [05:14] what I'm going to do is uh instead of
- [05:16] auto, we'll wait it up to sun at 4.5 and
- [05:18] say, "Try again, Grunty. I know you can
- [05:20] do it, Grunty. Maybe Grunty was a little
- [05:21] too dumb and it'll know what to do
- [05:23] then." I might have to give a little
- [05:24] more context to Grunty, but let me see.
- [05:26] Look at this. Maine's going. Maine's
- [05:27] just shooting off. Let Maine go while
- [05:29] Maine's going. You know, the application
- [05:31] might come in and out. I don't care.
- [05:32] Grunties in progress now. Grunty
- [05:34] understands what's happening. Boom.
- [05:35] Boom. Boom. Now, from here, if you're
- [05:36] more advanced, you could add more
- [05:37] Grunties. But what I suggest you do when
- [05:39] your codebase gets pretty big is I like
- [05:41] this flip-flop workflow where any
- [05:42] downtime that I have while main is
- [05:44] going, I can kind of focus with grunty
- [05:46] little like fast things. Boom, boom,
- [05:48] boom, boom. I don't have time to
- [05:49] necessarily create two mains because the
- [05:51] amount of mental capacity is you want to
- [05:53] really focus all your energy mentally
- [05:56] towards main. Grunty is more of like I
- [05:58] have downtime and instead of scrolling
- [06:00] on IG or scrolling on TikTok, you're
- [06:02] actively working and pushing your
- [06:03] project forward. So # Main and Grunty
- [06:06] made by yours truly, Corbin. Let's see
- [06:08] if this works. So Grunty is done. I'll
- [06:09] be like, "Okay, this looks amazing.
- [06:10] Grunty, what are we doing Grunty?" Let's
- [06:12] go to the homepage and let's go to the
- [06:15] landing page. Come down here. And there
- [06:17] you go. It added a nice little round
- [06:19] rectangle before it. I actually do like
- [06:21] that a lot. That's actually really nice.
- [06:22] So that looks good. I love it. I would
- [06:24] hit keep all behind me. and Grunty, you
- [06:26] are off to your next task. And then I'll
- [06:27] jump around. Coming over to Maine, I
- [06:29] would be like, "Oh, looks like Maine's
- [06:30] finished." Let's see if Maine worked.
- [06:32] Now, what you need to understand is that
- [06:34] especially when doing more complex task,
- [06:35] it might not be a one-shot go. That's
- [06:37] part of the reason why we give Maine
- [06:39] such a higher level model so we can
- [06:40] handle this logic. But if I click this,
- [06:42] it works. So, it did add the custom
- [06:43] color, but I can request it not to be
- [06:45] done. But I'm like, you know what? I
- [06:46] want pink. Make my folder pink. Apply.
- [06:48] And it's not working. So, we're going to
- [06:49] make it work. So, what I'll do is I'm
- [06:50] trying to click here. Huh, it's not
- [06:52] working. Uh when I click this, I'm just
- [06:54] not getting the ability to change the
- [06:55] color of the folder. So what I'll do is
- [06:56] I'll screenshot and then I'll be like
- [06:58] pop-up works, but when I click it is not
- [07:01] saving or changing color. Also, no
- [07:04] custom color option. Enter. And then
- [07:05] when that's going, I noticed with
- [07:07] Grunty, what I'm about to show you right
- [07:08] now, if you if you develop, you're going
- [07:09] to be like, Corbin, you could have
- [07:10] edited that. I know. Okay, I know this
- [07:12] is extremely simple, but one lead image
- [07:14] edit. I'm going to be like, you know
- [07:15] what? Let's do lead edit. We don't need
- [07:17] to add image. There's enough context.
- [07:18] This is a thumbnail platform. The user
- [07:20] doesn't need to have image edit because
- [07:21] it knows through thumbnails it's going
- [07:23] to inherently be an edit. So now look at
- [07:25] that. 10 hay bales equals one lead image
- [07:28] edit or just one lead edit. I like it.
- [07:30] Coming back over to main. It is going
- [07:31] still. So let's see. So we're back over
- [07:32] here to main. I click this folder. Click
- [07:34] this. I'm like, you know what? Let's do
- [07:36] this. Seems like it's not working still.
- [07:37] Let me do a hard reload. Sometimes you
- [07:39] want to do that on the front end. So do
- [07:40] that. Try again. Click. Doesn't seem
- [07:42] like it's working. Maybe it wants me to
- [07:44] do this. Okay. So still not working. I'm
- [07:46] going to open up the console log here.
- [07:48] See if any errors are occurring. And
- [07:49] look at that y'all. This is the debug
- [07:50] flow. Oh, something seems to be
- [07:52] happening. I'm just going to copy all
- [07:53] this and act like I have no clue what it
- [07:55] means. Then I'm going to paste it here
- [07:56] and hit enter. This is the workflow.
- [07:58] When you tackle bigger task, use main.
- [08:00] Smaller task, you hit grunty. Let's see
- [08:01] main work. So, after I let the agent go
- [08:04] off for a little bit here, I went ahead
- [08:05] and fixed it. Over here, select this
- [08:07] color. Nice. This color. Nice. Maybe I
- [08:11] want pink. Pink. Now, one thing I want
- [08:12] to point out is that if you're running
- [08:14] into an error or there seems to be an
- [08:15] issue where you are attacking something
- [08:18] in the main agent for too long, switch
- [08:20] the model. I actually had to do that.
- [08:22] For some reason, composer one was just
- [08:23] cooking itself. So, I switched to GBT
- [08:25] Codex High and it was able to get it
- [08:27] done in the first shot. There you go.
- [08:29] There's Maine and Grunty. The best
- [08:30] method ever created to optimize your
- [08:32] time when developing in this way. So, as
- [08:34] you already know with these style
- [08:35] videos, make sure you leave a like. It's
- [08:36] completely free. I'll see you in the
- [08:38] next Main Grunty. Main Grunty. Oh, it's
- [08:40] Maine. It's grunty backup camera. It's
- [08:43] main grunty man. Grunty man grunty type
- [08:46] of video.
