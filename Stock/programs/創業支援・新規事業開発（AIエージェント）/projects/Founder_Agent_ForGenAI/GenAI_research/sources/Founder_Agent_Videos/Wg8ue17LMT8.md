- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] I am super excited to announce our new
- [00:07] Udemy course that is nothing but
- [00:09] building AI agents and agentic AI
- [00:11] systems with the help of Microsoft
- [00:14] Autogen. Now if you don't know Microsoft
- [00:17] Autogen is also one of the most popular
- [00:19] framework that will be specifically used
- [00:22] to develop agentic AI applications.
- [00:24] uh now in the world of era wherein
- [00:27] everybody's focusing on building AI
- [00:28] agents in agentic AI system it is
- [00:31] important that we have knowledge with
- [00:32] respect to multiple frameworks and that
- [00:34] is the reason me and my entire team are
- [00:37] working really really hard to come up
- [00:39] with some amazing courses in an
- [00:41] affordable way wherein we cover all the
- [00:43] specific frameworks in much more in
- [00:45] depth I've already uploaded one course
- [00:47] with respect to langraph now we are
- [00:49] going to cover up with Microsoft autogen
- [00:52] and uh the feedback back from all the
- [00:55] specific courses has been quite amazing
- [00:57] and people are really demanding for more
- [00:59] and more different kind of use cases and
- [01:02] uh different kind of implementation
- [01:04] where we can develop agentic AI system
- [01:07] such that we take it into the production
- [01:08] level. So anybody who is specifically
- [01:10] interested into getting into generative
- [01:12] AI agentic AI then this is the course
- [01:14] definitely for you. uh in this video
- [01:17] I'll be talking more about this
- [01:18] particular courses what all things you
- [01:19] can you will be learning what are the
- [01:21] prerequisites that you actually require
- [01:23] in order to learn this and many more
- [01:25] things okay so first of all uh here in
- [01:27] this particular course uh this has been
- [01:29] collaborated with Mayank Agarwal I hope
- [01:31] everybody knows about Mayank Agarwal uh
- [01:33] he is the part of my team where we are
- [01:36] focusing on understanding what all
- [01:38] things people definitely require to get
- [01:40] into this specific industry right uh so
- [01:43] here to go ahead with right now this
- [01:45] particular course fees is only 3.99
- [01:47] rupees. Um and understand if you just
- [01:50] need to use a coupon which is called as
- [01:52] agentic01. Uh as I said the course price
- [01:56] is very very minimal less than a
- [01:58] Starbucks coffee and uh this entire
- [02:01] course will be available for lifetime.
- [02:03] You also have 30 days refund policy. So
- [02:06] let's say you buy this particular course
- [02:07] try out the videos and if you don't like
- [02:10] it within 30 days you can also get the
- [02:11] refund. What is the main aim in this
- [02:14] particular course is to build powerful
- [02:15] AI agents, automate task and create
- [02:17] advanced agentic AI system. Since
- [02:20] Microsoft autogen is from Microsoft
- [02:23] itself. So definitely you can understand
- [02:25] right what will be the importance of
- [02:27] this particular framework. Right?
- [02:28] because right now there are some less
- [02:31] number of companies which are really
- [02:33] really competitive in this market with
- [02:34] respect to developing LLM models,
- [02:36] frameworks and many more things and
- [02:38] Microsoft have definitely come up with
- [02:40] something autogen called as autogen for
- [02:43] a specific purpose. So uh in this course
- [02:45] you'll learn all about what are agents,
- [02:48] how to create autonomous agents, how to
- [02:50] interact with the microsoft autogen
- [02:52] framework, set up or configure autogen
- [02:54] to build AI systems, design and
- [02:56] implement custom agents and chat bots.
- [02:58] Uh we'll be talking about task like
- [03:00] coding, reasoning and decision making,
- [03:02] build and deploy real world multi- aents
- [03:04] workflow that automates complex end
- [03:06] toend task. Right? So here we are only
- [03:09] not focusing on building, we also
- [03:10] focusing on doing the deployment. Right?
- [03:12] So overall this course will be having
- [03:15] somewhere around 32.5 hours of course
- [03:18] and as we go ahead there are some more
- [03:19] projects that needs to be uh included.
- [03:22] So first of all we go ahead with Python.
- [03:24] Python is the prerequisites that you
- [03:25] definitely require. Then you have
- [03:27] paidentic. Then we start with entire
- [03:29] autogen. And if you keep on expan
- [03:31] expanding right there are projects, they
- [03:33] are use cases. There are good things.
- [03:36] There are techniques like how to
- [03:37] probably add human in the human in the
- [03:39] loop feedback. How to probably go ahead
- [03:41] and create a single agent. How to go go
- [03:43] ahead and create a multi-a
- [03:46] communicate with the other agent. You
- [03:47] know how to make sure to uh do this
- [03:50] collaboration of multi- agent in
- [03:51] autogen. All this specific thing is
- [03:53] done. Not only that, we also talk about
- [03:55] performance metrics. We talk about uh
- [03:57] you know uh building and configuring
- [03:59] configuring the autogen agent itself. We
- [04:02] have also shown you how to go ahead and
- [04:03] use the autogen studio. So there are a
- [04:06] whole
- [04:08] the whole set of topics that has been
- [04:10] discussed with respect to this and super
- [04:11] super excited to launch this particular
- [04:13] course. Now there is one more
- [04:15] announcement that whoever is from my
- [04:18] krishnag.in in batch uh in the live
- [04:20] classes I hope you have taken this
- [04:21] agentic AI right so if you are from this
- [04:24] specific batch or agentic 1.0 O batch
- [04:27] don't worry you don't need to probably
- [04:28] take this particular course because this
- [04:30] course will be provided completely for
- [04:32] free for everyone out there you know uh
- [04:35] and this is the pattern that we follow
- [04:37] whoever is the part of our live batches
- [04:39] we usually provide them free courses uh
- [04:41] from the Udemy so that they get the live
- [04:43] access okay uh along with this I would
- [04:46] suggest go ahead and try it out each and
- [04:48] everything over here right um the
- [04:50] prerequisite for this is that you need
- [04:52] to have some amount of Python
- [04:54] programming lang language knowledge even
- [04:56] though if you don't have I have already
- [04:57] provided it. You should know how to
- [04:58] write modular coding. You should have
- [05:00] some understanding of LM models,
- [05:02] generative AI models and all. Uh less
- [05:04] than all the things you know we have
- [05:06] explained things in a much more better
- [05:08] way. Each and every topics that you will
- [05:10] be specifically seeing over here will be
- [05:12] crisps and detail. The kind of materials
- [05:15] resources that we have specifically used
- [05:17] uh and everything is available for
- [05:20] lifetime at just a price of 399. This
- [05:22] offer just stays for 2 days. So, go
- [05:25] ahead and utilize this opportunity. And
- [05:27] yes, this was it from my side. I hope
- [05:29] you like this particular video. I'll see
- [05:30] you all in the next video. Thank you.
- [05:32] Have a great day. Bye-bye.
