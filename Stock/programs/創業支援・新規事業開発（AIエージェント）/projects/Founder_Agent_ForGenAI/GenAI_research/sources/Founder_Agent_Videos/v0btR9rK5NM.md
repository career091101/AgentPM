- [00:00] So yeah, let's uh let's go ahead and get
- [00:03] started. Um um so
- [00:07] some of you have already seen me for
- [00:09] those of you who have been here this uh
- [00:11] since this morning. So you have seen me.
- [00:12] My name is Raj Bal. I'm the founder of
- [00:14] Aento AI. I'm also the founder of data
- [00:16] science dojo but I mean Aento is a new
- [00:19] thing that I'm doing. Um so the uh in uh
- [00:24] in this panel we are going to focus on
- [00:26] MCP which is uh which is really central
- [00:30] to what we call context engineering and
- [00:33] uh MCP is being positioned as a as a
- [00:37] powerful way to simplify context
- [00:39] engineering for agentic AI applications.
- [00:42] Um and I like that analogy of the USBC
- [00:46] of all the data sources for LLM
- [00:48] applications.
- [00:50] Um so making it easy to connect uh you
- [00:53] know really more standardize uh
- [00:56] standardize your um data sharing with uh
- [01:01] uh in a manner that is very similar to
- [01:03] uh the rest APIs. Um so you standardize
- [01:07] you know all the AI agent connections to
- [01:10] tools, data sources and workflows. uh
- [01:13] but but as we uh start adopting uh MCP
- [01:18] tools, there are uh there are actually
- [01:21] uh concerns around governance and
- [01:24] security and primarily around um uh is
- [01:28] there a chance that these MCP servers
- [01:30] and tools they will become new vectors
- [01:33] for security risks. Uh what will be the
- [01:36] governance practice uh practices? Um and
- [01:39] uh we are uh we have built uh the
- [01:42] platform that we are building. I mean
- [01:43] one of the things that actually is uh is
- [01:46] a concern is where we are uh concerned
- [01:50] about the role based access to any MCP
- [01:53] calls and uh and how do organizations
- [01:57] actually balance the speed of innovation
- [01:59] with the guardrails and required
- [02:00] compliance and safety uh first. So I
- [02:05] will uh go ahead and um you know welcome
- [02:08] all of you. I will go ahead and ask you
- [02:10] all uh to go around and uh introduce
- [02:13] yourselves and uh we'll take it from
- [02:15] there. Uh Alex, you want to go first?
- [02:18] >> Hey uh I'm Alex Salazar. I am the
- [02:20] co-founder CEO of arcade.dev and we are
- [02:25] an MCP execution and authorization
- [02:28] platform. meaning that uh we have a
- [02:31] number of MCP servers and toolkits um
- [02:34] for for use for out of the box like
- [02:37] Google and Slack etc.
- [02:39] um we can execute custom MCP servers but
- [02:42] more importantly um we can handle uh
- [02:45] what's called agent authorization can
- [02:47] this agent on behalf of this user
- [02:49] perform this action on this resource and
- [02:52] that's one of the big one of the big
- [02:54] problems in SAP today so and uh my team
- [02:57] is most of my team is former octa
- [02:59] including myself
- [03:01] >> thank you Alex Mark you want to
- [03:03] >> sure nice to meet all of you uh my name
- [03:05] is Mark Cavage I'm president of docker
- [03:07] uh my background ground personally is
- [03:09] building developer platforms for I don't
- [03:10] know 25 30 years I guess I'm old at this
- [03:12] point I was early AWS I ran Java for a
- [03:14] while I ran most of Stripe um I've done
- [03:17] a lot of stuff u but I'm super excited
- [03:18] about where Docker is going um we're
- [03:20] super invested in developer productivity
- [03:22] security and AI um and across all those
- [03:25] AI and MCP kind of sit at the
- [03:27] intersection and what I'll say is um you
- [03:30] know we're in the nice position of
- [03:32] Docker being such a widely used and
- [03:34] ubiquitous platform I get the privilege
- [03:36] to talk to a ton of customers and users
- [03:38] And what I'll say is uh at this point I
- [03:40] feel like there's like at best 1% of the
- [03:42] population that is not thinking about
- [03:44] how to adopt MCP and that's an equal
- [03:47] amount of both excitement and euphoria
- [03:49] and also confusion and kind of like oh
- [03:52] my god I'm scared uh for all the reasons
- [03:54] kind of previously talked about. So
- [03:55] really excited to talk to you guys all
- [03:56] today and be here and talk about that.
- [03:59] >> Thank you Mark. Uh
- [04:02] >> hey thanks Raja. uh I lead uh
- [04:05] engineering for ecosystem and
- [04:07] marketplace at Atlassian. Um you know
- [04:09] I'm similar to you Mark very passionate
- [04:12] about platform and tool sets and enable
- [04:14] all builders across you know multiple
- [04:16] different uh uh you know uh geographies
- [04:19] as well as uh different uh uh industries
- [04:23] to be enable them to use the Atlassian
- [04:25] products and you know essentially my
- [04:26] teams build platforms that others can
- [04:28] extend and build on top of Atlassian. So
- [04:30] we have a forge platform to build
- [04:31] applications and now the Atlassian MCP
- [04:34] as well as of course more directly APIs
- [04:36] as well. So this helps uh the builders
- [04:38] and each of the enterprises then
- [04:40] customize the Atlassian instance that
- [04:43] they have to actually serve more and
- [04:45] more purposes beyond what we built out
- [04:47] of the box. So I'm super passionate
- [04:48] about this space um and really looking
- [04:51] forward to this conversation today about
- [04:52] how we think about MCP across the
- [04:54] industry.
- [04:56] >> Thank you so much Reena and thanks
- [04:57] everyone for um the introductions. So
- [05:00] let's uh uh dive right in. Um so um so
- [05:03] I'm an educator at heart, right? So I'm
- [05:05] an engineer but also an educator. So
- [05:07] first thing that I would like to do is
- [05:09] uh so we have a diverse audience. Uh
- [05:11] would any of you uh like to describe MCP
- [05:14] for anyone who has been in technology
- [05:17] but they don't know aki. So what is MCP
- [05:21] and why does it matter?
- [05:27] >> Nobody's going to jump. I can jump
- [05:29] >> just any of you.
- [05:30] >> Sure. Yeah. Um I'll I'll I'll start and
- [05:33] then uh yeah, Alex and Rita jump in. Um
- [05:36] uh the the way I mean Raj, you kind of
- [05:39] said this at the beginning, MCP is just
- [05:40] sort of this universal description of
- [05:42] how to present your systems and your
- [05:44] your data um and your services to an
- [05:47] LLM. And you know, an LLM doesn't
- [05:50] actually make calls for you. It tells
- [05:52] you what it wants to go call. So
- [05:53] something has to describe what that what
- [05:55] those things are. So for example, if you
- [05:57] have, you know, a Postgress database or
- [05:59] a Graphana interface or a Jira catalog
- [06:01] or whatever, you know, you can you can
- [06:04] in the old days you would basically have
- [06:06] to describe that all manually to the LM
- [06:07] of here's this thing that you can call
- [06:09] me back for and get access to. MCP is a
- [06:11] standardized way of doing that and gives
- [06:13] you these building blocks for both how
- [06:15] to connect to it and sort of a standard
- [06:17] for how to go present that information.
- [06:19] So you can, you know, the the the unit
- [06:21] the the the metaphor that always goes
- [06:22] around is the USB socket or USBC socket
- [06:24] for um uh uh for LMs, but think of it as
- [06:28] effectively just a standard way of
- [06:30] describing some system that you want to
- [06:32] get the LM to understand and be able to
- [06:34] interrogate and act on.
- [06:36] >> Yeah, I'll that's a great definition.
- [06:39] I'll I'll build on that. Um if you look
- [06:42] at how an agent's built, there's there's
- [06:45] just there's a few tiers that every
- [06:47] agent has. You have the large language
- [06:49] model acting as the brain coordinating
- [06:52] how the workflow is being executed. You
- [06:55] have some semblance of an orchestration
- [06:58] system that's building some
- [07:00] predetermined set of workflows or rough
- [07:02] approximations of workflows around that
- [07:03] large language model. And then all of
- [07:06] those workflows ultimately
- [07:08] tend to terminate a tool call. Um this
- [07:11] is where the that the agent takes an
- [07:13] action and that could be a retrieval, it
- [07:14] could be a manipulation, um it could be
- [07:17] anything.
- [07:19] when the agent goes to take an action,
- [07:21] the protocol between the agent and the
- [07:24] action increasingly is becoming MCP.
- [07:27] Now, I think where I think people are
- [07:30] getting really tripped up with MCP in a
- [07:33] in true agent building is they they're
- [07:36] using them like like APIs. Um, and I
- [07:40] think that's why so many uh agents are
- [07:42] having a hard time. um MCP like APIs are
- [07:46] a service contract. They are describing
- [07:49] how your service works so that another
- [07:51] service can interact with it.
- [07:54] That's not a really good use of MCP. Um
- [07:57] APIs are actually great for that. Um MCP
- [07:59] is best used when it's the actually the
- [08:01] inverse. It is kind of like the service
- [08:04] contract for the agent of what it's
- [08:06] trying to do. And so, um, you know,
- [08:10] having like a like a MongoDB or a Jira
- [08:13] MCP service, it's valuable for sure, but
- [08:16] the agent almost never actually cares
- [08:18] about the downstream service. It really
- [08:21] cares about the action it's trying to
- [08:22] take. And I'll give you a really, really
- [08:24] mundane example. Um, let's say that I'm
- [08:26] building a sales agent and it's going to
- [08:29] help me brief, you know, my rep before
- [08:31] they walk into an account, you know, so
- [08:33] I have a one pager and the right
- [08:34] brochures and the right talking points,
- [08:36] all that fun stuff. It's going to hit
- [08:37] the CRM. It's going to hit Google Drive
- [08:38] for brochures. It's going to check email
- [08:41] for past communication. So, let's say we
- [08:43] have a Google Drive tool, Google Drive
- [08:45] toolkit, Google Drive MCP. Let's assume
- [08:47] Google was all in on MCP. Uh, my agent,
- [08:50] if I was using the direct Google Drive
- [08:52] MCP server, would need to know how to
- [08:56] traverse the Google Drive, you know,
- [09:00] file structure to go find the right
- [09:01] brochures. To do that, right, I need to
- [09:04] stuff context into the agent to explain
- [09:07] to it how to find the right brochures by
- [09:09] using Drive. The better way to do it is
- [09:12] to build a brochure MCP server because
- [09:15] that's what the agent's attempting to
- [09:16] do. And then that thing can talk to a
- [09:19] Google Drive MCP server if it wants to.
- [09:22] Truth is, it's probably better off
- [09:23] talking to the Google APIs
- [09:25] because that's really the the thing
- [09:27] that's trying to be achieved. MCP or
- [09:29] tools in general are intentbased
- [09:32] workflows, not service based contracts.
- [09:36] >> Yeah. Uh thank you, Alex and Mark.
- [09:38] Right. So I I love the I love the way
- [09:40] you described it. Uh so so basically
- [09:43] what you're saying is that the
- [09:44] responsibility for uh describing the
- [09:47] contract is on the publisher side.
- [09:49] whoever publishes the MCP server and
- [09:51] then the caller it because I just uh I
- [09:55] just call uh in natural language and the
- [09:58] on the other side it is the job of the
- [10:01] uh the MCP server publisher to actually
- [10:04] standardize how
- [10:05] >> oh I would say the way around right like
- [10:08] you know hot take I think the reason why
- [10:10] you know so many of the services are
- [10:12] releasing MCP servers and they're
- [10:14] getting adoption is because the first
- [10:16] wave of MCP adoption are is cursor and
- [10:21] warp, right? It is it is general
- [10:24] engineering services. And so when the
- [10:27] user is trying to like when trying to
- [10:30] communicate about what they want to do
- [10:31] in a prompt when they want to interact
- [10:33] with Jira or linear or you know docker
- [10:36] or MongoDB they are stating intentions
- [10:39] that are almost tightly onetoone mapped
- [10:42] to what those services do. Um, I'll give
- [10:46] you an example. Like I I actually have
- [10:48] just as much success, if not more, using
- [10:51] the AWS or the GitHub command line tool
- [10:54] in my agent than I do the actual MCP
- [10:57] server because the intent is mapped
- [11:00] almost one to one. Um, but if you look
- [11:03] at the agents that are being built in
- [11:04] the enterprise or in production, they
- [11:07] have nothing to do with the downstream
- [11:08] services, right? like they're trying to
- [11:10] achieve a higher order business goal and
- [11:12] the downstream services are really
- [11:14] implementation details. And so like an
- [11:17] MCP server in in practice in in in
- [11:20] production is just tightly coupled to
- [11:23] the agents intent. And so what we've
- [11:25] been seeing is that they do best when
- [11:28] they're written by the application
- [11:30] developer, not the downstream service
- [11:33] provider.
- [11:34] >> Yeah. Yeah.
- [11:35] >> Yeah. I would I would plus one that I
- [11:37] think the best uses that we're finding
- [11:39] as well is when we're describing in the
- [11:41] MCP server tools as how we would want
- [11:45] that agentic application to use it and
- [11:47] you know really um inside the MCP server
- [11:50] the most critical part is the tools that
- [11:51] we're exposing and then how we are
- [11:53] actually describing the intent of those
- [11:55] tools and the tools are not a onetoone
- [11:57] mapping with the APIs they will use APIs
- [11:59] underlying it but often times it's a
- [12:01] combination of multiple APIs that bring
- [12:04] it
- [12:06] And Mark, do you want to add something?
- [12:08] >> I I'll just double down on what Alex and
- [12:10] Rena both said. Alex said that and Reena
- [12:11] just said at the end that really this
- [12:13] point of the MCPs being effectively like
- [12:16] deacto teddy is I have a rest API and I
- [12:18] slapped an MCP on top of it. That is a
- [12:20] starting point. But to Alex's point
- [12:22] doesn't it only it only kind of works.
- [12:24] And actually the way I I give a lot of
- [12:25] people advice this is it's incredibly
- [12:27] easy to write an basic MCP server that
- [12:29] does that. It's actually incredibly hard
- [12:31] to write one that's good that actually
- [12:33] expresses intent and actually solves
- [12:35] goals that are built for an LLM. Like
- [12:37] there's a big difference between REST
- [12:38] APIs for curl and what the LM actually
- [12:40] needs. And I think that gap is something
- [12:43] everybody's kind of trying to still
- [12:45] figure out as we as basically as we
- [12:46] speak. So
- [12:47] >> yeah, and that gap is measured very
- [12:50] objectively um and quantifiably. It is
- [12:53] about token minimization,
- [12:56] error rate minimization, and latency
- [12:58] minimization. And so if you give an
- [13:01] agent a generic MCP server, like the
- [13:05] most the the the hardest example, the
- [13:07] one that most people fail on is like a
- [13:09] database MCP server, right? If you give
- [13:12] your agent like a MongoDB MCP server and
- [13:17] you just interact directly with it,
- [13:19] you're going to have a very hard time.
- [13:20] you're going to have to stuff it with so
- [13:22] much context. You're going to have to do
- [13:24] so many turns on it to get what you want
- [13:27] that you're ultimately going to consume
- [13:29] a ton of tokens. You're going to have
- [13:32] really high latency and as a result of
- [13:34] both of those, you're going to have high
- [13:36] error rates. And that's not nothing to
- [13:38] do with MongoDB. They did a great job
- [13:39] with their with their MCP server. I
- [13:41] think it's a fantastic implementation.
- [13:43] It's just you're using the wrong tool
- [13:44] for the wrong job. What the developer
- [13:47] should be doing is they should be
- [13:48] building an MCP server themselves that
- [13:52] represents the kinds of activity or
- [13:55] intentions that the agent wants to
- [13:57] perform that just happen to consume
- [14:01] MongoDB.
- [14:03] And when you do that, it's a one shot.
- [14:06] It's like, hey, pull up users. There's
- [14:08] no checking the database to see do you
- [14:10] what does your table even look like? the
- [14:12] SCP server already encapsulates like
- [14:15] what it means to look up a user. So,
- [14:17] it's one it's one call. There's you
- [14:20] don't you don't need very much context
- [14:21] at all. Um and as a result, it's
- [14:24] cheaper, faster, and lower error rate.
- [14:27] >> Okay.
- [14:28] >> And Alex, I'm glad you pointed this out,
- [14:30] right? So, so some of the MCP servers
- [14:32] that uh I've used, I don't want to name
- [14:34] names here, right? So, in many cases,
- [14:37] right? So, um so my intent is missed,
- [14:40] right? So what I'm trying to do it it
- [14:42] really it really doesn't get done right.
- [14:44] So uh so
- [14:47] uh does does this uh uh does this
- [14:50] actually
- [14:52] um make you um you know so if it is more
- [14:55] of a descriptive or generative task
- [14:58] that's a different story but if it is
- [15:00] more an action that I have to take right
- [15:02] so any misfired action based on a wrong
- [15:07] understanding or interpretation of my
- [15:09] intent it can actually expose the
- [15:11] organization to all sorts of problems.
- [15:14] So my next question actually the
- [15:16] follow-up question is going to be uh so
- [15:19] what are the most pressing uh security
- [15:22] and governance uh risks when deploying
- [15:24] MCP right so the the so-called arbback
- [15:29] or role based access control right so uh
- [15:31] when you deploy an MCP server uh uh is
- [15:34] it going to be the system user that is
- [15:37] going to be deploying it or is it going
- [15:39] to be individual when I use it is it my
- [15:42] application that is using that MCP P
- [15:43] server or am I using it as Raja right so
- [15:46] and going and using that MCP server so
- [15:48] my question for uh for you um perhaps
- [15:51] Mark maybe I can start with you here um
- [15:55] so h how what are the most pressing uh
- [15:58] security risks uh when deploying MCPs uh
- [16:01] because you are you're doing a lot of
- [16:03] work in that space so let let's start
- [16:06] with Mark right and and how do these
- [16:08] differ uh from a traditional API or
- [16:10] plug-in integration
- [16:12] >> sure yeah actually I'm going to get to
- [16:13] that. I I do want to hit on a point or
- [16:15] build on something Alex just said though
- [16:16] on this because I I I don't know about
- [16:18] Reena and Alex if you guys have this
- [16:19] experience. Um I talked to a lot of
- [16:21] people about MCP and like the thing that
- [16:23] comes up is like oh what are we talking
- [16:24] about? It'll all be MCP remotes and it's
- [16:26] all fine. And the thing I keep telling
- [16:28] people is literally what Alex just said
- [16:29] and why why we're so invested in Docker
- [16:31] on these being containers being the
- [16:32] right platform from this. You can can
- [16:34] change where you deploy it. I deeply
- [16:36] believe everybody's got to get their
- [16:37] head around the thing Alex said of you
- [16:39] you the application developer have to go
- [16:41] write an MCP server that can itself
- [16:43] build on somebody. You can go build on
- [16:45] the you can build on the stripe,
- [16:46] you can build on the Twilio, that'll all
- [16:48] be useful, but so much of these things
- [16:50] are actually about business goals. And
- [16:51] the business goal is fundamentally about
- [16:53] that organization and their setup that I
- [16:55] think most people you're not going to
- [16:57] actually get what you want with most
- [16:59] off-the-shelf things. You're going to
- [17:00] have to go build a lot of these
- [17:01] yourselves and actually put the thought
- [17:03] and logic into that. So that's anyway
- [17:04] just as a as an assertion this is why
- [17:06] like we know I'll put the one the one
- [17:08] shameless plug above um
- [17:10] >> and Mark and Mark you're referring to
- [17:12] this as a consumer on my a consumer or
- [17:14] as a publisher of MCP server right so so
- [17:17] as a consumer I have to add
- [17:20] >> honestly honestly I think either so
- [17:22] there's the people building MCP servers
- [17:23] that want you know let's call them an
- [17:25] independent software value arena and you
- [17:26] want you're an ISV you need to have a
- [17:28] you know MCP server out for your stack
- [17:30] or your Docker or whatever else and then
- [17:33] but a consumer if you if you posit that
- [17:36] everybody is writing agents in the year
- [17:37] 2025 or if everybody's at least thinking
- [17:39] about writing agents and in 2026 they're
- [17:40] definitely writing agents if you're
- [17:43] doing that you basically have to both
- [17:45] consume MCP and produce MCPS yourself
- [17:48] and so there's not really a difference
- [17:50] in my opinion and in which case this
- [17:52] really requires you to then effectively
- [17:53] go back to okay what does it take to
- [17:55] build and package software because
- [17:57] that's all it is and how to go share
- [17:59] that with somebody else and you have all
- [18:00] the same problems that you've always had
- [18:02] around okay where's the credentials
- [18:03] where does it run? How do I get it
- [18:05] there? How do I share to somebody else?
- [18:06] How do I version it? How do I revoke it?
- [18:08] Like all that stuff. And so that's, you
- [18:09] know, just we we we at Docker have been
- [18:11] putting a very emphatic uh voice out to
- [18:13] the industry that OCI uh container open
- [18:16] container initiative is the right way to
- [18:18] go do that and package the ones that you
- [18:20] yourself build regardless what you're
- [18:22] consuming. Anyways, that's my my plug on
- [18:24] the uh
- [18:26] before I get into the security the
- [18:28] security panel section of Alex. Alex,
- [18:29] you're going to jump in.
- [18:31] No, I I actually that's a great lead
- [18:33] into a security comp to your own
- [18:34] security answer about tell. But I would
- [18:36] say that we actually agree with you. We
- [18:38] all of our all of our toolkits are
- [18:41] containerized with Docker
- [18:42] >> because I don't know how else you would
- [18:44] do it. Uh it's madness without it. Uh
- [18:47] but anyways, Mike, back to you. I think
- [18:49] you're answering the security question.
- [18:50] >> Yeah. Yeah. But that mostly that's a it
- [18:53] was a was a good was a good build and a
- [18:54] good, you know, a good thing for people
- [18:56] to understand that you're going to be
- [18:57] writing them yourself. whether you're
- [18:58] going to use them or not, you're going
- [18:59] to write them yourself. Okay. So, in
- [19:01] terms of like what are the problems and
- [19:02] what's different um I'll give you some
- [19:04] I'll give you some kind of hot take
- [19:05] snarky takes and then some actual you
- [19:07] know substantive things. Um hot take I
- [19:09] think right now like nobody knows what's
- [19:11] going on. You do talk to any company and
- [19:12] effectively I get the following story of
- [19:14] like what are you doing with AI? I'm all
- [19:16] in on co-pilot. We love the co-pilot.
- [19:17] Oh, but then the developers found cursor
- [19:19] and then oh my god I don't know what
- [19:20] they connected to the cursor to the Jira
- [19:22] to the service now and like it's madness
- [19:24] and I don't know what's going on. That's
- [19:26] effectively every company that um I
- [19:28] speak to. And I think what that means
- [19:31] then really is at the most basic level
- [19:32] before we get to all the fancy things of
- [19:34] MCP, it's actually to start with like
- [19:36] basic observability auditing and kill
- [19:38] switches like that's the things I think
- [19:40] people are fundamentally struggling with
- [19:41] right now because you've got very much
- [19:43] the decentralized um uh adoption of the
- [19:46] coding agents all like cloud code etc.
- [19:48] and very much decentralized and
- [19:50] democratized um kind of organizational
- [19:53] push and thesis that we don't want to
- [19:54] miss out. We want everybody using all
- [19:56] the AI they can. We'll figure out how
- [19:58] to, you know, control costs and control
- [20:00] things later. But right now, I think
- [20:02] just basics on inside most
- [20:04] organizations, they're really struggling
- [20:05] with just even getting to that number
- [20:07] one. But then in terms of the actual
- [20:08] problems then beyond the the you know
- [20:10] the the baseline, you know, whatever you
- [20:13] you can go it'll take you 30 seconds to
- [20:16] ask chat GPT or or Google for a long
- [20:18] list and we'll tell you about a 100
- [20:19] different problems. But um if I were to
- [20:21] pick just a couple of them um you know
- [20:23] prompt injection I think is the one and
- [20:25] tool poisoning are the big ones that you
- [20:26] know everybody thinks about. But because
- [20:27] it's so um it's so easy to say but it's
- [20:31] also so easy for it to actually happen.
- [20:33] Like there's a you know we we at Docker
- [20:34] published these horror story blogs.
- [20:36] They're worth reading if you haven't but
- [20:37] one of them is about actually the GitHub
- [20:39] injection. It's like cool. This is
- [20:41] actually like you could almost imagine
- [20:43] even if it weren't like the truly most
- [20:44] malicious attacker that was like
- [20:45] poisoning GitHub issues with like prompt
- [20:47] injections. you could almost imagine the
- [20:49] ele getting tricked and even with
- [20:50] innocuous things. So one is one is that
- [20:53] um you know I think the identity the
- [20:55] identity and secrets management is like
- [20:56] I don't know else to put it but it's a
- [20:58] total pain in the ass. Um and so that's
- [21:00] I think just a you know kind of a really
- [21:02] hard thing for people to to get their
- [21:03] head around in particular around where
- [21:05] they run and like again who you share it
- [21:06] to and there's just so much of this
- [21:08] divide between what's a system agent,
- [21:09] what's an agent acting on my Mark's
- [21:11] behalf or my Roger's behalf or so on
- [21:14] versus what's one for the team. Like
- [21:15] it's just it's hard. Um I think you know
- [21:18] basically people what in practice like
- [21:21] we're kind of building on this story of
- [21:22] well people connect the cursor to all
- [21:25] their systems and all the tools are just
- [21:26] super pro promiscuous and over
- [21:28] permissive and I don't know everybody I
- [21:30] know just hits the yolo button of like
- [21:32] okay I'm I'm tired of hitting the I'm
- [21:34] tired of hitting the allow button I'll
- [21:35] hit the allow every time like just make
- [21:36] it all go away in which case it becomes
- [21:38] very easy for these things to start
- [21:40] getting chained in ways that you don't
- [21:41] understand and because you don't have
- [21:42] observability it makes it that much
- [21:44] worse. Um, and then of course you'd have
- [21:46] all the other supply chain risks of
- [21:47] people, you know, injecting a bad tool
- [21:49] and so on. And then you kind of asked
- [21:51] the very last thing and I'll I'll turn
- [21:53] over to to Reena and Alex to build on.
- [21:55] You know, you asked like what's
- [21:56] different about this than just APIs and
- [21:58] and so on as part of the question. And
- [22:00] Alex kind of said this at the very
- [22:02] beginning like there's this huge shift
- [22:03] of you're not writing code anymore and
- [22:05] you're not making decisions. The LM is
- [22:06] the LM is the decision maker which means
- [22:08] you get very non-deterministic results
- [22:10] every time it runs. you use a tool which
- [22:12] makes it very hard to have trustable
- [22:14] guard rails. And so you know that
- [22:16] coupled with the like how just the mere
- [22:18] nature of how low friction it is to
- [22:20] connect these things just in makes you
- [22:22] know massive amounts of blond rate
- [22:24] massive amounts of blast radius. So you
- [22:26] know that's as I keep saying it's
- [22:28] incredibly easy to write a basic MCP
- [22:30] server in particular one that does reads
- [22:31] and even then you'll still have
- [22:33] injections and risks and and data
- [22:35] leakage and it's incredibly hard to
- [22:37] write something that is both useful and
- [22:39] safe. So that's my my my take on what
- [22:41] what I see a lot of.
- [22:44] >> Yeah.
- [22:45] Can I can I build on that?
- [22:48] >> Uh go uh Alex if I can then I'll jump
- [22:51] in. So yeah I I think I think great
- [22:53] great context on that one Mark. I think
- [22:55] what what kind of you know being on the
- [22:57] builder side here and where we are kind
- [22:59] of you know really custodians of
- [23:00] enterprise data and protectors of it. We
- [23:02] do kind of you know take all of those
- [23:04] very seriously from our perspective. So
- [23:06] I think it you know all of your points
- [23:08] actually just don't go away. So I think
- [23:10] kind of you know as we're moving from
- [23:11] like you know uh humans making decisions
- [23:13] to LLM making decisions like you said um
- [23:16] the the controls kind of stay the same.
- [23:18] In fact, they just get enhanced is how
- [23:20] we think about it, right? And how I
- [23:22] think about it also is that uh you know,
- [23:24] giving admins still the controls about
- [23:26] what what uh what MCPS they allow inside
- [23:29] their their system to then connect a
- [23:31] cursor or copilot or whatever that new
- [23:33] agent may be is very very critical and
- [23:36] it in fact becomes even more kind of
- [23:37] required now to say okay what are the
- [23:39] tools that those uh that those kind of
- [23:41] agents are actually or those MCB servers
- [23:44] are actually building and providing to
- [23:45] my users? how much access do they
- [23:47] control do they have and really kind of
- [23:49] you know the question that Raja was
- [23:50] asking is like do the uh do the
- [23:53] granularity of it at the system level or
- [23:55] the arbback or the user level go away
- [23:57] it's like no they they stay the same I
- [23:58] think the those kind of you know just
- [24:00] manifest into different uh personas and
- [24:02] different kind of entities right now so
- [24:04] I think as a as a MCP server builder we
- [24:08] not just have to worry about you know uh
- [24:10] what our server is doing but also what
- [24:12] is the client we're enabling on the
- [24:14] other side who's the host and what are
- [24:16] their security practices and
- [24:17] requirements and and possibly going to
- [24:19] protect ourselves from other MCP servers
- [24:21] that they are also going to be enabling
- [24:23] in the same context because that is
- [24:24] where the leakage of the data and other
- [24:26] kind of you know proliferations could
- [24:27] happen as well. So there is a kind of
- [24:29] you know I think the security piece is
- [24:30] just getting more and more heightened
- [24:32] exactly what you're saying here Mark too
- [24:34] and um I think the uh the onus on the
- [24:38] data governance both from the admins as
- [24:40] well as the builders of software like us
- [24:42] kind of you know just goes up even more.
- [24:45] >> So if if I if I bring it down a level
- [24:48] right now no one can write an MCP server
- [24:51] that is not a service account unless you
- [24:54] are the vendor. And so um everything we
- [24:57] just talked about I'm building an agent
- [24:59] I want to talk to you know I want to
- [25:00] talk to Jira as an example um or I want
- [25:03] to talk to Google I can't write that MCP
- [25:05] server and not and do anything other
- [25:07] than give it a service account because
- [25:09] the spec does not support
- [25:12] >> uh delegated authorization and so there
- [25:15] is no way for today for an agent to act
- [25:19] on as as an agent on my behalf in a
- [25:24] scoped privileged a to any downstream
- [25:27] service. The spec doesn't support it.
- [25:29] Um, now we as Arcade, we contributed
- [25:32] this an RFC to the spec. It was recently
- [25:35] accepted um to go enable this uh to
- [25:40] enable delegated authorization so that I
- [25:42] so that Chad GPT can send an email
- [25:44] because it's still it's 20 it's almost
- [25:45] 2026 and you still can't send an email
- [25:47] from Chad GPT for this reason. Um, if
- [25:50] you want to build an agent that sends
- [25:52] email, you can't. Uh, as a user, if you
- [25:55] the reason there aren't personal
- [25:56] assistant agents is because they can't
- [25:58] access your calendar. Um, and so that is
- [26:01] the biggest problem uh in an MCP right
- [26:05] now in my opinion and in agent
- [26:06] development. You can't have an agent act
- [26:08] on your behalf unless you give it a
- [26:11] service account. And service accounts
- [26:13] are a non-starter in the enterprise
- [26:15] because it creates what's called an
- [26:16] authorization bypass vulnerability. And
- [26:19] so if I give a service account, you
- [26:21] know, any level of of of of access in a
- [26:24] system like Jira or Google or SAP or
- [26:27] whatever and it's anything other than
- [26:29] the lowest common denominator of the
- [26:31] user and then the intern gets access to
- [26:34] the agent, the intern just privile just
- [26:36] escalated their privileges.
- [26:38] And so
- [26:40] this is why when we talk to
- [26:41] organizations that are trying to put
- [26:43] agents in production, which surprisingly
- [26:45] are a lot of the Fortune 500 and 1000,
- [26:49] they're having to kill their agent
- [26:50] projects because they can't pass
- [26:52] security review because they can't
- [26:53] handle scoped access on behalf of a
- [26:55] user.
- [26:57] >> The only So I'll I'll jump on one thing
- [26:59] there. So I agree on all that. The one
- [27:02] caveat that I I will say that I'm seeing
- [27:04] now which has been surprising to me, but
- [27:05] I see this because we're the desktop
- [27:07] people. We have Docker Desktop. We're
- [27:09] seeing a bunch of agents actually get
- [27:10] built that are effectively not being
- [27:13] deployed to something like a backend
- [27:14] which limits, you know, things like
- [27:15] Slack connectivity and so on. But for
- [27:18] me, I want to I want to make my claude
- [27:19] send an email. Like effectively this is
- [27:21] what people are using Docker Desktop for
- [27:23] is because I can get
- [27:24] >> Mark's OOTH token injected into Docker's
- [27:27] MCP gateway on the desktop and then
- [27:29] actually it may funny enough what I the
- [27:31] way I term this is I'm basically seeing
- [27:32] the desktop become the new production
- [27:34] endpoint because because a the coding
- [27:36] agent runs there and b well you can
- [27:38] actually solve a bunch of these problems
- [27:40] because you already have them
- [27:41] effectively with either you know one
- [27:43] password of the keychain or you can at
- [27:45] least get you know configuration of ooth
- [27:46] injected manually. And so what funny
- [27:49] that's all true except for this one
- [27:52] thing of all of a sudden seeing desktop
- [27:53] usage like spike for that exact purpose.
- [27:56] >> Yeah, actually I'll comment on that. So
- [27:57] we we've been seeing that too, but it is
- [27:59] a bit of an illusion largely and I'm not
- [28:01] surprised that you guys at Docker are
- [28:03] seeing it because the illusion is
- [28:04] largely that the early adopters of MCP
- [28:07] and MCP desktop with standard IO with a
- [28:09] standard IO interface are developers and
- [28:12] DevOps people, right? and so that
- [28:13] they're very comfortable, you know,
- [28:15] running and installing these things on
- [28:16] their machines and and and the types of
- [28:18] things that they're talking to lend
- [28:20] themselves to these interactions. One of
- [28:22] the big problems though, even with that
- [28:24] model, is that in those scenarios that
- [28:27] MCP server, it assumes the identity
- [28:30] >> of the user. It's not acting on behalf
- [28:33] of the user. It is the user. And that's
- [28:36] that's not a security problem. It's a
- [28:38] safety problem. And so I've seen cursor
- [28:41] try and delete my root directory um
- [28:45] accidentally. Now thankfully it doesn't
- [28:46] have pseudo access. And so when it tried
- [28:48] it failed and it was very kind. It
- [28:50] apologized profusely. Um but when the
- [28:54] agents act at like when they act as you
- [28:57] and they assume your roles and your
- [28:59] credentials without having like a
- [29:01] delegated authorization model. Then they
- [29:05] can delete emails, they can delete
- [29:07] drive, they can delete folders. like
- [29:09] there's there's no way other than how
- [29:11] you construct the MCP server. There's no
- [29:14] way to and like to to scope what the
- [29:16] agent can do separate from the user. And
- [29:18] so the right way to do it is basically
- [29:20] OOTH. You have an application that's
- [29:23] registered that has its own scopes and
- [29:25] claims as your agent. And so you can
- [29:27] say, "Hey agent, you can't delete email,
- [29:28] but you can read them." And then you
- [29:30] have the user's identity and their
- [29:32] permissions, which is I can only read
- [29:34] and access my email. And then the
- [29:37] intersection of the two gives you
- [29:38] security and safety, but it's early
- [29:41] innings like this is what we do as a
- [29:43] business. Um, help people with that, but
- [29:46] the spec is catching up. And so it's a
- [29:49] problem right now. We're all bullish
- [29:50] that it's going to be much easier in
- [29:53] about 6 months or earlier, but it's one
- [29:55] of the biggest problems right now.
- [29:56] >> Yeah. So, Alex, speaking of uh you know
- [29:59] uh cursor apologizing profusely, if it
- [30:02] had it had deleted it, it would have a
- [30:05] apologized more profusely actually. I
- [30:06] mean, I' I've read those horror stories.
- [30:08] I mean, they just uh you know, but but
- [30:10] yeah, so let's let's actually use this
- [30:13] as segue, right? So, on the building
- [30:15] side of it, so uh so Reena, I know that
- [30:18] Atlassian has been working on uh MCP
- [30:21] servers for their products. So uh so
- [30:24] what what are some of the in your
- [30:27] opinion as as someone who's releasing
- [30:29] this to your customer I mean you have a
- [30:31] huge customer base a lot of adoption
- [30:34] what are you what are the potential
- [30:35] implications of any lapses that uh that
- [30:38] came up in your product meetings say hey
- [30:40] I mean we don't want to do this if we if
- [30:42] we allow this action this might happen
- [30:45] if we disallow this is going to be a
- [30:47] product you know it's going to be a poor
- [30:49] customer experience so um how do you can
- [30:52] Can you walk us through and give us an
- [30:54] idea what are some of the potential
- [30:56] implications and what is the thinking
- [30:58] process behind uh when you're uh
- [31:00] building these MCPs alert?
- [31:02] >> Yeah, definitely you know security is
- [31:04] paramount for however we think about it.
- [31:07] You know before we develop a product the
- [31:09] first thing is like okay what's what's
- [31:10] the security guard rails and constraints
- [31:12] and you know um audit points and
- [31:14] checkpoints that we're going to put in
- [31:15] the system. So that's definitely been
- [31:17] one of the key guiding principles for
- [31:19] MCP and MCB as we are just discussing
- [31:21] it's like so new that you know we're
- [31:23] still kind of getting around to
- [31:24] understanding it fully. Of course the uh
- [31:26] oath 2.1 uh implementation is something
- [31:29] that we've adopted completely and that
- [31:31] that gives us the overlying uh or would
- [31:34] say the boundaries around the uh the
- [31:37] authentication piece that Alex was
- [31:38] mentioning. So that's one that we kind
- [31:39] of you know make sure that we are doing
- [31:41] definitely to start with. what uh what
- [31:43] kind of you know continues to be a
- [31:44] challenge is uh uh the uh the pieces
- [31:47] that you know we do want to kind of give
- [31:50] access and control to the admins to do.
- [31:52] So we want to give the admins much much
- [31:54] more of the controls at the same time
- [31:55] while we are building our MCP servers in
- [31:58] a way which is secure. um give the
- [32:00] admins controls for you know what they
- [32:02] want to be enabling which types of
- [32:04] agents they want to be enabling to be
- [32:05] using RMCB server itself as well so that
- [32:08] they can control their uh the uh egress
- [32:11] of the enterprise data which is really
- [32:13] kind of you know their crown jewels and
- [32:15] u the audit trails that they need to
- [32:17] have in addition to say you know the
- [32:19] pseudo access type issues or something
- [32:20] really nasty if it did happen as well do
- [32:23] they even know kind of what happened and
- [32:25] do they have the ability to trace back
- [32:27] uh we definitely don't want any of those
- [32:29] things to happen in the first place. So
- [32:30] what our approach really has been you
- [32:32] know let's start with the being mindful
- [32:34] of exposing the tools that we start with
- [32:37] as well so that we are kind of you know
- [32:38] being super careful about what could be
- [32:41] destructive actions that could be taken
- [32:43] uh around the data itself and uh you
- [32:45] know making those much more u uh
- [32:49] constrained and restrained around that
- [32:51] aspect as well. Um so this is this is
- [32:54] really kind of you know our uh key
- [32:55] tenants here that we ensure that the
- [32:57] security and data governance of our
- [33:00] customers data is something that we are
- [33:02] controlling and then of course we are
- [33:03] giving the admins the tools and the
- [33:05] granularity that they can then uh
- [33:07] control while also kind of you know
- [33:08] really enjoying all of the benefits that
- [33:10] they uh that they want to be and we we
- [33:12] want them to also have through the new
- [33:14] agentic AI workflows that they can
- [33:16] enable.
- [33:17] So, so uh do you think a misconfigure
- [33:19] misconfigured MCP um tool or MCP server
- [33:24] I mean can an intern delete my entire
- [33:26] git repository that have been on
- [33:28] >> definitely not that's that's exactly why
- [33:30] we don't we don't expose tools that make
- [33:32] those happen either so you know that's
- [33:34] kind of definitely the paramount piece
- [33:36] is like what tools are we exposing in
- [33:38] the first place and that's up to us to
- [33:40] to control
- [33:42] >> this is great and thanks Reina uh so so
- [33:44] Mark um uh Docker is sitting at this uh
- [33:48] you know they they have built this
- [33:49] ecosystem you know for you know other uh
- [33:53] you know containerization and and now
- [33:56] even for MCP right so you have an MCP
- [33:58] image it makes it actually quite
- [33:59] convenient to go and get that MCP server
- [34:02] deployed in no time actually I love I
- [34:04] love that as uh you know as an engineer
- [34:07] how do you vet this out I mean this is I
- [34:09] I don't even know how you must vet this
- [34:11] out because how do you mitigate uh the
- [34:14] the supply chain and open-source risk
- [34:16] risks and uh you know abuse and misuse
- [34:19] or how do you vet out?
- [34:21] >> Yep. No, great question. Well, one, I'm
- [34:23] very I'm very glad you found it easy and
- [34:25] and you were happy with it. That's
- [34:26] actually
- [34:27] >> Yeah, I love it, too. Um in terms of you
- [34:29] know, how do we vet it? Um yeah, this is
- [34:31] the part where it this is part of why
- [34:33] I'm so excited for us at Docker to be
- [34:35] doing this. Look, we can build on top of
- [34:36] the shoulders and foundation of what
- [34:37] we've been doing for the last 10 years.
- [34:39] So ignoring MCP for a moment um you know
- [34:41] Docker Hub is this vast
- [34:44] vast ocean of things out there that you
- [34:46] can go pull and um you know we billions
- [34:49] of polls you know a month come out of
- [34:51] it. Um there is however a Docker
- [34:54] official images curated section where
- [34:56] we've been for the last decade working
- [34:58] with open source and upstream on
- [35:00] effectively every project that you know
- [35:03] is the top whatever 100 200 or so that
- [35:05] that really matter to folks. Um, and
- [35:08] effectively it kind of looks like a
- [35:09] distro where we stamp and certify that
- [35:12] the source and the maintenance of those
- [35:13] packages is good that there's not
- [35:15] vulnerabilities and we build that on our
- [35:17] systems. So we've been doing that for a
- [35:19] long time for base images, application
- [35:21] images, framework images, etc. For the
- [35:24] MCP catalog, of course you can publish
- [35:26] your own, but for the point of getting
- [35:29] to curation of how do you actually know
- [35:30] what you trust and what you vet and so
- [35:32] on. effectively we have this cheat code
- [35:34] of well I could build on top of the
- [35:35] exact processes we have or we're already
- [35:37] pretty good at working with open open
- [35:38] source and upstream and so yes MCP
- [35:41] requires a new cast of characters that
- [35:43] didn't exist before um to work in there
- [35:45] but effectively we're able to use the
- [35:47] same process and the same you know and
- [35:50] this this is not a thing I can tell you
- [35:51] about where it's like oh my god we do
- [35:52] all the amazing AI that just makes it
- [35:54] all possible at the end of the day it's
- [35:55] humans and us actually going through
- [35:56] with a high degree of confidence and a
- [35:58] high degree of vetting and trust that
- [36:00] actually what's coming in is actually
- [36:01] something we will stamp and we'll
- [36:02] certify and that's what makes it into
- [36:04] our curated catalog. This is part of why
- [36:06] besides you know really the the goal
- [36:08] from us is make it incredibly easy and
- [36:11] low friction for a developer to connect
- [36:13] to you know cursor cloud code or
- [36:15] whatever and work with MCPS and or build
- [36:18] on top of them but also make it safe and
- [36:20] possible for you to work from out of the
- [36:21] registry. So, you know, we're we're it's
- [36:23] an open registry. We try to have anybody
- [36:24] and everybody come in that can work with
- [36:26] us and we, you know, do all the the
- [36:28] vetting like at last scene is in there
- [36:29] and Stripes in there and I don't
- [36:30] remember if there's an arcade dev one
- [36:31] off the top of my head, but you know,
- [36:32] we'd love to have one. So,
- [36:35] >> yeah, there's a lot actually. So, we are
- [36:38] using quite a lot of those actually in
- [36:40] our uh on our end and um yeah, it it
- [36:44] makes it actually quite convenient. Um
- [36:47] so um Alex u how how is uh how are you
- [36:51] guys actually helping this entire
- [36:52] ecosystem right so what uh I mean if you
- [36:55] can give us an idea
- [36:57] >> yeah yeah so the biggest thing that we
- [37:00] do is that we solve the the the off
- [37:04] problem uh the agent off problem and so
- [37:06] if you're trying to build an agent and
- [37:07] you want the agent to interact with some
- [37:10] of these secure systems which is almost
- [37:12] everything Google Ajira Slack
- [37:16] um SAP your own custom APIs. We make it
- [37:20] very easy to build secure uh toolkits
- [37:23] that that the the agent can communicate
- [37:25] with an awful lot of work to. Um and as
- [37:29] part of that, you know, we're very big
- [37:30] believers and contributors to the MCP
- [37:31] spec. Um we just contributed a lot of
- [37:33] our a lot of the way we do it to the
- [37:35] spec. Um and as and as part of that, we
- [37:39] ourselves also build out a lot of these
- [37:42] toolkits. And so we have a large a large
- [37:44] library of pre-built
- [37:47] LLM optimized LLM eval uh tools for all
- [37:51] the major services including Jer just
- [37:53] came out about a month ago. Uh it's
- [37:55] great use it um to make it very easy for
- [37:57] agent developers to just go turn this
- [38:00] stuff on and build whatever it is they
- [38:02] want. Um, and then we have a really nice
- [38:05] SDK so that a developer can very easily
- [38:08] and very quickly build their own
- [38:09] toolkits for what their agent needs that
- [38:12] might consume other downstream services
- [38:15] or just do something for their own
- [38:16] services.
- [38:19] >> So should I expect role based access
- [38:21] coming up coming up with MC?
- [38:23] >> Yes. So we already support role-based
- [38:25] access right now. We support delegated
- [38:27] delegated authorizations. We support and
- [38:29] user based OOTH today. um we we just
- [38:33] don't do it via MCP until the spec can
- [38:35] support it. Uh but we we added that to
- [38:39] the spec along with our partners at
- [38:40] Enthropic and and other companies. Now
- [38:43] we're all just collectively waiting for
- [38:44] that to get merged into the spec. And
- [38:45] once that happens, all of our
- [38:47] functionality around O will also support
- [38:51] MCP. In the short term, until that
- [38:53] happens, we have toolkits that work
- [38:55] without MCP and do all the same work.
- [38:58] Okay. Um so um um I will present this uh
- [39:03] not so hypothetical question right so as
- [39:05] um as someone who's building products uh
- [39:08] and I'm uh I'm someone who is adopting
- [39:10] MCP servers and uh integrating them in
- [39:13] our my agenti workflows. So uh um let's
- [39:17] say I'm the CIO of a company. how should
- [39:20] I decide or um evaluate an MCP product
- [39:25] and what should be my considerations uh
- [39:27] when I bring in uh of course I I cannot
- [39:30] go MCP server by MCP server right so
- [39:33] what would be the best practices of
- [39:35] bringing MCP in my uh in my organization
- [39:42] I know it's a tough one I know that
- [39:44] right so you know because there there's
- [39:46] no there are no books I mean we are
- [39:48] still it's very nent But I'm just
- [39:50] curious uh you know for instance I mean
- [39:53] my first rule internally is it has to be
- [39:56] the official MC MCP server from Docker
- [39:58] and that's that's the first starting
- [40:00] point. So I took the easy one. Uh what
- [40:03] would be the what would be the
- [40:04] recommendation beside this? How how
- [40:06] should a CIO evaluate? Yeah. I mean, I
- [40:08] I'll take the I'll take the opposite
- [40:10] position
- [40:12] kind of back to my earlier point like
- [40:14] the official
- [40:15] >> the official anything MCP server is not
- [40:18] terribly valuable if you're building any
- [40:19] of
- [40:19] >> course. Yeah. Yeah.
- [40:21] >> And so I I I don't even know that that
- [40:24] would work. Um
- [40:26] >> yeah,
- [40:26] >> I would inverse the question and be like
- [40:28] what's the agent you're trying to build
- [40:30] and let's go make sure we get like let's
- [40:33] go it's basic product management. Let's
- [40:34] go figure out what the agent is. just go
- [40:36] figure out how we're going to do it
- [40:37] >> and then and then if an MCP server is
- [40:39] the right answer let's use that if if a
- [40:42] diff you know if A toa or something else
- [40:44] or you know customuilt thing is is the
- [40:47] right thing and let's take that path um
- [40:50] you know I don't I don't yet believe MCP
- [40:53] is we're huge believers in MCP and we
- [40:55] think MCP will be like you know the
- [40:58] thing for everything but it isn't that
- [40:59] yet and I think people people jumping
- [41:04] ahead to where MCP's going to be and
- [41:06] expecting it to be that today is
- [41:08] honestly the biggest headwind to MCP.
- [41:11] Like so much of the negative press is
- [41:13] because people are expecting too much of
- [41:15] a of a of a protocol that's not even a
- [41:17] year old yet. Um and so you know right
- [41:20] tool for the right job.
- [41:25] >> I would say I I will say well agree I
- [41:28] mean at the end of the day I agree and
- [41:29] um I'd even go further. I I I I I spend
- [41:32] even for our own organization, we have a
- [41:33] lot of build versus buy conversations
- [41:35] because everybody is out pitching you
- [41:36] their, you know, every every SAS vendor
- [41:38] is effectively telling you like, oh, I
- [41:39] got an agent now. So, you know, you got
- [41:40] to figure out do I actually think this
- [41:41] is going to be useful or not.
- [41:43] >> But so you agree with Alex actually in
- [41:46] terms of at the end of the day like it's
- [41:48] it's just not that big of a protocol.
- [41:49] It's only your old like I'm whatever I'm
- [41:51] old I've never seen a protocol in my
- [41:52] life go this fast from a blog post to
- [41:55] like everybody on earth uses it and
- [41:57] we're having conferences and panels
- [41:58] about it. Um it is you know you you are
- [42:01] still going to connect it's not
- [42:03] everything Alex said is true you are
- [42:05] still going to need to find them to go
- [42:06] connect to something in which case yeah
- [42:07] the easy button is well start with
- [42:09] docker start with the remotes because at
- [42:10] least you're getting a warranty on those
- [42:12] where they come from and if not for that
- [42:14] then you're basically in kind of like to
- [42:15] Al's point in product management 101 of
- [42:17] and quality assurance 101 of well you're
- [42:19] going to have to in introspect it
- [42:21] understand what it does understand how
- [42:23] it breaks like you know that every every
- [42:25] as I I've been describing to to people
- [42:27] for 30 years of teaching interns and so
- [42:29] on like if it magically works it will
- [42:31] magically break and LLMs are magic in
- [42:33] which case they may magically break an
- [42:35] MCP may magically break and so really
- [42:37] it's on you know it's on you the
- [42:38] organization to understand what it is
- [42:40] you're consuming and understand what the
- [42:42] boundaries are for it and then you can
- [42:44] make an assessment and there's not you
- [42:46] know we at Docker can give you the
- [42:47] shortcut for getting them from at least
- [42:50] an upstream place at least you know
- [42:51] they're trustworthy and they're good
- [42:52] whether they solve your exact problem
- [42:54] not I loved Alex's framing in terms of
- [42:56] errors um cost uh and so on at the
- [42:58] beginning like in terms of your actual
- [43:00] objective goals but at least you can
- [43:02] trust them you know you still have to
- [43:04] you basically have to go through the
- [43:05] same things you've always gone when you
- [43:07] bring in any kind of a technology
- [43:08] whether it's MCP or just generic open
- [43:10] source or a third party vendor which is
- [43:12] do I understand what it does am I going
- [43:13] to get value from it and do I trust it
- [43:15] and have I actually quality done some
- [43:17] level of acceptance testing that it
- [43:19] meets what I want as an organization
- [43:22] >> that's that's great thanks Mark um so um
- [43:26] so there was this uh report that was
- [43:28] news uh from uh MIT that only 95% of
- [43:32] investments in AI that result in 95%
- [43:36] actually result in zero ROI and only 5%
- [43:39] actually uh provide any meaningful
- [43:42] business value and uh um I think one of
- [43:46] the reasons among many other things I
- [43:48] mean it's it's far more complex than uh
- [43:50] this that but one of the one of the
- [43:53] complexity in building these agentic
- [43:55] systems is uh well uh getting the right
- [43:58] context at the right time uh and
- [44:00] correctly
- [44:02] uh and uh lack of standardization silo
- [44:04] data sources and all of that right do
- [44:06] you think uh that characterization that
- [44:09] assessment is correct among many other
- [44:12] things and do do we think that MCP is
- [44:14] going to help in this case or is it
- [44:16] going to hurt right so maybe people are
- [44:19] going to become more cautious and hey I
- [44:21] mean we don't want to deal with this
- [44:23] right so Reena you want to go ahead and
- [44:26] uh maybe what's your take on this
- [44:28] >> definitely. So um that was such a
- [44:30] fascinating report. I was like really
- [44:32] really I'm first of all I'm just very
- [44:35] very grateful for the insights that they
- [44:36] provided the depth of findings that
- [44:38] they've gone into. Um and of course like
- [44:40] I think uh I suspect you know it's a
- [44:43] little more stark than what probably the
- [44:45] reality is but it's good to have I think
- [44:47] the a little bit of kind of you know
- [44:49] cold water on all of the uh the high
- [44:51] expectations that we've had on AI for a
- [44:53] bit. So uh coming to kind of you know
- [44:55] your question on what what I think about
- [44:58] kind of you know where things are
- [44:59] heading and how uh maybe in the context
- [45:01] of this particular question or with this
- [45:04] particular panel here as to how is MCP
- [45:06] going to kind of help help with this
- [45:08] space or not. I definitely think that
- [45:10] you know I'll go back to what Alex said
- [45:12] a huge plus one to that which is that
- [45:13] first of all I think what we haven't
- [45:15] been able to do in the AI space really
- [45:17] is understand what are those hero use
- [45:19] cases what is this you know working
- [45:21] backwards from the customer or the user
- [45:23] of these which is you know the knowledge
- [45:24] worker and most of these enterprises
- [45:26] what do they really kind of you know
- [45:28] want and care for and how where is the
- [45:30] product market fit right now like today
- [45:32] with the agentic systems that we can
- [45:34] provide them and uh this is where I
- [45:37] think the uh of course the MCP can be a
- [45:39] very rich set of tools that we can give
- [45:42] to the agentic systems to then help
- [45:44] those solve those problems. And I think
- [45:46] the fact that uh the MCP makes these
- [45:48] much more kind of you know discrete and
- [45:50] easy to understand more deterministic in
- [45:52] their flows solve some of the quality
- [45:55] assurance and of course provides a
- [45:57] little bit more guardrails around
- [45:58] security if we add them to the mix a
- [46:01] little more. I do think that there are
- [46:03] ways for us to be able to solve some
- [46:05] more of the customer use cases problems
- [46:08] and really kind of you know getting into
- [46:10] the reliability pieces getting into the
- [46:12] quality pieces getting into the
- [46:13] understanding of really where the user
- [46:15] use cases are. So I think if we were to
- [46:18] kind of for our customers do better with
- [46:20] understanding their use cases and then
- [46:22] being able to you know bring the right
- [46:24] tools for the right uh uh for the right
- [46:27] problems we'll be able to get much
- [46:28] faster into the adoption and the usage
- [46:31] of these agent systems. I think we are
- [46:33] still kind of groping our wares around
- [46:35] for various of these uh installations
- [46:37] unfortunately today. Yeah. So Reena, so
- [46:39] if I understood correctly, so it is
- [46:41] basically not having well- definfined
- [46:44] use cases. uh and um so we'll need a lot
- [46:48] of uh very technical talented product
- [46:50] managers then who can
- [46:52] >> yeah I think I think it's it's a
- [46:53] question of really marrying the use
- [46:56] cases and where the users are at
- [46:58] bringing them along the journey and
- [47:00] bringing the tools that match their kind
- [47:02] of you know use cases and their
- [47:04] requirements and really MCPS can help
- [47:06] with that because we do kind of you know
- [47:08] then pro able to provide them those
- [47:10] specific tools those specific kind of
- [47:12] you know understanding while leveraging
- [47:14] ing all of the kind of you know really
- [47:16] great smarts from the agentic AI spaces
- [47:19] of you know being understanding the
- [47:21] inference and you know understanding the
- [47:22] context bringing the context along both
- [47:24] in the user space as well as from
- [47:26] multiple other sources uh to the same
- [47:29] agent in the same in the same session.
- [47:33] >> Thanks Reena Mark Alex do you want to
- [47:36] add anything to it? Sure. I'm I'm full
- [47:38] of hot and snarky takes. So basically if
- [47:41] you take um the report on AI everything
- [47:45] said like I agree with by the way. Um
- [47:46] but if you take that report from MIT the
- [47:48] 95% of people get zero value. Um if if
- [47:51] you just I I'll draw a comparison. If
- [47:53] you just start with just developers and
- [47:54] I'll come back to the business view of
- [47:56] all AI in a second. Um for my entire
- [47:58] career watch people try to measure
- [48:00] developer productivity and largely you
- [48:02] know fail at it basically where it's
- [48:03] like oh we have all these metrics we
- [48:04] have the door. the space we have all
- [48:06] these things that we go do and at the
- [48:08] end of the day it's incredibly hard and
- [48:10] subjective to figure that out and so
- [48:11] it's like hard to figure out have you
- [48:13] actually moved the needle on developer
- [48:14] productivity inside an organization from
- [48:17] an ROI perspective of like whatever you
- [48:19] brought in and you kind of like it's
- [48:20] like I subjectively know like oh this
- [48:21] was better this was not and I got some
- [48:22] metrics that may or may not line up to
- [48:24] that but so from an AI um in whether the
- [48:28] right number is 95% or not I don't know
- [48:30] but in that paper what I particularly
- [48:31] loved was the shadow there's a call out
- [48:33] but the shadow effectively the where it
- [48:34] succeeds ing is the shadow organizations
- [48:37] that are basically the people that are
- [48:38] off close to the close to the actual
- [48:40] problem thinking hard about it and then
- [48:42] just kind of doing their own thing in
- [48:44] the weeds and they come back with
- [48:46] something that actually solved the
- [48:47] business problem because when you go to
- [48:49] do I find that number kind of believable
- [48:51] like I do at the end of the day because
- [48:52] I think if we can't articulate very well
- [48:54] what ROI is on a development
- [48:56] organization and everybody struggles
- [48:58] with this most businesses I think
- [49:00] especially from a productivity
- [49:01] productivity is very hard to measure and
- [49:02] manage from an actual productivity
- [49:05] measure just any function whether it's
- [49:06] HR, sales, accounting, whatever it is,
- [49:09] it's incredibly hard and so you're just
- [49:11] like pouring money into AI hoping for
- [49:13] some magic to come back and it's really
- [49:15] the cases where the people understand
- [49:17] what the pain point is and what the
- [49:18] value is that have actually solved it
- [49:19] and so my suspicion is it's better than
- [49:21] 5%. But from if you're looking at it
- [49:23] from like a board level view, probably
- [49:25] that actually number is pretty accurate
- [49:26] to what I would imagine is actually
- [49:28] happening. But you know, the truth is
- [49:29] somewhere in the middle
- [49:31] >> and you can never make the board happy,
- [49:33] right? So I mean you have to keep doing
- [49:34] more, right? So yeah.
- [49:36] >> Yeah. Um okay, Alex, you want to add
- [49:38] something?
- [49:39] >> Yeah. You know, we're we're in the field
- [49:41] all day with customers that are actively
- [49:43] like have staffed and budgeted agent
- [49:46] building teams. Um, and so from from
- [49:48] that from that perch, um, you know, I
- [49:52] don't know what the number is, but it's
- [49:53] directionally correct. We see a lot of
- [49:54] failed projects and killed projects. So,
- [49:56] I'll use that as the metric. Um, it's
- [49:59] actually a it's a very finite set of
- [50:01] reasons why these projects fail. It's uh
- [50:04] the costs were just untenable because
- [50:06] they were using the token weight. They
- [50:07] were using just tokens too much. So, the
- [50:09] LLM costs were were uneconomical for
- [50:11] what they were trying to build. latency
- [50:13] was just similarly just unachievable. It
- [50:18] was just too long uh for user time to
- [50:20] wait that long. And then um the third
- [50:23] one was the accuracy rates weren't high
- [50:25] enough. Um in a demo you can get
- [50:26] something really cool working but if you
- [50:28] can't get it above like 80 something%
- [50:30] consistency, no one will use it in
- [50:32] production. You can release it but no
- [50:34] one will adopt it. And then oh and then
- [50:36] there's a fourth which is security kills
- [50:38] it. Um, so we see we see some
- [50:40] combination of those happening to the
- [50:42] majority projects we see in the field.
- [50:44] Um, and and MCP isn't isn't part of the
- [50:48] solution, frankly. Not because it's bad.
- [50:50] It's just it's just a protocol, right?
- [50:52] It's it's not like a white horse. The
- [50:55] problem is multi-layered. Part of it is
- [50:57] talent. Like very few people know how to
- [51:00] build agents today. And so they're
- [51:02] running into a lot of basic problems.
- [51:04] Nobody knows how to do evals as an
- [51:05] example. Um the second one is there are
- [51:08] security real security issues uh around
- [51:11] authorization around safety etc people
- [51:13] are trying to figure out and then uh but
- [51:16] I do think that MCP represents a body of
- [51:20] work that is part of the solution which
- [51:22] is tool use and uh but I'll remind the
- [51:25] audience that MCP is a protocol for tool
- [51:27] use it is not itself
- [51:30] tool use or tools.
- [51:33] Thanks Alex. We are actually over time.
- [51:36] I will take take a look at um probably
- [51:39] we can answer two questions from here.
- [51:42] So I will just quickly scan through. Um
- [51:45] so I will take this one. Rolling out MCP
- [51:48] or wide. Uh what's your nobrainer
- [51:50] guardrail stack and how do you keep dev
- [51:53] speed by up? So basically I think the
- [51:55] question is around what kind of
- [51:56] guardrails you would put around MCP uh
- [52:00] uh and uh how do you keep up how do you
- [52:04] stay compliant?
- [52:07] >> I feel like this is a this is a gimme
- [52:08] for Alex and I where it's like well the
- [52:10] two things I would imagine you clearly
- [52:11] want to roll out as Docker and
- [52:12] Arcade.dev both of whom are actually
- [52:14] solving a whole lot of MCP governance
- [52:16] problems. Um but to some extent that's
- [52:19] kind of a serious answer to some extent.
- [52:20] Um, you know, there's not I don't think
- [52:22] we're I don't think this is anywhere
- [52:23] near mature enough yet where we can all
- [52:25] look at it like it's like, you know, it
- [52:27] the I'm going to date myself here, but
- [52:29] it's the equivalent of the LAMP stack
- [52:30] where we all agree that's the exact, you
- [52:32] know, right um configuration of things.
- [52:35] A lot of this is still, you know,
- [52:37] there's evals are this very basic narrow
- [52:40] thing for prompts, but then really you
- [52:41] need overall observability of the whole
- [52:43] platform. And like we're just not there
- [52:44] yet, frankly, in terms of something that
- [52:46] where everything end to end works
- [52:47] across, you know, supply chain and
- [52:49] discovery through building through
- [52:51] deployment through like just it's just
- [52:53] it's just not there. And I think it's
- [52:54] it's you're you're we're living in the
- [52:56] world of the point of that that that
- [52:58] paper. It's the shadow. It's the shadow
- [53:01] IT or the shadow organizations that are
- [53:02] doing this and they're kind of like wild
- [53:04] west putting together what they need
- [53:05] from a bunch of different places because
- [53:06] the space is just moving so fast. So
- [53:09] that said, I think Docker and Arcade.dev
- [53:10] are both solving very meaningful
- [53:11] problems for people and we will help.
- [53:13] >> Yeah. And but actually I think you have
- [53:15] the you have the right panel for it
- [53:16] because as much as as much as we can
- [53:19] solve things like delegated
- [53:20] authorization like we can only do what
- [53:24] the downstream service like an Atlassian
- [53:27] has exposed at its policy layer and so
- [53:30] if you know if you're a SAS vendor and
- [53:32] want people to use you and your agentic
- [53:34] flows in a secure fashion or you
- [53:36] yourself are trying to expose part of
- [53:39] your own functionality uh for your own
- [53:42] agents to consume the policy layer,
- [53:45] arbach, abbach, whatever, what you know,
- [53:48] contextual access management, all of
- [53:50] that stuff, it actually needs to live in
- [53:54] those services that you want the agent
- [53:56] to talk to. You do not want to create an
- [53:58] intermediate layer for this stuff
- [54:00] because then you're going to end up with
- [54:01] identity silos and those don't work at
- [54:04] all. Like that you will create more
- [54:06] problems than you'll solve. And so it's
- [54:09] it's it's it's like the work that
- [54:11] Lassian's doing and Mongo's doing and
- [54:13] and other people are doing. It's having
- [54:16] richer policies available to lock this
- [54:19] stuff down so services like Docker and
- [54:21] Arcade can best enforce.
- [54:25] >> And thank you Alex. Uh we are way over
- [54:29] time so I will uh I will close with one
- [54:31] last question. I will go around and uh
- [54:32] all of you can answer this. What are you
- [54:35] what are you most excited about? in the
- [54:38] context of whatever you're building at
- [54:39] Atlassian maybe Reena you can go first
- [54:41] and Docker and then Arcade.
- [54:45] Yeah, I think I'm I'm just like
- [54:47] specifically in the context of MCP
- [54:48] servers, probably just most exciting for
- [54:50] me is the collaborative agentic
- [54:52] workflows that we can be building
- [54:54] across, you know, multiple different SAS
- [54:56] tools at this point. And how do we get
- [54:58] our users to get so much more value
- [55:00] outside of kind of you know just the
- [55:02] Atlassian boundaries so that they can
- [55:04] then be using not just you know
- [55:05] Atlassian tool sets but actually
- [55:07] connecting all of their system of work
- [55:09] that they have today whether that be
- [55:10] email be slack be um you know their uh
- [55:13] salesforce or other kind of you know
- [55:15] ways to manage their campaigns and uh
- [55:18] create content and so on. So really kind
- [55:19] of you know how do we become more and
- [55:21] more uh available to our builders and
- [55:25] the knowledge workers so that they kind
- [55:27] of you know are able to leverage all of
- [55:29] these agentic workflows that are coming
- [55:30] across in a collaborative way and in a
- [55:32] way that are totally secure and you know
- [55:34] follow the uh follow much more of their
- [55:37] kind of you know where they want to take
- [55:38] their lives and their systems.
- [55:41] >> Thank you. Yeah Mark
- [55:42] >> I can go next. Yeah I um uh sort of
- [55:46] similar at the end of the day we're an
- [55:48] app dev company. We're kind of a DevOps
- [55:49] company. We help people build and
- [55:51] package apps and get them to prod. And I
- [55:52] think what I'm most excited about is
- [55:55] doing for agents what we did for
- [55:56] microservices, right? You know, I think
- [55:58] really Docker basically made like the
- [56:00] modern era of cloud native ultimately by
- [56:02] being container native possible by
- [56:03] helping people factor things down and
- [56:05] then actually have flows around that.
- [56:07] And at the end of the day, we have a lot
- [56:08] of stuff we're doing around security and
- [56:10] governance and management and deployment
- [56:12] and all the rest for MCP. And
- [56:13] fundamentally what I think is most
- [56:15] exciting is, you know, as as people get
- [56:17] through this first wave of having a
- [56:18] whole lot of agentic projects fail, we
- [56:21] will get there. And I deeply believe
- [56:23] Edward will figure out I have to spend a
- [56:25] lot more time than I think I have to
- [56:26] spend using something like what Reena
- [56:28] built, building it my own logic on top
- [56:30] of that that suits my business need and
- [56:32] then packaging that up as applications.
- [56:34] And I think, you know, we at Docker are
- [56:37] this is this is kind of what we do is
- [56:38] kind of our jam. So I'm I'm excited
- [56:40] about the new world as we evolve
- [56:42] forward.
- [56:43] of uh I'm super excited because uh we've
- [56:47] been talking about models models models
- [56:49] models for the last you know two years
- [56:51] and the models are now good enough and
- [56:54] uh the real problems the real
- [56:56] bottlenecks in agent development are now
- [56:58] what can the models actually do what can
- [56:59] the agents do with all of this
- [57:01] intelligence and the answer to that
- [57:03] question is tool use and that's what
- [57:07] we're enabling along with MCP and so uh
- [57:10] I'm super excited to be to be helping to
- [57:12] drive that
- [57:14] Okay. Um, thanks uh, Alex, Mark and
- [57:16] Reena. Thank you so much um,
- [57:19] >> for having us.
- [57:20] >> I I would love to continue the
- [57:22] conversation but we are approaching the
- [57:23] next uh, next panel, right? So we'll we
- [57:26] going to take a five minute break and
- [57:27] then we'll come back. Thanks everyone.
- [57:30] Okay, bye.
- [57:31] >> Thanks everybody.
- [57:32] >> Thank you.
