- [00:01] Hi everyone, my name is Francis,
- [00:03] co-founder of AHA. Over the past few
- [00:05] months, we've been building something a
- [00:07] little bit crazy. An AI employee for
- [00:09] Amazon marketing that works around the
- [00:11] clock 247
- [00:13] from finding the right influencers and
- [00:15] reaching out to negotiating the price,
- [00:17] setting down contracts, and even
- [00:19] handling payments. It can run the entire
- [00:21] infant marketing for you. The same one
- [00:24] that used to be long, messy, and
- [00:26] painfully repetitive. I'm guessing some
- [00:29] of you might be wondering right now, can
- [00:32] we really trust AI for MS marketing? I
- [00:35] know that sounds almost like would you
- [00:37] trust AI to help you fall in love?
- [00:40] Because Amazon marketing has been always
- [00:43] about people, feelings, relationships,
- [00:46] and those sparks that happen in a
- [00:48] negotiation.
- [00:49] Every message, every quote, every vision
- [00:52] is built on countless people and
- [00:54] countless hours of work.
- [00:57] I don't know how many of you have gone
- [00:59] through the pain of finding the right
- [01:01] creators or agencies or you finally
- [01:04] discover some like a good fit but you
- [01:06] can't agree on pricing
- [01:09] and you are never sure how much room
- [01:10] there is to negotiate or maybe you
- [01:13] finally agree on the price and budget
- [01:16] and start moving forward. But then even
- [01:19] more time you spend on back and forth
- [01:21] communications about contracting and
- [01:23] everything pushing tiny details for
- [01:25] days.
- [01:27] All those little steps and follow-ups,
- [01:30] they can honestly drive you crazy. But
- [01:33] what what if I tell you you can hand
- [01:35] that to AHA? Sounds tempting, doesn't
- [01:38] it? But today, I'm not here to tell you
- [01:41] how smart AA is. I want to tell you I
- [01:44] want to show you that what happens when
- [01:48] it's really working.
- [01:50] Over the four months, we've been working
- [01:52] with over 300 brands making a real part
- [01:56] of their infrastru
- [01:59] we turn their like real experience into
- [02:01] a video as well. Now picture this a real
- [02:05] test of speed and outcome for Amazon
- [02:08] marketing. So on on one side there are
- [02:10] five experts for Amazon marketing for
- [02:12] years and on the other a junior marketer
- [02:15] with his partner AI partner Aha. Same
- [02:19] brief same budget and same goal. What
- [02:23] who would you trust to win?
- [02:26] Before we begin, I'd like to invite
- [02:28] everyone to watch the screen and scan
- [02:30] the QR code. Grab your phone and vote
- [02:33] for the team you trust.
- [02:36] This isn't just a vote.
- [02:38] It's a small it's a small act of
- [02:40] imagination for all of us of the future
- [02:43] we all want to build.
- [02:46] And of course, no matter which side
- [02:48] you're on, everyone who votes and enter
- [02:51] a valid email will receive a trust
- [02:53] reward from us. Don't forget to check
- [02:55] your email after the session.
- [02:58] We've also prepared 150
- [03:03] limited edition big orange bag for you.
- [03:07] So don't forget to get it um at a booth
- [03:10] and for after the session.
- [03:12] From the moment you vote, you'll not
- [03:15] only see where the majority stands, but
- [03:17] also see how close technology is to
- [03:19] crossing the line from making ideas to
- [03:22] real world impact. And today, each one
- [03:25] of you is helping to bring that moment a
- [03:27] little bit closer.
- [03:29] Ready? Let's begin.
- [03:34] For decades, influencer marketing has
- [03:37] been powered by instinct, by networks,
- [03:40] and human negotiation. But what happens
- [03:43] when one AI claims it can do it all
- [03:46] faster, smarter, and at scale? Six
- [03:50] marketers accepted the $1 million
- [03:52] challenge. The first group, five elite
- [03:55] veterans, marketers from top agencies.
- [03:57] And the other, Sam, 25. He'll be working
- [04:01] with Aha, the marketing AI agent.
- [04:09] >> Let the challenge begin in three, two,
- [04:14] one.
- [04:17] >> All right, we've got the three. Let's
- [04:18] break it down into keywords
- [04:19] [clears throat] and start using that
- [04:20] tool that you use to find influencers.
- [04:22] Let's do 200 per person per day.
- [04:25] >> Sounds good. If we each pull 200 a day,
- [04:27] in about 5 days, we'll have our first
- [04:30] pool of influencers.
- [04:31] >> Once we've got them, each of us replies
- [04:32] to the ones they found, handle the
- [04:34] conversation and pricing until
- [04:35] everything's confirmed.
- [04:36] >> I'm with you.
- [04:47] >> Campaign launched. Estimated influencer
- [04:49] delivery 24 to 48 hours.
- [04:52] >> Hi guys, good news. I just reached out
- [04:54] to two influencers we've worked with
- [04:55] before. They'll join this campaign, too.
- [04:58] We got this.
- [05:01] Okay.
- [05:11] Oh, please, please.
- [05:14] >> Match complete. 5,080 qualified asterisk
- [05:18] influencers found. 128 confirmed
- [05:21] asterisk partnerships established.
- [05:23] >> Unbelievable. Let's go.
- [05:27] >> What? How did Sam jump to 128? [music] I
- [05:30] mean, I don't think that's reasonable.
- [05:31] Did they even check to see if the
- [05:33] influencers fit or did they just pull
- [05:34] them from social media?
- [05:35] >> How could they negotiate pricing with
- [05:37] that many people in such a short time?
- [05:39] >> We're raising an objection. They'll need
- [05:41] to verify those results. There's no way
- [05:43] those numbers are real. How could one
- [05:45] guy in AI get that? We need content
- [05:49] ready ASAP. Could you deliver by Friday?
- [06:00] >> Warning issued. Credit system review
- [06:03] initiated. Payment safeguarded.
- [06:07] Delivery completed.
- [06:09] >> We value your work, but the timeline is
- [06:11] fixed. Let's make it happen.
- [06:14] >> I promise it.
- [06:15] >> [laughter]
- [06:21] >> Reports delivered.
- [06:26] >> Congratulations to you, the human
- [06:29] marketing team. Your presence today
- [06:31] proves one thing. Experience matters.
- [06:35] And as for you, Sam, at first everyone
- [06:38] doubted those 128 influencers, but after
- [06:41] the audit, every one of them checked
- [06:43] out. All relevant, all verified with
- [06:46] AHA. You've created something
- [06:49] remarkable.
- [06:50] >> I never [music] thought I could do all
- [06:51] this. Just Just me and AI.
- [06:54] >> You made that and that's what you
- [06:56] deserve.
- [07:04] All right. Actually, the win isn't just
- [07:07] about what happened in the video on
- [07:09] stage. In the real world, AHA has helped
- [07:12] more than 300 brands win their markets.
- [07:15] From AI, SAS, application companies to
- [07:17] fast growing DTC brands, making tens of
- [07:20] millions in annual revenue. They've all
- [07:23] made a ha part of their influence
- [07:25] marketing team working alongside the
- [07:27] team all the time. And these early
- [07:29] clients are share something in common.
- [07:32] They are techdriven, result oriented and
- [07:35] bold enough to try new stuff.
- [07:38] The reason why a hab became part of
- [07:39] their workflow so quickly is because we
- [07:42] understand the group and we are this
- [07:45] group. We know what they need, what they
- [07:47] fear and we know they have zero
- [07:50] tolerance for wasting time.
- [07:53] Let me share some real uh uh use cases.
- [07:56] So the first one is only office. Oni
- [07:59] office is open source office software
- [08:02] company from Europe with a global team
- [08:04] of about 100 people around 30 countries.
- [08:08] Their product is powerful but they feel
- [08:10] like their marketing workflow need an
- [08:12] upgrade manual creator screening and as
- [08:15] back and forth communications slow
- [08:17] feedback and long campaign cycles. After
- [08:21] working with AHA, the system
- [08:22] automatically handled creator matching,
- [08:25] pricing, brief generation, and
- [08:26] performance tracking. In just a few
- [08:29] weeks, their content reach professional
- [08:31] audience around the globe.
- [08:34] So, here are their results. Over
- [08:36] 400,000K
- [08:38] or 400K um views at around CPC 70 cents
- [08:43] and campaign cycles shorten from months
- [08:45] to just weeks.
- [08:47] When brands really see results faster,
- [08:50] they can find their growth direction
- [08:52] faster. What a hot deal for only office
- [08:55] isn't more marketing. It was turning
- [08:58] every campaign into a clear piece of
- [09:00] market feedback.
- [09:03] Next use case, Metagbt.
- [09:05] So Metagbt is a global leader in AI
- [09:08] innovation. They've been asking a simple
- [09:11] but powerful question. if AI can really
- [09:15] code and build applications for people.
- [09:18] After a influence marketing looked like
- [09:21] most other tech companies, lots of heavy
- [09:24] lifting, manual work. It was slow, full
- [09:26] of trial and error and every direction
- [09:28] took forever
- [09:30] after working with AHA. Everything
- [09:32] changed
- [09:34] for creator selection and matching. So
- [09:36] AI automatically identify the most
- [09:38] relevant creators from a pool of over 5
- [09:40] million. and for pricing and budget
- [09:42] optimization. So the system calculate
- [09:44] the estim CPM and dynamically adjust it
- [09:47] based on demand and supply
- [09:48] relationships. And last but not least
- [09:51] execution and communications.
- [09:53] So the system AI generated brief monitor
- [09:57] content pre performance and
- [09:59] automatically handle the payment. The
- [10:01] entire campaign from concept to launch
- [10:03] just took two weeks and here are their u
- [10:07] results. So they shorten campaign from
- [10:09] several months to two weeks and reach
- [10:12] impression at 1 million over 1 million
- [10:15] and their CPC was only about 50 cents.
- [10:19] For companies like Meta GBT which are
- [10:21] extremely sensitive to efficiency and
- [10:23] results AI isn't just about automating a
- [10:26] few tasks. It's about making the entire
- [10:29] emphasis marketing process controllable,
- [10:31] measurable and scalable. And that's the
- [10:34] new trend. We are seeing us seeing a
- [10:37] shift from human managing humans to AI
- [10:40] managing growth
- [10:43] from gut feeling decisions to continue
- [10:45] the cycle of datadriven optimization.
- [10:49] Third case, collab. Collab is an
- [10:51] innovative DIY brand making rock uh like
- [10:56] making rock toughing gun. So anyone like
- [10:59] creators um like a hobbyist even
- [11:02] teachers can make rocks right from home.
- [11:04] Before using AHA things were tough. Out
- [11:08] of every 50 outreach emails they got
- [11:10] just one reply and it took a nearly 50
- [11:13] days from first contact to video going
- [11:16] live and there was plenty exposure but
- [11:19] very few conversions. Data was scattered
- [11:22] everywhere. Then a heart stepped in. It
- [11:26] took everything from creators
- [11:28] negotiating prices, tracking results all
- [11:30] automatically.
- [11:32] So what we did first automatic matching
- [11:35] we precisely targeted creators in DIY
- [11:37] and home living niches. Automated
- [11:40] communication and pricing. So we
- [11:42] minimize back and forth delays for the
- [11:45] team and real-time talking which is also
- [11:47] very important. Campaign data is visible
- [11:49] to the team instantly.
- [11:53] So their final results are were
- [11:55] dramatic. So they reduced their time 82%
- [11:59] and reach a CPC at only 50 cents.
- [12:03] The team was freed from endless
- [12:05] coordination and reporting and their
- [12:07] product went viral in the DIY community.
- [12:10] Their team told us the biggest
- [12:11] improvement is efficiency. Now that our
- [12:14] videos go live within two weeks, we can
- [12:17] finally focus on product itself.
- [12:20] And this is only the beginning. When AI
- [12:23] becomes accountable for real results,
- [12:25] the rules of infant broking are
- [12:26] rewritten.
- [12:28] Now let's take a look at how a actually
- [12:30] makes that happen.
- [12:33] So uh let's take a quick quiz. So for
- [12:38] which one do you think would perform
- [12:39] better for promoting an AI product? A is
- [12:42] a creator who regularly posts AI news
- [12:44] and B is one who mostly reviews smart
- [12:47] hardware and only mentions AI
- [12:49] occasionally.
- [12:50] So raise your hand if you think it's A.
- [12:56] Actually the answer was B.
- [13:02] Surprisingly the W winner was B. The
- [13:05] hardware reviewer that campaign
- [13:07] collaborating collaborating with the
- [13:09] hardware reviewer blew up. Why? Because
- [13:13] the HA algorithm doesn't just look at
- [13:15] who talks about AI. It it looks at whose
- [13:18] audience would actually resonate by that
- [13:20] product message. We call it profile
- [13:23] package mapping algorithm. It doesn't
- [13:26] rely on service level attacks. It relies
- [13:28] on semantic understanding and audience
- [13:30] reasoning.
- [13:32] Traditional information marketing works
- [13:34] by tags. The brain says find AI
- [13:36] creators. So the team searches for the
- [13:38] AI tag. So everyone ends up finding the
- [13:40] same people popular, expensive, and
- [13:42] overused.
- [13:44] But variety doesn't come from feelings.
- [13:47] It come from testing. And infant
- [13:49] marketing is a numbers game. You need
- [13:51] diversity and volume to discover those
- [13:53] unexpected combinations. The ones that
- [13:56] don't look obvious but perform the best.
- [14:00] That campaign worked exactly like this.
- [14:02] AI news creators went viral only when
- [14:04] the product was brand new. But that
- [14:07] hardware reviewer broke down the
- [14:08] functions, show real case use case uh
- [14:10] real real use cases and help this
- [14:12] audience his audience understand why
- [14:15] this tool mattered to them. A hus model
- [14:18] doesn't just decide which creator fits
- [14:20] best. It also analyze which content
- [14:22] style fits the campaign. It asks itself
- [14:26] can this content structure integrate the
- [14:28] brand message naturally?
- [14:30] Will this way of explaining things spark
- [14:32] real impact?
- [14:34] And the result AI picked the right
- [14:37] creator with the right kind of content.
- [14:42] A house model doesn't just look at
- [14:44] people. It evaluates content. It
- [14:46] understand brand goals, creator styles,
- [14:48] audience semantics and content foot and
- [14:51] what it makes judgments like a real
- [14:53] marketing expert.
- [14:56] It figure out what combination of
- [14:58] audience and content has the highest
- [14:59] potential to go viral. We spent a full
- [15:02] year rewriting more than 10 versions to
- [15:05] build what we call agentled reasoning
- [15:08] matching system.
- [15:10] It achieves over 90% accuracy cuts CPM
- [15:14] cost by 1.5 times and ses times over
- [15:16] 70%.
- [15:18] So what you're here what you're seeing
- [15:20] here isn't just an algorithm. It's a AI
- [15:23] matching agent that thinks like
- [15:25] strategist
- [15:27] cast like a director and tells the right
- [15:29] story to your right audience.
- [15:33] Let's play another game. So imagine you
- [15:35] are a brand looking for a creator to
- [15:37] make a video. The creator costs 10,000
- [15:40] and how much do you think the brand will
- [15:42] end up paying?
- [15:44] There are four options. A less than 10
- [15:46] thou 10,000. B exactly 10,000. C a bit
- [15:49] more around 15,000. And D a lot more
- [15:52] over 20,000.
- [15:55] So the actual answer is all the why
- [15:59] because
- [16:01] there's no right answer right now.
- [16:03] Everyone has their own logic and
- [16:05] reasoning for pricing in market
- [16:06] influencers
- [16:08] price are never fixed and transparent.
- [16:11] They are the result of feelings and
- [16:13] negotiations.
- [16:15] Some brands negotiate them down. Some
- [16:17] got markup. Some prices balloon because
- [16:20] of multi- layers of agency fees. Some
- [16:23] creators overpriced themselves and of
- [16:25] course some undervalued.
- [16:28] No one really knows the fair prices and
- [16:32] that's exactly the problem.
- [16:35] The entire industry still runs on
- [16:36] negotiations, connections and god
- [16:39] feelings. Every single day deal feels
- [16:42] like a beating at an auction.
- [16:44] So at a wei decided to disrupt that
- [16:47] disrupt the status quo. We turn pricing
- [16:50] from human negotiations and hidden fees
- [16:53] into an algorithm
- [16:55] system. That's our dynamic pricing
- [16:58] engine, an algorithm driven market
- [17:00] economy that reacts to the market
- [17:02] changes in real time and automatically
- [17:04] finds the optimal price for you.
- [17:07] It's an intelligent agent that
- [17:09] understands economics. It consider three
- [17:13] key factors.
- [17:14] The first factor is audience value for
- [17:17] the brand and past performance of the
- [17:19] creators. The second is brand goals and
- [17:21] budget. And third is market signals
- [17:24] which is supply and demand relationship.
- [17:28] When a certain calory heats up the
- [17:30] system automatically adjust prices and
- [17:33] what when the market cools down or
- [17:34] budget tighten, it optimize ROI in real
- [17:37] time.
- [17:40] And that means for the first time
- [17:43] pricing infant marketing has shifted
- [17:45] from human negotiation to equivalent
- [17:49] algorithm. By embedding market mechanism
- [17:52] into algorithm itself, we've built a
- [17:54] pricing system that's transparent,
- [17:56] predictable and economically structured.
- [18:01] So one large question, what percentage
- [18:03] of marketing managers have ever
- [18:05] experienced this like paid but never
- [18:08] received any content from the creator?
- [18:10] And what percentage of creators posted
- [18:12] the content but never got paid? A is 5%,
- [18:17] B is 20%, C is 40% and D is more than
- [18:21] 70%.
- [18:28] And the answer is actually D. More than
- [18:31] 70% of brands and creators have been
- [18:33] hurting a system that's not like
- [18:36] regulated and transparent.
- [18:39] Everyone relies on spreadsheets,
- [18:42] screenshots, and waiting.
- [18:45] Brands don't trust creators. Creators
- [18:47] don't trust brands. So, we ask ourselves
- [18:50] in the case AI can make pricing
- [18:52] transparent and matching standardized.
- [18:55] Can it also make trust automatic?
- [18:58] At AHA, every collaboration is fully
- [19:01] tracked by the system. Algorithm based
- [19:04] pricing, automatic contract generation,
- [19:07] real-time progress tracking and resolver
- [19:09] verification of auto and auto payment.
- [19:12] If the content isn't delivered, false
- [19:14] review, and the data is fake, you don't
- [19:17] have to pay. There's no payment. But
- [19:20] once it passes, payment happens
- [19:22] instantly for you. For the first time,
- [19:24] in marketing finally has a true closed
- [19:26] loop of results.
- [19:29] In the past, trust depends on people and
- [19:32] it was fragile. At AHA, we're making
- [19:35] trust systematic,
- [19:37] stable, transparent, and built to last.
- [19:42] This is what we want to prove. AI isn't
- [19:45] just another tool. It's a mayor. It's a
- [19:47] new layer of business infrastructure
- [19:49] that we are transforming traditional
- [19:51] infant marketing from something complex,
