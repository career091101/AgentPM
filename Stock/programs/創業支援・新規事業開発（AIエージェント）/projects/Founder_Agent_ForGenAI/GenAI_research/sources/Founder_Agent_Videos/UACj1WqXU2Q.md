- [00:00] Did you know that Google has a brand new
- [00:02] no code AI automation platform that's
- [00:05] powered by Gemini state-of-the-art
- [00:06] model? One that lets you automate entire
- [00:09] workflows just by describing them in
- [00:11] natural language. It's called Google
- [00:13] Flows, and it lets you connect to Gmail,
- [00:16] Drive, Chat, Calendar, Forms, and even
- [00:19] customize AI agents into one intelligent
- [00:22] end-to-end automation system. With
- [00:25] Flows, you're essentially automating
- [00:26] your work with AI agents. It was built
- [00:29] to eliminate repetitive tasks between
- [00:31] workspace apps using plain English
- [00:34] instructions. You can combine starters,
- [00:36] conditions, actions, and functions.
- [00:39] Plus, Gemini's reasoning to research,
- [00:41] summarize, analyze, and even generate
- [00:43] content, or trigger multi-step processes
- [00:46] across your entire organization. Think
- [00:49] of it like a make alternative, but
- [00:51] powered by Google's own AI with deep
- [00:53] contextual understanding baked in. It
- [00:56] doesn't just run steps, it understands
- [00:58] them. And two weeks ago, Google had just
- [01:01] introduced the front end for flows where
- [01:03] you can easily automate your work by
- [01:05] simply describing a prompt to the Gemini
- [01:08] model for it to create the automation
- [01:10] for you. And this is where you can
- [01:12] automate various sorts of things with
- [01:14] Google's suite of tools. And these
- [01:16] agents can automate the ability to send
- [01:19] out emails, set up events, meetings, and
- [01:22] a lot more. To access, you'll need a
- [01:25] Google Workspace account. And once you
- [01:27] have it activated, you can either get it
- [01:29] from your own workspace, from your work,
- [01:32] or if you have an education plan. And
- [01:34] once you are within your Gmail, you can
- [01:37] then access flows directly from here
- [01:39] where you can discover different flows
- [01:41] like automating your Gmail or you can
- [01:44] use agents that have been already
- [01:46] created by you and you can track the
- [01:47] activity directly within your Gmail app.
- [01:50] But another way is obviously accessing
- [01:52] it through the workspace flows UI and
- [01:54] this is a front end for you to create
- [01:56] the custom agents so that you can manage
- [01:58] various sorts of tasks. For example, I
- [02:01] can automate the process of notifying me
- [02:03] about emails from key people. So if I
- [02:05] wanted so that whenever someone like
- [02:08] world of AI emails me, I can have it so
- [02:10] that if it contains a specific word AI
- [02:13] models, then it will summarize the
- [02:16] contents of that email talking about
- [02:18] that AI model and then it will notify me
- [02:20] in the chat. This is a more streamlined
- [02:22] and faster way to get responses
- [02:24] summarized. So, I just got the world of
- [02:26] AI email address sending me an email
- [02:29] about an AI model and within the Google
- [02:31] chat app, I've been able to get a
- [02:34] summary of that email content that was
- [02:36] sent from the world of AI email address
- [02:38] talking about the new AI model. This was
- [02:40] an automation that was fully configured
- [02:42] in less than 30 seconds. And this is how
- [02:45] flows can easily automate various sorts
- [02:47] of things for you based off the agents
- [02:49] that you can develop over here. If you
- [02:52] ever spent hours going back and forth on
- [02:54] a UI, this right here is going to save
- [02:57] you a lot of time. Normally, building a
- [03:00] mockup takes days, especially if you're
- [03:03] not a designer. You're stuck emailing
- [03:05] screenshots, waiting for feedback, and
- [03:07] tweaking endlessly. UX Pilot is an AI
- [03:11] powered tool that lets you turn ideas
- [03:14] into ready to use UI screens in minutes.
- [03:17] You don't need to be a designer. It
- [03:20] works with your existing design system
- [03:22] and you can export straight to Figma.
- [03:24] All you got to do is simply prompt in
- [03:26] natural language and it's going to fully
- [03:28] build out a beautiful UI for you. It
- [03:31] essentially cuts out weeks of back and
- [03:33] forth whether you're a founder, PM, or
- [03:36] engineer. You can get polished mockups
- [03:38] ready for your team or even investor
- [03:41] super fast. check it out yourself with
- [03:43] the link in the description below and
- [03:45] get 15% off your first plan with the
- [03:48] code in the description below. But with
- [03:50] that thought, let's dive right back into
- [03:51] today's video. But to get started, I'll
- [03:53] leave a link to the Flow's website in
- [03:55] the description below. This is
- [03:56] essentially where you can describe a
- [03:58] task to Gemini and it'll work on
- [04:00] creating that AI automation for you. And
- [04:03] this is where if you scroll down, you're
- [04:04] going to be able to access these
- [04:06] ready-made templates that you can work
- [04:07] with where you can automate better
- [04:09] meetings. You can connect with your
- [04:11] team, email boosters, and you can even
- [04:14] have it so that the agents can help you
- [04:16] with tasks like autocreating tasks when
- [04:18] I'm sent an action item. And it works
- [04:21] with all of these different tools. So,
- [04:22] if I click on this one, for example,
- [04:24] this is where it can help me uh decide
- [04:27] on something. It can help me extract
- [04:29] contents, create a task, and you can
- [04:31] even add a subtask. If I go back, you
- [04:34] can then have it so that you can manage
- [04:36] all of your agents and activity within
- [04:38] this tab over here. And also works with
- [04:40] other apps like the ability to work with
- [04:43] Salesforce or other integrations like
- [04:46] Mailchimp. Now, there's two ways to also
- [04:48] create agents by simply describing. But
- [04:50] if you click on a new agent, this is
- [04:53] where it will take you to the drag and
- [04:54] drop builder like you would see with
- [04:56] other noode AI automation platforms
- [04:59] where you can use this canvas to build
- [05:01] with different nodes. So if you want to
- [05:03] automate a task like whenever I get an
- [05:06] email or when someone joins a space or
- [05:09] based off of a meeting, you can paste in
- [05:11] that node into that starter node. From
- [05:14] here, you can provide the meeting
- [05:16] details, the time, and then you can move
- [05:19] on to the next step, which is an action
- [05:20] that will automate based off of the
- [05:22] starter node. But another way to use the
- [05:25] flows agent builder to create agents is
- [05:28] by simply typing in a natural language
- [05:29] prompt, like creating a lead enrichment
- [05:31] agent. I can simply go ahead and click
- [05:33] on create. This is essentially where
- [05:36] whenever a new lead is submitted within
- [05:38] any of the Google suite of tools like
- [05:41] Gmail or if it's a form, it is where
- [05:44] it's going to then follow up by pulling
- [05:46] the lead details as well as having
- [05:48] Gemini enrich the lead where it can
- [05:50] research on the company, determine if
- [05:53] it's worthy or not based off the
- [05:55] specifications I list and and it can
- [05:57] even score it based off of the
- [05:58] contextual and research capabilities of
- [06:01] the Gemini model. And then we can even
- [06:03] have it create an update to our sales
- [06:05] CRM sheet. In this case, it looks like
- [06:07] it has done it for Google notes. But
- [06:10] I've gone ahead and made this workflow a
- [06:12] lot better. It is where it starts off
- [06:15] with whenever I get an email, it will
- [06:17] either decide if it is going to see if
- [06:20] this is actually a lead that it can
- [06:23] process and if it is, it will then work
- [06:25] on extracting with this conditional
- [06:26] node. And this is where it will work on
- [06:29] extracting the contents like the company
- [06:31] name, the lead details, the contact
- [06:33] information, the contact person. From
- [06:36] there, it will send me an email as well
- [06:38] as a Google chat notification on the
- [06:41] lead that it was able to extract. This
- [06:44] is a fullon functional workflow. And now
- [06:47] we just got to add in who we're going to
- [06:49] send this email to after extracting the
- [06:51] lead. So the workflow is now working.
- [06:53] So, I sent in a demo email so that it
- [06:56] can extract these contents like my name,
- [06:58] my company, my email, as well as my
- [07:01] phone number. This is just made up
- [07:03] content. And now I'm going to go over
- [07:05] back into the automation to see if it
- [07:08] was able to send me a summary of this
- [07:10] lead collection. And there we go. It
- [07:12] looks like it was able to give us a
- [07:14] summary of our lead as well as
- [07:16] extracting and summarizing the contents
- [07:18] of that lead, what the actual client is
- [07:20] looking for, in this case, AI automation
- [07:22] solutions, the priority, as well as the
- [07:23] original email that has been linked.
- [07:25] This was all fully completed in less
- [07:27] than 30 seconds by simply just chatting
- [07:30] with the agent to create that agent
- [07:31] workflow. And something I was just
- [07:33] thinking, I removed the other two steps
- [07:35] and I can actually add in another step
- [07:37] where I can have it extract the contents
- [07:39] and then I can even have it added within
- [07:42] sheets. So this way you can add the
- [07:44] whole process of data collection a lot
- [07:46] easier. So whenever you have leads
- [07:48] coming into your email, you can easily
- [07:50] have that process automated, which is
- [07:52] something that I will be teaching in
- [07:54] other videos later on. I have something
- [07:56] cool coming up which I'll be introducing
- [07:58] really soon, showcasing about AI
- [08:01] automation. If you like this video and

- [08:22] today's video on Flows. This is a really
- [08:25] great automation platform that Google
- [08:27] has developed and it's something that
- [08:28] works quite well with the suite of tools
