- [00:00] We've all heard of Nan. It's an
- [00:02] open-source AI agent, an automation
- [00:05] platform that lets you build and deploy
- [00:07] agents locally to automate almost
- [00:09] anything from sending out emails to
- [00:12] creating digital employees that can act
- [00:14] as a PM, software engineer, and so many
- [00:16] other roles. The challenge with NE
- [00:19] though is that it can feel quite
- [00:20] intimidating for new users. There are a
- [00:23] lot of components to actually manage and
- [00:25] translating an idea into a workflow
- [00:27] often requires deep awareness with the
- [00:30] tool. That's where Deep Agent comes in.
- [00:32] Deep Agent is a general AI super agent
- [00:35] that can practically do it all. It's an
- [00:37] all-in-one AI agent, but now they
- [00:39] introduced a new N style visual workflow
- [00:42] builder that dynamically is easier to
- [00:45] use because it's powered by natural
- [00:47] language prompts and an agentic
- [00:49] reasoning layer using state-of-the-art
- [00:51] models. So instead of just manually
- [00:53] wiring every step with the visual
- [00:55] builder, Heap Agent is going to let you
- [00:57] generate, adapt, and optimize workflows
- [01:00] based on the goals, constraints, and
- [01:02] real [music] world inputs. The workflow
- [01:04] acts as the execution engine while the
- [01:06] AI model serves as the planner, the
- [01:09] decision maker, and bringing the AGI
- [01:11] narrative into real practical business
- [01:14] automation. You can obviously get
- [01:15] started with the low code workflow
- [01:17] builder where you can use it to drag and
- [01:20] drop different nodes to build out your
- [01:22] automation or you can use the natural
- [01:24] language workflow which I just mentioned
- [01:26] where you simply describe the outcome
- [01:27] you want and deep agent builds the
- [01:29] entire pipeline then reviews it
- [01:31] refineses it so that it is ready to use.
- [01:34] Just take a look at this example where
- [01:36] DP agent automatically creates a
- [01:38] multi-step workflow. And this is an
- [01:40] automation to automate data extraction
- [01:43] and also creating a report based off of
- [01:45] the various sorts of files that you
- [01:47] upload. You can see that it meticulously
- [01:49] creates a pretty intricate workflow that
- [01:52] has different sorts of functionalities
- [01:54] where it calculates the growth, the year
- [01:57] uh growth calculation, the profit margin
- [01:59] and so many other KPIs and it then
- [02:01] organizes the data into structured
- [02:03] financial outputs with various sorts of
- [02:06] metrics and you can see that it's able
- [02:08] to end up creating a clear auditable
- [02:10] pipeline as well as a report and this
- [02:13] overall automates the process of data
- [02:15] entry as well as data extraction. and
- [02:17] then creating an analysis on top of it.
- [02:20] Here is another workflow that was built
- [02:22] off of a natural language prompt that
- [02:24] was sent in. And the purpose of this
- [02:26] workflow is to extract various sorts of
- [02:28] leads and then have an AI agent work on
- [02:31] the outreach on tackling those new leads
- [02:34] that it had found. And you can see that
- [02:36] it's able to draft up different emails
- [02:38] and it's able to even send out those
- [02:40] emails for you. And what you can also do
- [02:42] is have a follow-up agent directly built
- [02:46] based off of the natural language prompt
- [02:47] that you send in to Abacus's AI's deep
- [02:50] agent, which will work on tackling each
- [02:52] and every component of your workflow. So
- [02:54] you can edit and configure each node
- [02:57] based off of the prompt that you send
- [02:58] in. And this way you can automate a
- [03:00] simple task like this. And you can even
- [03:02] have it so that you can automate this
- [03:04] task of reaching out to new brands to
- [03:07] maybe secure new clients. But thanks to
- [03:09] Abacus AI for sponsoring today's video.
- [03:12] And to get started, you can use the link
- [03:13] in the description below and you can
- [03:15] head over to this page where you can
- [03:17] simply get started if you do not have an
- [03:19] account. To get started, you need to pay
- [03:21] approximately $10 per user build
- [03:23] monthly. But that is going to get you
- [03:25] access to obviously the agent which not
- [03:27] only has the capability to use the AI
- [03:30] workflow feature, but you can create
- [03:32] chat bots, create powerpoints, automate
- [03:34] browser based tasks, and so much more.
- [03:36] And not just that, you get access to
- [03:38] various sorts of abacus AI suite of
- [03:40] tools like chat LM where you can chat
- [03:42] with state-of-the-art models like Claude
- [03:44] 4.5 Sonnet or something like Gemini
- [03:47] directly in one unified chatbot. You can
- [03:50] also use their state-of-the-art abacus
- [03:52] AI desktop agent which is a coding agent
- [03:54] and editor built within and you can get
- [03:57] a lot out of that. I've already made
- [03:59] multiple videos on it so you can take a
- [04:00] look at it from my channel. But now
- [04:02] let's go ahead and click on get started.
- [04:04] Before we get started, I just want to
- [04:06] mention that you should definitely go
- [04:07] ahead and subscribe to the world of AI
- [04:09] newsletter. I'm constantly posting
- [04:11] different newsletters on a weekly basis.
- [04:14] So, this is where you can easily get
- [04:16] up-to-date knowledge about what is
- [04:18] happening in the AI space. So,
- [04:20] definitely go ahead and subscribe as
- [04:21] this is completely for free. Then once
- [04:24] you have created an account or logged
- [04:26] in, you can then head over to deep agent
- [04:28] and this is where you can start working
- [04:30] with the new AI workflow feature. This
- [04:33] is where you can either upload files or
- [04:35] you can use a fast mode to generate your
- [04:37] workflow. But since I want to have it
- [04:39] meticulously create my workflow, I'm
- [04:41] going to add it a descriptive prompt as
- [04:44] to what I wanted to create. This is
- [04:46] where I am creating an agentic lead
- [04:48] extraction workflow that accepts
- [04:50] different sorts of inputs like the demo
- [04:52] one. But in this case I wanted to have
- [04:54] it so that it then creates a full
- [04:57] detailed report a summary report which
- [04:59] is ensuring all the data is traceable to
- [05:02] sources and logging it for step-by-step
- [05:05] audibility. So it is going to then work
- [05:08] on refining it before it works on
- [05:10] creating it. So you can specify the
- [05:13] clarification that it's requesting. And
- [05:15] after providing the additional
- [05:16] information, you can see that it is
- [05:18] going to then execute the code to then
- [05:21] develop this workflow. And you can see
- [05:23] that it does a great job and it details
- [05:26] out each and every step. And you'll see
- [05:29] this when it finishes coding out this
- [05:31] workflow. You can then access it and
- [05:34] you're going to be able to visualize the
- [05:35] workflow to see what it actually built.
- [05:38] And once it finishes generating the
- [05:40] workflow, you can then access it
- [05:41] directly by testing and editing the
- [05:44] actual visual workflow. And this is
- [05:46] where it'll display the nodes condensed
- [05:49] down for the lead extraction and scoring
- [05:51] pipeline. You can then also test it out
- [05:54] directly where you can click on test
- [05:56] workflow and you can see what you can
- [05:58] actually extract with this workflow. So
- [06:00] you have the option of either providing
- [06:02] a URL, plain text, email content, or
- [06:06] priority roles that you want to have it
- [06:08] extract. In this case, I am going to
- [06:10] attach a demo leads uh file. And
- [06:13] essentially, we're going to have it
- [06:14] extract the contents that we're looking
- [06:16] for. You can simply go ahead and click
- [06:18] submit. And now the AI is going to work
- [06:21] towards these multiple steps to extract
- [06:23] everything for us. And once it finishes
- [06:26] extracting the contents, you'll see that
- [06:28] it is going to then create a complete
- [06:30] leads list. Now, in this demo, I didn't
- [06:33] provide all of the details because
- [06:35] YouTube doesn't like it when I showcase
- [06:37] emails or phone numbers. But in this
- [06:39] case, it was able to extract the website
- [06:41] contents, the company name, as well as
- [06:44] the URL. And then if it is related to
- [06:47] whatever we're looking to extract, like
- [06:50] the high intent leads, then it will
- [06:52] display it over here based off of the
- [06:54] scoring. And then it can even generate
- [06:56] an audit. Uh it will also generate an
- [06:59] executive summary report which we can
- [07:01] actually take a look at. This is where
- [07:03] it will describe how many types of A
- [07:07] tier, Btier, Ctier leads it had found.
- [07:10] And you can see that this is uh giving
- [07:13] us a low priority because it does not
- [07:15] fit our scoring here that we had
- [07:17] created. And it provides us the
- [07:19] executive summary of the performance of
- [07:21] the leads that it caught. Here is
- [07:24] another demo where I simply just
- [07:25] requested it to create a an Aentic
- [07:28] invoice data extraction workflow. And
- [07:30] this is where it extracts different
- [07:32] sorts of contents from various sorts of
- [07:34] file types. And then it creates a
- [07:36] summary off of that as well. But here
- [07:39] within the workflow builder, you have
- [07:41] the ability to craft up your own
- [07:43] workflow. So rather than relying on the
- [07:45] AI to build out all your components, you
- [07:47] can add in different sorts of nodes. And
- [07:49] these are basic function nodes that make
- [07:52] your automation truly what it is. So you
- [07:55] can add in a tool or you can add in a
- [07:57] decision which is where you can add a
- [08:00] condition which is only executing when a
- [08:02] certain condition is met or based off of
- [08:06] whenever you get an email or something
- [08:08] like looping the node so that it works
- [08:10] in a continuous loop. There's so many
- [08:12] different types of nodes within these
- [08:14] four primary templates. But you also
- [08:17] have the ability to create a custom node
- [08:19] where you can describe the AI that you
- [08:22] want to configure the node with and it
- [08:24] is then going to create a node for that.
- [08:26] So in this case I had created a Python
- [08:29] execution node and you can then connect
- [08:31] it to either an input or so that you can
- [08:35] have it so that it outputs something and
- [08:38] then delivers it to whoever is accessing
- [08:40] it. But just take a look at it live in
- [08:42] action. This is where you can upload
- [08:44] your PDF of an invoice and then it's
- [08:46] going to work on extracting the key uh
- [08:49] components that we're looking for like
- [08:51] the tax, total amount, currency, and
- [08:53] then it will validate tools against line
- [08:55] items. It'll flag inconsistencies and
- [08:58] then it's going to structure all of the
- [09:00] results into an output. That is where it
- [09:03] will also combine a combined invoice
- [09:05] table and a summary report. So you can
- [09:08] upload multiple invoices in this case
- [09:10] and it is going to extract the key
- [09:12] components that we're looking for. And
- [09:14] you can see that it was able to extract
- [09:15] the contents based off of that single
- [09:17] invoice that was provided. It passed the
- [09:19] validation as well. And it was able to
- [09:22] extract all of the components from this
- [09:24] sample PDF. And you can see that it was
- [09:26] able to get everything correctly which
- [09:28] is great to see. And it is also going to
- [09:31] generate the JSON export so that you can
- [09:33] use it for whatever purpose you're
- [09:35] looking to use it for. automations truly
- [09:37] got a lot more easier with this new
- [09:40] workflow feature. And I highly recommend
- [09:42] that you start using this with the links
- [09:43] in the description below because not
- [09:45] only do you get access to the workflow
- [09:47] builder, which you can easily create
- [09:49] with a simple prompt, but you get access
- [09:51] to so many other cool things like the
- [09:53] ability to create chat bots, different
- [09:56] sorts of powerpoints, videos, and so
- [09:58] much more. I'll leave all these links in
- [10:00] the description below. But with that
- [10:01] thought, guys, thank you guys so much
- [10:02] for watching. Make sure you go ahead and
- [10:04] subscribe to the second channel, join
- [10:05] the newsletter, join our Discord, follow
- [10:07] me on Twitter, and lastly, make sure you
- [10:09] guys subscribe, turn on notification
- [10:10] bell, like this video, and please take a
- [10:12] look at our previous videos because
- [10:13] there is a lot of content that you will
- [10:15] truly benefit from. But with that
- [10:16] thought, guys, have an amazing day,
- [10:18] spread positivity, and I'll see you guys
- [10:20] fairly shortly. He suffers.
