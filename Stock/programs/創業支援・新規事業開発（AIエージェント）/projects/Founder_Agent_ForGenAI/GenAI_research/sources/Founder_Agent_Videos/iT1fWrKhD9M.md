- [00:00] So, OpenAI just launched ChadBt Atlas.
- [00:03] This is OpenAI's own browser. So, here
- [00:06] Atlas integrates Chad GBT directly into
- [00:09] the browsing experience. This is similar
- [00:11] to Perplexity's Comet. So, if you've
- [00:13] tried that, this is not going to be too
- [00:15] new. So, today, let me show you what
- [00:17] they've announced. I've tested this
- [00:19] thing kind of extensively. Specifically,
- [00:21] I'm very excited about the agent mode. I
- [00:23] think we're at a point where these
- [00:24] things are becoming legitimately useful.
- [00:27] So to start we can type in a question or
- [00:29] a URL. We can say what's on Reddit today
- [00:32] and it gives you kind of a summary of
- [00:34] what's happening. You can also go to
- [00:35] sources or you can actually navigate you
- [00:38] to specific pages. And once you're on a
- [00:40] particular web page, you can also click
- [00:42] this askt button and just chat with
- [00:45] chatbt about what's happening on this
- [00:47] page. So let's say click summarize. It
- [00:49] will go ahead and summarize the key
- [00:51] themes and points from this. So it will
- [00:53] search for you. It will summarize pages
- [00:55] and with agent mode, it will actually
- [00:57] take some pretty advanced actions that
- [01:00] interact with the websites. Now, I
- [01:02] noticed that it knows my custom
- [01:04] instructions that I have for my ChadBt.
- [01:06] So, this is your version of ChadBt. This
- [01:09] is the same chatbot that that you're
- [01:10] used to, but now in this sort of split
- [01:12] screen view where you have the browsing
- [01:14] and the AI assistant on the right. And
- [01:16] over time, as it gets more memories,
- [01:18] better memories, it should get better
- [01:20] and better at finding the things you
- [01:21] like, navigating the web in the way that
- [01:24] you prefer, kind of like which things
- [01:25] you're logged into, which things you
- [01:27] use. Now, this is a kind of a Chrome
- [01:29] plugin. It's live globally, but only on
- [01:32] Mac OS. If you're not on Mac OS, you
- [01:35] know, it's coming soon, but if you're on
- [01:36] a Mac OS, it's available to everyone.
- [01:38] The thing that really caught my eye was
- [01:40] the agent mode. So, you can click agent
- [01:42] mode, and you can select it from here as
- [01:45] well. and agent mode. You kind of see
- [01:47] preview here. They got a little like
- [01:48] this grid-like animation and the cursor
- [01:50] moving. And I gotta say, it's getting
- [01:52] pretty good. So, in this video, I really
- [01:54] wanted to dive into agent mode because
- [01:57] once the abilities of these large
- [01:59] language models pass a certain threshold
- [02:00] in terms of how they're able to navigate
- [02:02] the web and use Excel spreadsheets and
- [02:05] various other computer apps and
- [02:06] software, at some point that really
- [02:08] begins changing how we interact with our
- [02:10] computers, potentially even making
- [02:12] people more efficient at their jobs.
- [02:14] maybe even automating some jobs. So, I'm
- [02:16] not saying we're there yet, but I got to
- [02:18] say this is getting pretty good. Let's
- [02:20] uh dive in and take a look. All right,
- [02:22] let's try out Atlas's agent mode. So, I
- [02:25] asked Atlas to interact with Google
- [02:27] spreadsheets. I had to go online, find
- [02:29] some data, and now asked it to put it
- [02:31] into this spreadsheet that I have open.
- [02:33] This is what popped up. It said agent
- [02:35] mode may introduce risk. And you have
- [02:37] two options here. You can be logged in
- [02:39] to the site that you're interacting with
- [02:40] or start logged out. So, this is just to
- [02:43] protect you in case there's some sort of
- [02:45] an injection. So, we're going to go
- [02:46] ahead and click start logged in. And as
- [02:48] you can see here, so it's thinking about
- [02:50] what it's supposed to do. And it's
- [02:52] thinking about it now. It just went
- [02:54] ahead and pasted it all into A6. So,
- [02:58] let's see uh where it goes from here. By
- [03:00] the way, I may have accidentally made
- [03:01] this task a little bit more difficult
- [03:03] for it because I think I just
- [03:05] accidentally put some random keystrokes
- [03:07] into I6 or whatever. So, now it's trying
- [03:10] to reverse that. It's like, oh, we don't
- [03:11] want that data in there. Let me delete
- [03:13] it. So, good start, I guess. Oh, there
- [03:16] it goes. And it's just um going through
- [03:18] line by line. So, basically, what it has
- [03:20] to do is go take a look at my channel on
- [03:24] YouTube, see what the last 10 videos
- [03:26] were, and just get some data like dates,
- [03:29] titles, and how many views it has, and
- [03:31] then put all that data into this
- [03:34] spreadsheet. So, let's try again. There
- [03:35] we go. Date published, title, views. So,
- [03:38] notice the little cursor it's using. So,
- [03:40] it's actually interacting this, as far
- [03:42] as I can tell, live like you and I
- [03:44] would. So, it's moving the cursor. It's
- [03:45] typing things in. Okay. And now it's
- [03:48] putting in the actual data. So, that
- [03:51] took a little bit. That took a minute or
- [03:53] two for it to figure out how to do it.
- [03:55] So, it did a few different approaches
- [03:56] and finally decided to just click on
- [03:59] each cell separately and then input the
- [04:02] data into that cell. And as it's doing
- [04:04] that, interestingly, it's very humanlike
- [04:07] how it's approaching this. All right.
- [04:09] So, it worked for 6 minutes. It had a
- [04:10] few back and forths, but finally I feel
- [04:13] like it did what it was supposed to.
- [04:15] Now, there's some issues. So, it didn't
- [04:17] take my last 10 videos. I think it just
- [04:20] searched my name and then pulled up
- [04:22] whatever the first however many videos
- [04:24] were shown. And it did struggle with
- [04:25] data input for a little bit. Looks like
- [04:27] there's also one piece of information
- [04:29] missing views for this particular video.
- [04:31] But overall, interestingly, it sort of
- [04:34] completed the task. Not perfectly, but
- [04:37] I'm not going to say I'm impressed, but
- [04:38] my curiosity is peaked. All right, so
- [04:41] here we are in Google Docs this time.
- [04:44] So, I opened up a brand new Google Docs
- [04:46] and I'm going to click on ask ChatGpt
- [04:48] here in the corner so that that chat
- [04:49] with GPT window pops up that allows you
- [04:51] to control everything. And as you can
- [04:53] see here, it gives you some ideas and it
- [04:56] also suggests agent mode. So, let's see
- [04:58] what that's going to be able to do.
- [04:59] We'll click agent mode. Notice we're
- [05:01] saying agent mode. We're logged in. And
- [05:03] so we're logged into Google Sheets or
- [05:05] Google Docs. And we also have some other
- [05:07] options. We're using web search. We can
- [05:09] use a cloud browser if we wanted to. We
- [05:11] can also have GitHub connected as well
- [05:14] as Box, Dropbox, Gmail, and there's a
- [05:16] lot more. All right, let's see. We're
- [05:18] going to ask it to go to Reddit
- [05:20] Singularity, find the top trending AI
- [05:23] news, let's say in the last few days,
- [05:25] and post them in this document with a
- [05:28] brief summary and links to that Reddit
- [05:30] post. also includes some data on how
- [05:31] many views or upvotes each received. And
- [05:34] away it goes. So, it goes into its
- [05:36] little agent mode. Very exciting. I
- [05:39] apologize if the window looks a little
- [05:40] bit weird. So, Atlas went globally live,
- [05:43] but only for MacOSS. Will Smith eating
- [05:46] spaghetti on the front page of Reddit,
- [05:48] but anyway. So, I record on a Windows,
- [05:50] but I do have my MacBook. So, I am sort
- [05:53] of streaming my MacBook and recording it
- [05:56] on my Windows. So, I apologize if it
- [05:58] looks a little bit weird. And one other
- [05:59] thing I'm going to test simultaneously
- [06:01] is well, can it do multiple tasks
- [06:04] simultaneously? So, I opened up another
- [06:06] tab. I clicked agent mode. And you know
- [06:08] what? I I'll just go ahead and give it a
- [06:09] few different tasks that we'll kind of
- [06:11] unpack one at a time as it goes along.
- [06:13] In a different window, I gave it one of
- [06:15] the tasks that I usually give every
- [06:17] single thing of this nature, and that is
- [06:19] find an online mind sweeper game and
- [06:22] win, which sometimes has some pretty
- [06:24] hilarious outcomes. And I gotta say I'm
- [06:26] very impressed with what it's doing
- [06:28] because again this is not the first
- [06:30] iterations of OpenAI's sort of computer
- [06:33] use. They had operator and now this is
- [06:36] agent mode within the Atlas browser. So
- [06:39] it's it's not probably brand new. It's
- [06:41] probably built on top of the existing
- [06:42] technology. But I think it will be
- [06:44] interesting to see how having their own
- [06:46] browser how having Chad kind of built in
- [06:49] there how that's going to affect its
- [06:51] ability to navigate the web to reason
- [06:53] about what it's doing. Meanwhile, low
- [06:55] and behold, our Reddit task is done.
- [06:58] That took about five minutes. It did
- [07:00] came up with a title for the sheet. Top
- [07:01] AI news from our singularity October
- [07:04] 2025. Perfect. Keep in mind this is
- [07:06] running or was running simultaneously to
- [07:08] this where the agent is playing Mind
- [07:11] Sweeper. So, you can have as many tabs
- [07:13] as you want open. You can have multiple
- [07:14] agents running in there. There's
- [07:16] probably some limit. We'll see if we can
- [07:18] uh find that limit where the end is, but
- [07:20] Ch is doing pretty well with this Mind
- [07:22] Sweeper game. But notice it did exactly
- [07:24] what we said here. So Will Smith eating
- [07:26] spaghetti. So that's talking about
- [07:27] Google VO3.1 that was recently launched.
- [07:30] It has a summary and interestingly gives
- [07:33] some good background. So this playful
- [07:35] meme has been around since 2023 and
- [07:37] gives a pretty good sort of background.
- [07:39] So if you're not familiar why Will Smith
- [07:41] is eating spaghetti kind of like in one
- [07:43] or two sentences just tells you, you
- [07:44] know, back in 2023 this sort of video
- [07:46] looked grotesque. And the fact now it
- [07:48] looks pretty good kind of sparked a
- [07:50] discussion about how quickly AI
- [07:51] generated video is progressing.
- [07:53] Interestingly, so notice it says why it
- [07:56] matters. So actually I just remember
- [07:58] this. I do have custom instructions for
- [08:00] CHBT. And one of the things that I add
- [08:02] into custom instructions for readability
- [08:04] is I say why does this matter? So when
- [08:07] you're doing deep research, tell me why
- [08:08] it matters. Any insights? Because
- [08:10] sometimes it'll just say the headline
- [08:12] like this test got a 76% improvement.
- [08:15] And if you ask it to tell you any
- [08:16] additional insights why it matters, it
- [08:18] often gives a much sort of in-depth
- [08:20] answer. Oftentimes helping you
- [08:22] understand why that's a big headline or
- [08:25] you know why it matters. So in this case
- [08:27] it very succinctly says look using a
- [08:29] familiar meme as a benchmark helps
- [08:31] people intuitively grasp the
- [08:33] improvements. Then it has engagement. So
- [08:35] we asked for engagement kind of like how
- [08:37] many people are enjoying this, upvoting,
- [08:39] viewing this and of course the red link.
- [08:41] This is perfect. All right. Next, we're
- [08:43] going to say let's let's take a look at
- [08:44] one of those stories. That's the new
- [08:46] apps SDK that OpenAI launched in ChadBt.
- [08:50] So, I'm going to say let's look at the
- [08:51] story and just copy and pasted the title
- [08:53] of like what it titled it, which is just
- [08:55] chipt and apps SDK. And we're going to
- [08:57] say let's try to figure out how big of a
- [09:00] story this is. And specifically, we're
- [09:02] going to compare it to the leaked story
- [09:04] that Amazon is planning to lay off
- [09:06] something like 600,000 workers in the US
- [09:09] and replace them with robots. So, I told
- [09:10] it to compare it to that and just pasted
- [09:12] in the title of that story. And we're
- [09:14] going to say find whatever metrics
- [09:16] online that show how big the stories are
- [09:18] relative to each other. We're going to
- [09:19] say, use Reddit and up votes as well as
- [09:22] Google Trends as well as any other
- [09:23] credible sources to determine how much
- [09:25] interest there is in these stories.
- [09:27] Write out your findings at the bottom of
- [09:29] this Google doc. And we're going to
- [09:31] click go. So, you're getting what I'm
- [09:33] trying to do. I'm trying to have it do
- [09:34] some analysis for me for how big these
- [09:36] two sto are compared to each other.
- [09:38] Right? So, one has a 10,000 Reddit up
- [09:40] votes, the other has 500, right? So, the
- [09:43] 10,000 is bigger. Google Trends shows us
- [09:45] search data, search trends. And I'm also
- [09:48] extremely curious to see where else it
- [09:50] goes to kind of check when left to its
- [09:52] own devices. What is it going to use to
- [09:54] try to figure out what's a bigger story?
- [09:56] What's a trending story? Meanwhile, our
- [09:58] mind sweeper agent won the game. Did it
- [10:02] do so playing by the rules and being a
- [10:04] good sportsman? No. No, it did not. It
- [10:07] found some way to cheat. I don't even
- [10:08] know what it did. I assume maybe it
- [10:10] found some custom board size and just
- [10:12] set it to be one by one. Then it went
- [10:15] ahead and just clicked the one square,
- [10:17] thereby winning the game. 100%
- [10:19] efficiency. Oh boy. Well, I guess I
- [10:21] can't blame it. It did win. It did
- [10:23] complete the task as I requested it to.
- [10:25] All right, let's launch another agent.
- [10:27] Let's see if this one can unsubscribe me
- [10:29] from all the spammy marketing emails
- [10:32] that I receive. I'm going to say go into
- [10:33] my Gmail and unsubscribe me from all my
- [10:35] emails in the promotions tab that have
- [10:38] unsubscribe links. So far, I've had a
- [10:40] few agents like this that could do it,
- [10:43] but the maximum they're willing to do is
- [10:44] like maybe three or four emails and they
- [10:46] stop. If this can unsubscribe you from
- [10:49] even 10 per run, I mean, I think that
- [10:52] would be pretty cool. If it's willing to
- [10:54] do all of them, that would be amazing.
- [10:56] Okay, I can't show some of these emails,
- [10:58] but basically it just says, "Per safety
- [11:00] guidelines, I want to make sure you
- [11:01] confirm before I proceeded to go and
- [11:03] unsubscribe you." And we're going to
- [11:05] say, "Yeah, unsubscribe me from
- [11:07] everything." So, this is interesting. It
- [11:09] encountered a set of instructions on the
- [11:10] Gmail page. Now, this could be a prompt
- [11:13] injection. So, it's being very careful.
- [11:14] It's like, "Do you want me to not follow
- [11:16] any instructions from the screen without
- [11:18] your explicit direction?" So, I said,
- [11:20] "Yes, unsubscribe me. Don't follow
- [11:22] on-screen instructions not related to
- [11:24] that task." So, it's going to be
- [11:26] interesting to see how well it's able to
- [11:27] handle this. All right, the first one is
- [11:29] going very well. So, this is from Vimeo.
- [11:31] So, it clicked unsubscribe and now
- [11:33] hopefully it's going to click the big
- [11:35] blue unsubscribe button. And it did.
- [11:39] Hooray. Okay. So, one email
- [11:41] unsubscribed. That's a uh success. Now,
- [11:44] it's unsubscribing me from yet another
- [11:46] marketing email. So, that's two. All
- [11:49] right. So, it's doing great.
- [11:50] Unfortunately, it's stopping to confirm
- [11:53] quite a bit, making it a little bit not
- [11:55] efficient for me. But I got to say, I
- [11:57] mean, it's it's finishing it. It's doing
- [11:58] it perfectly correct. Going back to our
- [12:01] Reddit research agent. So, we're
- [12:03] comparing it to stories, how popular
- [12:05] they are, how trending they are. So, it
- [12:07] worked for 4 minutes on those stories.
- [12:09] And here are the results. So, notice it
- [12:12] starts by saying, okay, so on the R
- [12:14] Singularity subreddit, the story, one of
- [12:17] them gathered this many up votes. that
- [12:19] was from the previous instructions from
- [12:21] the previous story that it found. And in
- [12:23] the same subreddit, the other story
- [12:25] earned this many uploads. So I got to
- [12:28] give it huge credit for that. So it's
- [12:30] drawing on the context. It's comparing
- [12:32] apples to apples, right? So it's not
- [12:34] going to a bigger subreddit or a smaller
- [12:36] subreddit. It's like, okay, we have this
- [12:38] data here. Let's find the correlating
- [12:40] data point on that same subreddit for
- [12:43] this story number two. It also checks
- [12:45] some other subreddit and lists what it
- [12:48] finds, how many up votes on two
- [12:49] different stories, and also has links in
- [12:52] case you want to go and check it out for
- [12:53] yourself. Google trends for the past 7
- [12:55] days show that ChadBt apps far outnumber
- [12:58] those for Amazon replace worker robots.
- [13:01] So, I'm going to give it a solid B for
- [13:02] that. You probably need some sort of
- [13:04] custom instructions to explain to it how
- [13:06] to make sure that you're doing Google
- [13:08] Trends correctly. This is a skill issue,
- [13:10] but it's easily fixed. But the fact that
- [13:12] I went on Google Trends and visually
- [13:14] inspected the graphs and charts, I I
- [13:17] mean that's amazing. Very very useful
- [13:19] for doing online research. Then we have
- [13:21] a media coverage. And there the Amazon
- [13:24] piece is one of the most popular ones
- [13:26] and it notices that it's that's in
- [13:28] contrast to what we found through Google
- [13:30] Trends and Reddit. This is extremely
- [13:33] good. This is very impressive. So, in
- [13:36] this one, I asked the agent mode of
- [13:38] Atlas to go online, find a motivational
- [13:42] story about somebody getting into the
- [13:43] best shape of their lives. It has to be
- [13:45] somewhere where they posted their entire
- [13:47] meal plan and food log, right? So, that
- [13:49] was sort of step one. Find what they
- [13:52] were eating to get to that point. Then
- [13:54] recreate that meal plan for me. Then go
- [13:57] on Instacart and order everything that I
- [14:00] would need to make that meal plan. So,
- [14:03] so far it's added five things.
- [14:05] cucumbers. I think it was searching for
- [14:07] whey protein at some point. Looks like
- [14:09] it's getting some broccoli and zucchini
- [14:12] and garlic for me. So, it's navigating
- [14:14] this thing very very effectively. At the
- [14:17] very beginning when it just went into
- [14:18] Instacart, Instacart pops up saying,
- [14:20] "Hey, do you want a free trial of
- [14:22] something?" So, I was a little bit
- [14:24] worried that Chad is going to be like,
- [14:25] "Yeah, that sounds like a great idea."
- [14:27] But no, you know what? It said it said
- [14:29] no thank you. Clicked the no thank you
- [14:31] button. So, definitely gets a thumbs up
- [14:33] for that. And there it is. So that's my
- [14:36] order. So as you can see here, there's a
- [14:37] bunch of things. Everything looks pretty
- [14:39] good. Baby spring mix, natural cage
- [14:42] free, large brown eggs. I mean, this
- [14:44] this seems legit. All right. So at this
- [14:46] point, it worked for 5 minutes. All the
- [14:48] items I got, I believe that this was
- [14:50] part of a healthy meal plan. So the
- [14:52] 5minute part was just the Instacart and
- [14:55] checking out. Before that, it worked for
- [14:57] 4 minutes. Finding that transformation.
- [14:59] Looks like it found somebody in Men's
- [15:01] Health and got their meal plan, a
- [15:03] proposed 7-day meal plan. So, that's
- [15:06] perfect. Then, it stopped because it
- [15:08] needed me to log into Instacart. Again,
- [15:10] if you're logged in, it should be able
- [15:12] to just keep going. So, the first part
- [15:14] was 4 minutes, last part was 5 minutes.
- [15:16] So, a total of 9 minutes to go research
- [15:19] a meal plan and order it on Instacart.
- [15:22] As far as I can tell, this was done
- [15:23] flawlessly. All right, here I'm seeing
- [15:25] if it's able to use Hey Genen. So, hey
- [15:28] Jen is an AI avatar that you're able to
- [15:31] use and say whatever you want. Very
- [15:33] popular service. So, I told it to go
- [15:34] there, find a female avatar and have it
- [15:37] talk about Chad GPT Atlas. So, it worked
- [15:40] for a while. It stopped because it
- [15:41] needed me to log in. And here it is
- [15:44] interacting with the website to try to
- [15:46] create that avatar video. It's going to
- [15:48] be choosing a voice. Actually, that's
- [15:50] interesting. I'm pretty sure it can't
- [15:52] listen to the audio output. So, it it
- [15:55] has to just kind of assume it's working.
- [15:57] But, it created a script. It pasted it
- [15:59] in there. Everything should be working
- [16:01] perfectly. So, it wasn't able to
- [16:03] completed because the the button is
- [16:06] grayed out because you're supposed to
- [16:07] select a voice first. So, let's see if
- [16:10] it's able to do it. Yeah, it looks like
- [16:12] it's doing it fine. Okay. I can hear the
- [16:14] sound in the background. So, I can't
- [16:17] tell if it's able to if it if it is able
- [16:19] to hear the audio output or have some
- [16:21] sort of confirmation that the audio
- [16:23] played, but it's continuing still for
- [16:26] some reason has a trouble selecting the
- [16:27] voice. I guess it's clicking on play. It
- [16:29] needs to click anywhere else besides
- [16:31] play. There it is. Okay, so it selected
- [16:33] Annie professional. And now it should be
- [16:35] able to click generate video. Wow, it
- [16:38] did it. All right, so let's see what it
- [16:40] came up with. Let's hit play. Let's see
- [16:42] how well the sound comes through. Hello,
- [16:44] I'm excited to tell you about ChatGpt
- [16:46] Atlas, OpenAI's new AI powered web
- [16:48] browser. It integrates the Chat GPT
- [16:51] chatbot directly into your browser
- [16:53] window. You can ask for instant
- [16:54] summaries of articles, compare products,
- [16:57] or extract key insights from web pages
- [16:59] right in a sidebar without switching
- [17:01] tabs. One advanced feature is called
- [17:03] agent mode.
- [17:04] >> So, that's pretty cool. It would now
- [17:06] give you that whole website, create a
- [17:07] script, create an avatar. You know, I
- [17:09] just said female avatar, which it did.
- [17:12] It selected the right voice. A+. This is
- [17:15] terrific. It had some trouble selecting
- [17:17] the voice, but it it figured it out
- [17:18] eventually. Next, you might have heard
- [17:20] about a Deep Seek OCR paper. Basically,
- [17:23] they're finding that we're able to take
- [17:25] words, take a picture of those words, so
- [17:27] to speak, and basically have a limbs
- [17:29] read that. And the data compression is
- [17:32] pretty impressive. So instead of trying
- [17:33] to shove everything into the context
- [17:36] window, we're able to use images to be
- [17:39] able to just pack in a lot more data, a
- [17:41] lot more words into images. So I asked
- [17:43] Atlas, find out everything about the new
- [17:46] Deepseek OCR paper, then find any
- [17:48] well-known people in the AI space that
- [17:50] have talked about it. Create a Google
- [17:52] doc and write out a summary of the
- [17:53] paper, what people said about it with
- [17:55] links. So there's mainly two things that
- [17:58] I was looking here. one, did it sort of
- [18:00] figure out what it was about, summarize
- [18:02] it in a way that made it easy to
- [18:04] understand what it was, and two, Andre
- [18:07] Carpathy went into quite some detail
- [18:09] about this paper on Twitter. So, I just
- [18:12] wanted to see if we would be able to
- [18:13] find that cuz when we're saying
- [18:15] well-known people in the AI space that
- [18:17] talked about it, that better be one of
- [18:19] the names. That's probably one of the
- [18:21] most highest sort of ranked AI people
- [18:24] that have talked about that paper. And
- [18:26] of course, it's supposed to put it a
- [18:27] Google doc, which it did. So, it's
- [18:28] saying this is an open source vision
- [18:30] language model that reimagines how long
- [18:32] text context can be compressed and
- [18:34] processed by LMS. So, first and
- [18:36] foremost, everything is terrific. It's a
- [18:39] very good breakdown of why it's
- [18:41] important. They have a significant
- [18:43] section. They specifically point out
- [18:44] that this is a finding that could enable
- [18:46] LMS to handle context of millions of
- [18:48] tokens. And then we have reactions from
- [18:51] the community. Notice Andre Carpathy,
- [18:53] he's right there. So, interestingly, it
- [18:55] linked venture beat instead of X or
- [18:58] Twitter where Andre actually posted it.
- [19:00] So, so if I had to nitpick, this is I
- [19:03] would this is where I would do it. I'd
- [19:05] prefer if it was a link to Karpathy's
- [19:07] post, but I'm sure X doesn't just allow
- [19:10] any chatbot, especially Chad GBT, to
- [19:13] just crawl their website all
- [19:15] willy-nilly. I'm sure there's some some
- [19:16] limits to that. So, since VentureB sort
- [19:19] of like created their article about it,
- [19:20] it went to VentureB. This to me is an
- [19:23] A+. I mean, it absolutely knocked it out
- [19:25] of the park. Did exactly what it was
- [19:27] supposed to. Guess maybe not an A+. I'll
- [19:30] give it a solid A, maybe an A minus, but
- [19:32] again, I don't think it easily crawl
- [19:34] X.com, which is why it can't provide the
- [19:37] original post. We'll actually test out
- [19:39] to see how well it interacts with X in a
- [19:40] second. But again, very, very solid,
- [19:42] taking into account the fact that it
- [19:44] can't easily, most likely can't easily
- [19:46] browse X. All right. Next, I want to see
- [19:47] if it create a little audiobook for us.
- [19:49] So, I said, "Log into 11 Labs and use a
- [19:51] nice AI voice to create a short audio
- [19:53] book about how amazing honey badgers
- [19:55] are." All right. So, again, I had to
- [19:57] help it log in. In the future, once I'm
- [19:59] logged in, it has memory about stuff.
- [20:01] This shouldn't be an issue. This should
- [20:02] be a seamless process. But, it wrote out
- [20:04] this script. It had Sarah voice it. So,
- [20:07] let's listen to what it sounds like.
- [20:09] >> Overall, the honey badger is a reminder
- [20:11] that size doesn't determine strength.
- [20:13] Its resilience, intelligence, and
- [20:15] boldness make it one of the most amazing
- [20:17] animals in the natural world. like a
- [20:19] tiny superhero in the wild.
- [20:21] >> Also, Honey Badger don't care. Come on.
- [20:23] This is terrific. Again, A+.
- [20:26] Everything's perfect. Again, we can we
- [20:28] can tell it to do more things or we can
- [20:29] add various custom instructions if we do
- [20:31] this repeatedly. Maybe, hey, make sure
- [20:33] you use this specific voice for
- [20:35] everything, etc. But for a one-shot sort
- [20:39] of like my first time doing this, again,
- [20:41] it's oneshotting everything. So far,
- [20:43] extremely impressive. And last, but
- [20:45] certainly not least, I said, "Hey, I'm
- [20:47] doing a video about opening eyes at Chad
- [20:49] PT Atlas, do full research on it, what
- [20:51] are the features, create a new Google
- [20:53] doc, put all the details in there, and
- [20:54] then write out a 30 to 60 second intro
- [20:56] to the video about it, made it make it
- [20:58] exciting and engaging." So, here's that.
- [21:01] So, I went through to make sure that I
- [21:02] got the details correctly. So, for
- [21:05] example, it's going global. You know,
- [21:07] it's being released globally to
- [21:09] everybody, but only on Mac OS. I said
- [21:12] before, but Windows users are secondass
- [21:14] citizens. We are always forgotten about
- [21:17] our features delayed. It's extremely
- [21:19] frustrating. And it also got this right.
- [21:22] So agent mode is kind of an early
- [21:24] preview. It's available for plus pro and
- [21:27] business subscribers. Again, this
- [21:29] significance tab, this is most likely,
- [21:31] I'm pretty sure this is because I have
- [21:33] those special custom instructions where
- [21:34] it's supposed to draw some insights or
- [21:36] why it's important or significance,
- [21:38] whatever you want to call it. So that's
- [21:39] why it includes something like that
- [21:40] everywhere. So here it says the browser
- [21:43] also highlights the growing competition
- [21:45] in AI powered browsing joint offerings
- [21:47] from Perplexity Opera and the upcoming
- [21:50] AI enhanced Chrome versions which is
- [21:52] definitely a point that a lot of people
- [21:54] have made. So Perplexity a lot of this
- [21:57] is like Perplexity's Comet. So we'll see
- [22:01] who makes a better product and who will
- [22:03] have the most users in the end.
- [22:05] Certainly, this is going to be very,
- [22:07] very similar to Comet, at least at first
- [22:09] glance. And it wrote a little video
- [22:11] intro script. Imagine a browser that
- [22:13] doesn't just take YouTube websites, but
- [22:15] actively helps you understand them.
- [22:17] Anyways, I think this is a solid A.
- [22:19] There's one minor detail where I think
- [22:21] if you make this, if you make Atlas your
- [22:24] default browser, you get higher rate
- [22:27] limits for 7 days. It's a minor detail,
- [22:29] but kind of an interesting one, right?
- [22:31] If you're experimenting with Fed, you
- [22:33] just click make this my default and that
- [22:35] gives you more read limits. I wish it
- [22:36] would have mentioned that. I don't see
- [22:38] that anywhere in here. But let me know
- [22:40] what you think. If you try it out, what
- [22:41] do you think about it? Are you going to
- [22:43] be using it actively? Is this something
- [22:45] that's going to be useful for you? How
- [22:47] is this going to affect perplexity and
- [22:49] comment? I'm looking forward to hearing
- [22:50] more from you. My initial impression of
- [22:52] this thing is that it's pretty dang
- [22:54] good. Specifically, I'm talking about
- [22:55] the agent mode. It's very powerful,
- [22:57] accurate, and actually does useful
- [22:59] stuff. Now, time will tell if this is
- [23:02] something I'm going be using daily or
- [23:03] not. A lot of the stuff kind of seems
- [23:06] very cool in the very beginning, but
- [23:07] then you just don't end up using it. So,
- [23:09] we'll do an update in a few weeks, but
- [23:12] just first glance, this thing is getting
- [23:15] better and better. And I feel like we're
- [23:16] beginning to cross into this territory
- [23:18] where it can actually do useful stuff
- [23:20] for you on your behalf. I haven't even
- [23:22] tried doing the filling out forms of it
- [23:24] or having it shop for me because again,
- [23:27] it needs to have a whole bunch of
- [23:28] information in there. But I feel like if
- [23:30] you use it and it has that context over
- [23:32] time, it will get to be very useful
- [23:35] where it actually saves you time. But
- [23:37] yeah, let me know what you think. Please
- [23:38] hit thumbs up. Make sure you're
- [23:39] subscribed. and I'll see you in the next
