- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] I hope everybody's following my langraph
- [00:06] crash course. Already part one of the
- [00:08] langraph crash course is uploaded where
- [00:10] we covered various topics um wherein we
- [00:14] need to understand about langraph
- [00:15] fundamentals. We built a applications.
- [00:18] We learned about MCP techniques, how to
- [00:19] build MCP server from scratch, you know,
- [00:22] how to work with multiple tools, how to
- [00:24] add memory, how to add human feedback in
- [00:26] the loop and many more things. Right now
- [00:28] in all this specific stuff you know uh
- [00:31] that was basically covered in part one.
- [00:33] Now in part two we had to probably go
- [00:35] ahead and learn about workflow and
- [00:36] agents multi- aent functional API and I
- [00:38] was about to do the recording. Okay. Now
- [00:41] before I thought before I record this
- [00:44] part two you know I have to make this
- [00:46] video uh that is uh what kind of
- [00:49] projects you should definitely make uh
- [00:52] if you are trying to get into generative
- [00:54] AI field you know and uh this question
- [00:56] is important because generative AI is
- [00:59] for every every every domain it is for
- [01:03] every kind of job roles a front-end
- [01:05] engineer wants to learn it a backend
- [01:07] engineer wants to learn it a data
- [01:08] scientist wants to learn it a AI
- [01:10] engineer wants to learn it. An ML
- [01:12] engineer wants to learn it because there
- [01:14] is a lot of scope in building
- [01:16] applications in a much more efficient
- [01:17] way because at the end of the day you
- [01:19] are integrating your applications with
- [01:20] LLM. You're integrating your application
- [01:22] with some external tools. You are
- [01:24] creating AI agents that will be able to
- [01:26] automate most of your task. Considering
- [01:29] this I thought of making this particular
- [01:31] video because after this video we will
- [01:33] continue the part two and then we will
- [01:35] try to link why I have why I'm trying to
- [01:37] cover all the specific topics and how uh
- [01:40] we will probably when we move to part
- [01:42] three how this will actually help you in
- [01:44] LLMOS pipeline deployments LLM
- [01:46] evaluation metrics and many more things.
- [01:48] Okay.
- [01:49] So let's say that uh you know you are
- [01:52] learning about generative AI you know
- [01:53] one thing is that once you specifically
- [01:55] learn what kind of projects you really
- [01:56] need to build at least to put in your
- [01:58] resume so that your interview process is
- [02:02] pretty much it goes in a much more
- [02:04] positive way you know because at the end
- [02:05] of the day what I've seen in most of the
- [02:07] interviews they focus on different kind
- [02:09] of project use cases and definitely with
- [02:12] the project use cases that you have
- [02:14] implemented right you can definitely
- [02:15] impress if you follow these things that
- [02:18] is happening This is from the recent
- [02:20] conversation that I've been having with
- [02:22] so many engineers out there who are
- [02:24] currently working as generative AI
- [02:25] engineers who are working in the agenti
- [02:27] field and many more things. Okay. And I
- [02:29] do communicate with a lot of people as
- [02:31] we do and parally we are also running
- [02:33] our own consultancy business you know
- [02:35] where we are talking with clients what
- [02:36] things they really want to implement
- [02:38] specifically in the field of generative
- [02:40] AI and agent engineering. Okay. So to
- [02:43] start with you know u let me just go
- [02:45] ahead like what kind of projects you
- [02:46] really need to build. If I talk one year
- [02:48] back, you know, agent uh generative AI
- [02:51] started becoming very popular, right? So
- [02:53] here I will go ahead and write ch AI.
- [02:56] Here I am going to probably go ahead and
- [02:58] write a right now with respect to
- [03:01] generative AI whenever we talk about you
- [03:04] know here obviously can create your
- [03:06] genai applications
- [03:09] right you can create traditional rags
- [03:13] which is really important use cases and
- [03:16] trust me guys right now most of the
- [03:18] companies you know they're focusing on
- [03:21] developing rag chat bots Okay,
- [03:26] rack chatbots like 80%age of the use
- [03:30] cases. Yeah, there are also many many
- [03:32] use cases that uh that are with respect
- [03:34] to computer vision and LP and all but
- [03:36] most of the companies are focusing on
- [03:38] this because this implementation in any
- [03:40] application gives a wow factor in the
- [03:42] application because recently I was just
- [03:44] talking to one of my client who is
- [03:46] running a business who is working with
- [03:48] some amazing automo companies you know
- [03:50] and they provide actual support to them
- [03:53] you know with respect to building their
- [03:54] own CRM they're just saying that kish
- [03:57] can you probably come and build some
- [03:58] kind of rack chat bots So that you know
- [04:01] we give a kind of amazing experience for
- [04:03] our end users in the automo company for
- [04:06] the client so that they can directly go
- [04:07] ahead and communicate with the chatbot
- [04:09] and get information out there. Okay. So
- [04:11] this is the kind of use cases and this
- [04:13] is use cases were just being built to
- [04:16] you know um at the end of the day they
- [04:18] really want to charge more to the
- [04:20] client. This is just a scenario by
- [04:22] providing the specific feature because
- [04:24] this is an additional feature. So
- [04:26] companies are thinking how they can
- [04:27] expand and provide that wow factor to
- [04:29] their product product so that they can
- [04:31] build more new things for them. Right?
- [04:33] So here when I talk about generative AI
- [04:35] applications you know building a basic
- [04:37] generative AI applications when you have
- [04:38] LLM solving a specific use cases that is
- [04:41] already there that was very popular last
- [04:43] year you know everybody was trying to
- [04:44] build everybody was also trying to build
- [04:46] some traditional rags right now if I see
- [04:50] in many companies now they are moving
- [04:51] from traditional rags to agentic rags
- [04:54] right and why they are moving because
- [04:56] now you have frameworks wherein you are
- [04:59] able to build agentic AI application so
- [05:01] right now guys if you are planning to
- [05:03] move into generative AI applications. If
- [05:05] you're learning, I know many of you are
- [05:07] specifically learning, you really need
- [05:08] to focus on this two modules, right?
- [05:10] Generative AI, a genetic AI, right? When
- [05:12] I talk about generative AI, you should
- [05:14] know how to work with LLM models. You
- [05:15] should know how to work with how to
- [05:18] integrate uh LLM models with respect to
- [05:20] generative AI application. How to work
- [05:22] with external tools, right? External
- [05:25] tools over here, right?
- [05:27] how to work with external tools, how to
- [05:29] bind them, how to work with pyic module,
- [05:32] right? Pidantic
- [05:34] pyic modules and all right and this is
- [05:37] becoming very much popular. I'm just
- [05:38] talking about some of the fundamental
- [05:40] things then I'll move towards what kind
- [05:41] of projects you should really build.
- [05:43] Okay. Then when you go to agentic AI in
- [05:46] agentic AI here the main aim is that to
- [05:49] create multi- multi-
- [05:53] AI agents right multiA agents right here
- [05:56] what is basically happening AI agents
- [05:58] are specifically communicating with each
- [06:01] other it's just like you are you have a
- [06:03] complex workflow of task and you're
- [06:05] dividing those task between agents and
- [06:08] agents are working together to solve
- [06:10] that particular uh workflow or task to
- [06:12] achieve that goal Right. So that is why
- [06:14] agentic AI applications become very very
- [06:16] much famous. You have lot of uh lot of
- [06:20] libraries like langraph CUI you know you
- [06:23] have uh applications like let's say
- [06:26] langraph CUI you also have Agno you have
- [06:29] so many different different frameworks
- [06:30] that are actually helping you in this.
- [06:32] So guys now let's talk about what kind
- [06:34] of projects you really need to build.
- [06:35] Okay. And I definitely want to see this
- [06:39] kind of projects in your resume. At
- [06:40] least you should have that kind of
- [06:41] resume uh projects in your resume. So
- [06:43] that your interviewer definitely will be
- [06:45] impressed. The first project as I said
- [06:47] more than 90% 80% of your use cases
- [06:50] focus on rags in any company right now
- [06:53] rag basically means
- [06:55] retrieval
- [06:58] augmented generation right
- [07:02] retrieval augmented generation and just
- [07:05] to give you an idea I'm also building a
- [07:07] specific product with rag soon uh in my
- [07:09] company we had started doing a lot of
- [07:11] research on this uh we are trying to
- [07:13] create a generic framework wherein from
- [07:15] data parsing to you know data injection
- [07:18] to probably converting that into vector
- [07:20] stores uh you know storing it in some
- [07:23] kind of databases and you providing a
- [07:24] specific kind of response or getting a
- [07:26] specific kind of response becomes much
- [07:28] more accurate. So that kind of product
- [07:30] uh we are specifically working. Now with
- [07:33] respect to rags there are two things see
- [07:35] one is with respect to different kind of
- [07:39] data right your data may be in txt
- [07:41] format it can be in pdf format it can be
- [07:43] in some website format right so in the
- [07:47] racks if you are specifically writing in
- [07:49] your resume like what all things you
- [07:51] basically did in rags okay so in rags
- [07:53] definitely there are some components one
- [07:57] is data parsing since I said that in
- [08:00] rags whenever you implement any use
- [08:02] cases your data will be in different
- [08:04] different kind of uh in in a different
- [08:06] different data source I'll consider this
- [08:07] as my data source now from this data
- [08:09] source how you are specifically doing
- [08:11] the data parsing how in which format you
- [08:14] are basically converting this how you
- [08:16] adding all the metadata and how
- [08:18] accurately you are adding all the
- [08:20] metadata that is really important right
- [08:22] now many companies are focusing on
- [08:23] implementing good good data parsing
- [08:25] modules you know and they are serving it
- [08:27] to the client second thing is that after
- [08:30] implementing data parsing you already
- [08:32] have text embedding techniques for this
- [08:35] already. They are so amazing LLMA model.
- [08:37] So here uh you can directly use this
- [08:40] text embedding techniques from the LLM.
- [08:42] Let's say for example you have OpenAI,
- [08:44] you have Google Germany and all you can
- [08:46] use directly from this right you have
- [08:48] various models. Third, which vector
- [08:51] databases you are specifically using and
- [08:53] how you're using it. Right now, client
- [08:57] or interviewer at the end, right, will
- [08:59] definitely be interested like see it's
- [09:01] not like you just create a vector
- [09:02] database in the um in the cloud and just
- [09:06] try to use it, give an input, get an
- [09:08] output. No, in vector databases also
- [09:11] there is a concept of categorization.
- [09:13] Why do we specifically use
- [09:14] categorization? you know um if I really
- [09:17] want to have a efficient retrieval
- [09:20] system how do I probably go ahead and do
- [09:22] this you know everything should be
- [09:24] implemented in this once you
- [09:26] specifically have the knowledge of this
- [09:28] you will be able to talk about it
- [09:30] because at the end of the day you need
- [09:31] to talk about projects itself then
- [09:33] coming to the fourth important thing
- [09:35] right if I talk about vector databases
- [09:37] I've understood you have understood that
- [09:39] okay these all things are there then the
- [09:41] next thing is that how you are able to
- [09:44] create a persist consistent memory over
- [09:46] here whenever you are creating this rag
- [09:48] system. Right? Now when I talk about
- [09:50] rag, they have different varieties of
- [09:52] rag. There is corrective rag, there is
- [09:54] adaptive rag, you know, and obviously
- [09:56] now everybody should move from
- [09:58] traditional rag to agentic rag, you
- [10:00] know, adaptive rag, there is agentic
- [10:02] rag. So start exploring multiple
- [10:05] different kind of rags and how memory is
- [10:08] managed in this kind of rags. That is
- [10:11] important because in interviewers they
- [10:12] will focus on this kind of questions.
- [10:14] Okay. So this is really really much
- [10:16] important and everybody if you do not
- [10:19] have a rag project in your resume trust
- [10:22] me it will be difficult to crack any job
- [10:24] interview because companies are directly
- [10:26] interested in this. Okay. Then comes in
- [10:30] uh like in this kind of projects. The
- [10:31] second thing that I really want to talk
- [10:33] about is rags is definitely there right.
- [10:36] Second there should be projects wherein
- [10:38] you should focus on creating AI agents.
- [10:41] Okay, AI agents, it can be a single AI
- [10:44] agent. It can be multiple AI agents,
- [10:47] right? So, multiple AI agents or agentic
- [10:50] AI applications, you should start
- [10:52] building
- [10:54] agentic AI applications. Now the best
- [10:56] thing about this agentic application is
- [10:58] that any normal process let's say for
- [11:02] solving a use case you know so in in
- [11:06] recently you know one of the hackathon
- [11:08] that we conducted in our last agentic AI
- [11:10] batch we told that hey for the software
- [11:13] development life cycle right see
- [11:15] whenever how do we solve a software
- [11:17] development life cycle with the help of
- [11:18] AI from business gathering to
- [11:20] requirement gathering you know to like
- [11:22] how a business analyst work how a
- [11:24] product manager work you
- [11:26] uh how that requirement gathering is
- [11:27] basically taken converted into a report.
- [11:29] How the coding is basically done, how
- [11:31] the unit testing is done. We tried to
- [11:33] automate the entire HDLC by building an
- [11:36] agentic AI application and the best part
- [11:38] was that so many people were able to
- [11:41] develop this and here we also integrated
- [11:45] with human feedback. This is just one
- [11:47] example, right? So companies are also
- [11:51] looking for building this kind of
- [11:52] agentic AI application. At the end of
- [11:54] the day here you are trying to just
- [11:57] solve a comic uh your complex workflow
- [12:00] right and this complex workflow is just
- [12:02] to solve a uh real world problem
- [12:04] statement right just for an example
- [12:07] let's say I want to probably say this
- [12:09] scenario I had in my previous use cases
- [12:11] also and I usually say this particular
- [12:13] scenario to everyone even in my classes
- [12:15] and all I want to convert my YouTube
- [12:18] video into a blog right so for this I
- [12:22] had to probably work with two uh I had
- [12:25] to hire two interns to do this specific
- [12:27] work. Now I've converted this into an
- [12:29] agentic AI application which is being
- [12:32] able to do this entire process in a much
- [12:34] more easier way. Right? And this is the
- [12:36] best thing about agentic AI
- [12:38] applications. You know you here you try
- [12:40] to automate things because LLM has that
- [12:42] capability for doing this text part,
- [12:45] coding part, uh reporting part, document
- [12:48] analysis part, many more things as such.
- [12:50] Right? So you can automate definitely by
- [12:52] creating an agent application. Right? Uh
- [12:54] so you should definitely focus on this
- [12:56] right now. Whenever you are trying to
- [12:58] create this agent AI application, my one
- [13:00] very important topic that you should
- [13:02] learn is about MCP servers. You should
- [13:04] know how to build MCP servers from
- [13:06] scratch. You should basically know how
- [13:08] to uh use MCP servers with various
- [13:10] various frameworks. As you know, MCP is
- [13:13] basically come up by anthropic, right?
- [13:15] And many many companies are now focusing
- [13:17] on building their own MCP server so that
- [13:19] you can integrate it easily with their
- [13:21] application and at the end of the day
- [13:23] you'll be able to charge them uh you
- [13:25] know and obviously the companies will
- [13:26] also be able to earn much more money
- [13:28] right so there are different different
- [13:29] MCP servers from tab to do go searchers
- [13:32] there are more than 300 400 plus MCP
- [13:34] servers the reason why I'm telling you
- [13:36] to probably integrate all these things
- [13:38] in your project because this will be
- [13:40] very much helpful in answering a lot of
- [13:42] questions and definitely the interviewer
- [13:44] will be very much impressed by you with
- [13:46] respect to the kind of work that you
- [13:47] have done. If you are covering this two
- [13:49] main thing that will be more than
- [13:51] sufficient. Now comes to the next two
- [13:53] block why you have created this
- [13:54] particular next two blocks. Right? This
- [13:57] block is basically for two important
- [13:58] things. One is debugging and monitoring.
- [14:02] Debugging and monitoring
- [14:05] and the third one is specifically with
- [14:07] respect to deployments.
- [14:09] Okay. Now debugging and monitoring means
- [14:12] what? See whenever we try to create this
- [14:14] complex workflows you know you should
- [14:16] have techniques of debugging things
- [14:18] right some of the platform that I would
- [14:20] like to mention is like lang right lang
- [14:22] is a tool that is provided uh it is like
- [14:24] a cloud platform that is provided by
- [14:26] langraph where you can specifically do
- [14:28] debugging if you want to go ahead and
- [14:29] much more open source then I hope
- [14:31] everybody has heard about mlflow right
- [14:33] with mlflow you will be able to do
- [14:35] amazing things you'll be able to uh
- [14:37] specifically do the tracing you'll be
- [14:40] able to do the tracking uh which API
- [14:42] call is basically made, how much tokens
- [14:44] has been generated. The same thing you
- [14:45] can also do it with lang. But you know
- [14:47] lang when you are specifically working
- [14:49] with the enterprises right that time
- [14:51] there will be some kind kind of charges
- [14:53] based on the request but MLflow you can
- [14:55] deploy it in any kind of clouds like EC2
- [14:57] instance and all and you can
- [14:58] specifically use for doing this tracing
- [15:00] and tracking right and whenever we talk
- [15:02] about deployments there is also one more
- [15:04] very important thing which is called as
- [15:06] LLM evaluation metrics
- [15:09] evaluation metrics. So once you have
- [15:11] this LLM evaluation metrics, you know,
- [15:13] there are nine different evaluation
- [15:16] metrics that we can specifically use. I
- [15:19] hope many people did not know this but
- [15:21] don't worry in the part two you know I
- [15:24] will start talking about debug and
- [15:26] monitoring and I'll also make a video on
- [15:28] LLM evaluation metrics with the help of
- [15:31] MLflow.
- [15:33] Okay, with the help of MLflow and you
- [15:35] will be like wow this is amazing. We'll
- [15:37] try to use all the nine important
- [15:39] metrics to do that you know and this
- [15:41] this important experience if you add it
- [15:44] in your resume like I know how to
- [15:46] probably go ahead and do debugging and
- [15:47] monitoring let's say in lansmith there
- [15:49] is something called as langraph studio
- [15:51] okay lang graph studio and with the help
- [15:53] of langraph studio you will be able to
- [15:54] see the entire workflow in action right
- [15:57] which is really really much amazing
- [15:59] right so we will be focusing even on
- [16:01] debugging and monitoring along with that
- [16:03] LLM evaluation metrics and finally we'll
- [16:05] try to see some of the deployment
- [16:06] techniques again here we are going to
- [16:08] use the CI/CD pipeline this two part
- [16:11] that you'll be able to see it's more
- [16:12] towards LLM ops right LLM ops so
- [16:16] initially it was MLOps but since we are
- [16:19] now working with LLM models it is termed
- [16:22] as LLM ops which is also one of the
- [16:24] major requirement see at the end of the
- [16:26] day why I'm specifically creating all
- [16:28] these things because people just focus
- [16:29] on this two modules most of the time
- [16:31] they don't focus on this again focusing
- [16:34] on these two specific modules will give
- [16:35] you an upper hand when compared to the
- [16:37] other people out there right so it is
- [16:39] necessary you start creating this and at
- [16:40] least have this two kind of projects
- [16:42] where you are creating about AI agents
- [16:44] and all and also make sure while you're
- [16:46] creating chat bots at the end of the day
- [16:48] you'll be creating chat bots right in
- [16:50] the chat bots how do you manage memory
- [16:52] that is also really really much
- [16:53] important so I hope you like this
- [16:55] particular video this was the video that
- [16:57] I really wanted to create before I
- [16:58] upload part two so that it gives you an
- [17:00] idea what all kind of projects you
- [17:02] should definitely have in your resume
- [17:04] for generative AI so yes this was it for
- [17:06] my side. I'll see you in the next video.
- [17:07] Thank you.
