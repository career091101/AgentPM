- [00:00] are you tired of manually coding every
- [00:01] app yourself do you wish an AI could do
- [00:04] all the work for you automatically well
- [00:06] now it can with the release of DEA a
- [00:08] local open source e agine that can
- [00:10] literally work for you just write an
- [00:12] instruction press enter and see thei
- [00:14] agine start to work automatically by
- [00:16] writing a precise plan on how to execute
- [00:18] the task then bring the web by itself
- [00:20] and Gathering informations before
- [00:22] automatically writing the code and
- [00:24] creating local project files in your
- [00:26] computer folder that you can then run
- [00:28] and admire the result results and all of
- [00:31] that running on your local computer yeah
- [00:33] that's pretty cool en hum when we scare
- [00:36] your air overload and oh man this is
- [00:38] just amazing now as you saw in the intro
- [00:41] defa is an open source AI software that
- [00:43] can literally build any apps or programs
- [00:46] you want just by giving it an
- [00:47] instruction now you might have heard of
- [00:49] this AI tool called Devon a few weeks
- [00:51] back that was introduced as the first AI
- [00:53] software engineer where you inputed
- [00:55] instruction and it would then write an
- [00:57] action plan then go online and gather
- [00:59] information
- [01:00] before doing the rest of the task
- [01:02] automatically and it looked pretty
- [01:04] amazing but unfortunately Devon is a
- [01:06] third party software while Deva is an
- [01:09] open-source EI tool that tries to mimic
- [01:12] what Deon can do but this time running
- [01:14] locally on your computer where you can
- [01:16] even use local large language models
- [01:19] like the Lama 3 Model that just came out
- [01:22] and the way it looks and works really
- [01:23] gives us a glimpse of how an AGI agent
- [01:26] might work in the near future so even
- [01:28] though it's still a work in progress
- [01:30] this is some seriously heavy amazing
- [01:32] stuff and so to install this you have
- [01:35] two ways the first is of course by using
- [01:36] the one click installer that is
- [01:38] available for M supporters so just
- [01:40] download the installer onto your
- [01:41] computer then double click it then after
- [01:43] the installation is done you're going to
- [01:44] place the launcher devb file inside the
- [01:47] DEA folder go inside and then run the
- [01:49] launcher so that in the end it should
- [01:51] give you a local host URL and if you
- [01:53] press control and left click the wavei
- [01:55] will open automatically in your browser
- [01:57] simple as that you really don't have to
- [01:58] do anything and def installation is
- [02:01] actually pretty complex and it took me a
- [02:02] while to make it work so believe me what
- [02:04] I say that the one click installer is
- [02:06] definitely super practical and the
- [02:08] second way to install this is of course
- [02:09] the manual way so first make sure that
- [02:11] you have python G for Windows and not.
- [02:14] GS installed so then you're going to
- [02:16] open a command promp window and type
- [02:17] Powershell c irm b.
- [02:21] Shinall PS1 IEX then you're going to
- [02:24] press enter this will basically download
- [02:26] an install butn then you can close the
- [02:28] window next you're going to Lo the Deva
- [02:30] repository so you're going to go to the
- [02:32] Deva GitHub page click on code then
- [02:34] you're going to click on the S icon to
- [02:35] copy this entire name then back in your
- [02:37] computer in an empty folder you're going
- [02:39] to click on the folder path type CMD
- [02:41] press enter this will BR the command
- [02:43] promp window and then here you're going
- [02:44] to type get clone and then you're going
- [02:46] to paste the URL of the repository and
- [02:48] then you're going to press enter and
- [02:49] this will clone the Deva repository onto
- [02:51] your computer by creating this small
- [02:53] Deva folder so the next we're going to
- [02:55] go inside that folder so you're going to
- [02:56] type CG Deva then once we are inside
- [02:58] we're going to create a virtual
- [02:59] environment with this command line then
- [03:01] next we're going to activate the
- [03:03] environment now once the environment is
- [03:04] activated we're going to install pytorch
- [03:06] with this huge command line once this is
- [03:09] done we're going to install requirements
- [03:10] with this command PP install SLR
- [03:13] requirements.txt okay so the next we're
- [03:15] going to install Play rate with this
- [03:16] command so then we're going to install
- [03:18] npm so then once this is done we're
- [03:20] going to go inside the UI folder with
- [03:22] the CD UI command then you're going to
- [03:24] type bur install and bur add Vite and
- [03:27] finally once this is done it's was over
- [03:30] to start de you need to run two
- [03:32] different parts the front end and the
- [03:34] back end now for the front end once you
- [03:36] are inside the UI folder you're going to
- [03:38] run Bun Run start then press enter which
- [03:41] after a few seconds should give you a
- [03:43] local URL but this is not over because
- [03:46] now we need to run the back end so we
- [03:48] are back inside the DEA folder then once
- [03:50] again you're going to click on the
- [03:51] folder path type CMD press enter so then
- [03:54] here you're going to activate the
- [03:55] environment and then you're going to run
- [03:56] the Deva py file and once you see the
- [03:58] message Deva is and running you can open
- [04:00] the Local Host URL and now DEA is
- [04:03] finally ready to be used okay so now we
- [04:05] can finally have some fun or is it
- [04:08] because indeed unfortunately we're not
- [04:10] exactly 100% done because to be able to
- [04:13] use like a bunch of different models
- [04:15] ranging from clo to Gro to CH GPT and to
- [04:18] be able to serve the web we need to add
- [04:21] our own API keys but do wor it's
- [04:23] actually really simple you only need to
- [04:25] do it once and after that you are good
- [04:28] so once again if you want to find the
- [04:29] API I Keys settings all you need to do
- [04:31] is just click on this little settings
- [04:33] icon and we can finally start completing
- [04:35] a few of these fields now depending the
- [04:38] type of models that you want to use you
- [04:39] will here enter the API key
- [04:41] corresponding to the model but the two
- [04:43] fields that you always need to complete
- [04:45] is the Google search and the Google
- [04:47] search engine ID because otherwise
- [04:49] without that you won't be able to go
- [04:51] online but once again it's actually
- [04:53] really easy and really fast and I'm
- [04:54] going to show you how so for the first
- [04:56] Google search field you're going to go
- [04:58] to this URL developer . google.com
- [05:00] custom search V1 introduction then right
- [05:03] here you'll see like a get a key button
- [05:05] you're going to click on this then
- [05:06] you're going to enter your project name
- [05:08] then click yes click next okay so then
- [05:10] after a few seconds you will get here
- [05:12] the ability to show the key so if you
- [05:13] click on this little button you will
- [05:15] have here your API key that you can copy
- [05:17] make sure that you actually save this
- [05:19] key somewhere else on your computer for
- [05:20] example so that you don't have to look
- [05:22] for it and then inside Deva you're going
- [05:24] to click on edit and then you're going
- [05:25] to erase this entire field and then
- [05:27] paste your API right here and there you
- [05:29] go that's it's already one field done so
- [05:31] the next field we have Google search
- [05:32] engine ID and for this you need to go to
- [05:35] this URL programmable Search engine.
- [05:37] google.com control panel /all where here
- [05:40] you're going to click on add to add a
- [05:42] new search engine then you're going to
- [05:43] name DEA or something else here you're
- [05:46] going to select search the entire web
- [05:48] and then enable image search click I'm
- [05:50] not a robot if you're not a robot and
- [05:52] then finally click create and once this
- [05:54] is done you're going to go back to all
- [05:55] engines select your search engine and
- [05:58] then here you will see your search
- [05:59] engine Eng ID then click on this little
- [06:01] icon to copy this entire ID so then once
- [06:03] again back in DEA you're going to erase
- [06:05] this entire field paste your API and
- [06:08] there you go so once you have filled
- [06:09] those Google search Fields now it's kind
- [06:11] of up to you to decide which model you
- [06:13] really want to use do you want to use
- [06:15] the Clone model do you want to use the C
- [06:17] GPT model the giny the gro etc etc now
- [06:20] definitely the two models that I
- [06:22] recommend that work the best are the
- [06:23] close model API and the open AI apis
- [06:26] basically the more powerful the model
- [06:28] the better the result results so
- [06:30] basically once again on both of these
- [06:32] platforms just create a new secret key
- [06:34] or a new API key and then put in the
- [06:36] field corresponding to the model so once
- [06:38] this is done you're going to click on
- [06:39] Save and now finally we can have some
- [06:42] fun and the way you start is very simple
- [06:44] first you're going to create a new
- [06:45] project so you're going to click on the
- [06:47] little arrow then click new project here
- [06:49] you're going to input the project name
- [06:51] so for example let's say that I want a
- [06:53] select game so then I'm going to press
- [06:55] okay so then here under select search
- [06:57] engine you're going to select Google and
- [06:59] then under select model you can finally
- [07:01] select the model that you want to use so
- [07:03] if you have a clo API key you can use
- [07:05] between the clo three oppus Sonet and
- [07:08] Hau so the oppus is the most powerful
- [07:10] while the Hau is the least powerful but
- [07:12] they're still really really good then
- [07:14] you can also choose a Google Model A Gro
- [07:16] model a mistra Model A local model or a
- [07:19] CH GPT model so like for this example
- [07:21] I'm just going to use the GPT 3.5 turbo
- [07:23] so the next you're going to enter your
- [07:24] project you're going to enter what you
- [07:26] want Deva to create for you so it Mak it
- [07:28] about a simple SN game in Python so then
- [07:31] if I press enter just like in the intro
- [07:33] is going to create a plan of what he is
- [07:35] going to do then it's going to browse
- [07:37] the web to research some information you
- [07:39] can basically see like what websites he
- [07:41] uses for the information which is
- [07:43] actually really really cool and after it
- [07:45] has research or the information it needs
- [07:47] to make the project is going to start
- [07:50] writing the code automatically and
- [07:51] finally the project will be created and
- [07:53] to have access to that project you're
- [07:55] going to go and send the data folder
- [07:57] then projects and then you will see here
- [07:58] a new folder called snake and once you
- [08:00] go inside you will see three different
- [08:02] files sometimes it's only two but very
- [08:05] usually with python project you will see
- [08:06] like a main.py file and the
- [08:08] requirements.txt file and to open the
- [08:11] project you can either do it manually or
- [08:13] if you are one of my PCT supporters you
- [08:15] will have access to the project
- [08:16] launcher. bat file which is really just
- [08:18] a simple bat file then you can just copy
- [08:20] and then paste ins sign each one of your
- [08:22] projects folder and if you launch it the
- [08:24] project will then launch automatically
- [08:26] and if you want to do it manually the
- [08:28] first time that you want to launch the
- [08:29] project project you're going to click on
- [08:30] the folder path type CMD press enter
- [08:33] here you're going to install the
- [08:34] requirements from the text file and then
- [08:36] to launch the python project you're
- [08:37] going to type Python man. py and then
- [08:40] press enter and there you go the simple
- [08:42] snake game is finally ready to be played
- [08:45] so as you can see each time that I
- [08:47] basically eat this Red Cube my snake
- [08:50] becomes bigger and of course the more I
- [08:52] eat the longer the snake gets and what's
- [08:54] really great is that if you want to make
- [08:55] any changes to the game you can go back
- [08:58] in s DEA and ask for some changes so for
- [09:01] example let's say that I want uh to make
- [09:03] this snake game faster and to change the
- [09:05] background color to light blue for
- [09:07] example basically Diva will
- [09:08] automatically update the game code and
- [09:10] update the files because now if you
- [09:12] relaunch the project all the changes
- [09:14] have been implementated correctly okay
- [09:16] I'm maybe not a fan of the uh you know
- [09:18] background but you know it was just a
- [09:20] test to show you that you know basically
- [09:22] it just works so obviously it's still a
- [09:24] work in progress It's not perfect but
- [09:26] it's still pretty cool and if you're
- [09:28] asking is there a way way to actually
- [09:30] use DEA with local models running on
- [09:32] your computer for free well the answer
- [09:35] is yes and no what I mean by that is
- [09:39] that yes you can actually use local
- [09:41] models and I'm going to show you how to
- [09:42] do it but as of right now not only you
- [09:44] need to install another version of DEA
- [09:47] at least as of right now as I'm making
- [09:49] this video but you also need to
- [09:51] understand that the model that you
- [09:52] choose needs to be powerful enough and
- [09:54] smart enough to do your task so that the
- [09:56] project is done successfully now the
- [09:58] problem is that currently a lot of local
- [10:00] models have kind of like the same
- [10:02] problem the same issues where each time
- [10:04] that you want to use it it gives you
- [10:06] like this invalid response from the
- [10:08] model trying again error again and again
- [10:10] and again so that in the end basically
- [10:12] you get absolutely no answer in return
- [10:15] but I'm actually going to show you how
- [10:16] to solve this now to be able to use
- [10:18] local models with DEA you actually need
- [10:20] to install another version of DEA where
- [10:22] the local model bgs have been solved
- [10:24] although probably by the time that you
- [10:26] watch this video the changes will
- [10:27] already be merged into the main Deva
- [10:29] repository but if you are watching this
- [10:32] video right now like today these changes
- [10:35] have not been implemented already so for
- [10:37] this you need to actually install this
- [10:39] version of DEA with this particular
- [10:41] Branch to be able to use the local
- [10:43] models correctly now you can of course
- [10:45] either do it yourself manually or if you
- [10:47] are one of my P supporters you can just
- [10:49] use the DEA Auto installer or Lama fixb
- [10:52] file to install that version of DEA
- [10:54] automatically and once you do and you
- [10:56] have installed this new version of DEA
- [10:58] we need to install a super amazing cool
- [11:00] piece of tech called ol Lama now I was
- [11:03] thinking of making a separate video on
- [11:04] this because it's kind of like the
- [11:06] easiest way to run ANM on your computer
- [11:08] but since there isn't a lot to say I
- [11:10] ended up not making the video after all
- [11:13] so I'm actually really happy to be able
- [11:14] to talk about this and show you how it
- [11:16] works because it's actually really super
- [11:18] cool so basically if you want to install
- [11:20] all Lama you can just click in the
- [11:22] description down below then click on
- [11:24] download download for Windows then
- [11:26] you're going to run the x file and
- [11:27] install all Lama and once this is done
- [11:29] you're going to click on models and
- [11:31] search a model that you want to download
- [11:33] and use so like for example the latest L
- [11:35] 3 Model that was just released to be
- [11:37] able to download and use Lama 3 on your
- [11:40] computer with all Lama all you need to
- [11:41] do is open a command promp window copy
- [11:44] this new command then paste it then it's
- [11:47] going to download the L 3 Model to your
- [11:48] computer and then it's going to start
- [11:50] the model automatically and yeah um what
- [11:53] you see right here is actually Lama 3
- [11:55] running on my computer inside the
- [11:57] command Pro window so if i s like hi uh
- [12:00] very simply and very fast the Lama 3
- [12:02] Model is going to respond what's up my
- [12:04] dude and yeah I mean there you go simple
- [12:07] as that and if you want to use like
- [12:09] another model you can just again go back
- [12:11] to this list and let's say for example
- [12:13] that I want to use the latest 33 model
- [12:17] open sourced by Microsoft which
- [12:19] apparently is a very good model once
- [12:21] again just click on this link open a
- [12:22] Comm promp window type this command then
- [12:24] press enter it's going to start
- [12:26] downloading the model and after a few
- [12:27] minutes once the model is downloaded the
- [12:29] model will start automatically and you
- [12:31] can start to use it right now okay so
- [12:33] now that this is done now that we have
- [12:35] downloaded a few AMA models how do we
- [12:37] use this inside DEA so once again you're
- [12:40] going to launch the new DEA version if
- [12:42] you did everything correctly you should
- [12:44] now see all Lama available meaning that
- [12:47] all Lama was downloaded and installed
- [12:49] correctly now go back to the web UI and
- [12:51] once you have entered the Google search
- [12:53] and Google search engine ID in the apis
- [12:56] key section now you can create a new
- [12:58] project select Google gole for the
- [12:59] search engine and then finally select a
- [13:01] model if you scroll down you will see
- [13:03] under all Lama all the models that you
- [13:05] downloaded previously now obviously
- [13:08] depending on how powerful the model is
- [13:10] the final result will be more or less
- [13:13] good so like for example if I choose
- [13:14] like L 3 so if I ask something you like
- [13:16] an app in Python that generates secure
- [13:18] random passwords and if I press enter
- [13:21] once again it will work pretty much the
- [13:22] same way as if we were using a cloud
- [13:25] model like it to create a step-by-step
- [13:27] plan then it's going to search the web
- [13:28] for information then it's going to write
- [13:30] the code and now if you go to data then
- [13:32] projects you will see like this main py
- [13:35] file but now if I run it I did get like
- [13:37] a random generated password with a bunch
- [13:40] of different characters uppercase and
- [13:42] lowercase letters that I can use for a
- [13:44] bunch of websites so yeah I mean it's
- [13:46] not fancy but at least it works and once
- [13:49] again everything was done locally this
- [13:51] was done with a local model running on
- [13:53] my local computer inside an open source
- [13:56] local tool I mean yeah that's pretty
- [13:58] cool and it's still working project so
- [14:00] as everybody says it is the worst
- [14:02] version it will ever be so I really
- [14:04] cannot wait once this becomes even
- [14:06] better so yeah really super cool oh and
- [14:08] also do not forget that I provide
- [14:10] priority support for my Pat supporters
- [14:12] so if you have any questions whatsoever
- [14:14] do not hesitate to send me a DM and I
- [14:16] will try to answer your question as soon
- [14:17] as possible the link for the patreon
- [14:19] will be in the description down below
- [14:20] and yeah there you go this was the vaa
- [14:22] and local open source tool that is
- [14:24] aiming to become the next AI software
- [14:27] engineer and although it's still a
- [14:28] working progress the way it works and
- [14:30] looks can really give us a glimpse to
- [14:32] the Future on how future AGI agents will
