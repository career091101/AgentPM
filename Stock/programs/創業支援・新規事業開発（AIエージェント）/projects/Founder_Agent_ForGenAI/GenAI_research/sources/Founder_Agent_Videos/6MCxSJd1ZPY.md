- [00:00] Can AI protect you from hackers? In this
- [00:02] video, I'll show you free AI agents for
- [00:05] cyber security that you must have. And
- [00:07] that's because the amount of AI powered
- [00:09] cyber attacks is on the rise. This year
- [00:11] alone, over 166 million individuals were
- [00:15] affected by cyber attacks. But it only
- [00:17] gets worse because AI powered attacks
- [00:20] have a four time higher success rate
- [00:22] than traditional fishing. For example,
- [00:24] new techniques like AI voice spoofing
- [00:26] where people can clone your voice and
- [00:28] call your bank, call your relatives and
- [00:30] extract money are becoming everyday
- [00:32] occurrence. And the truth is most people
- [00:34] have no idea how to guard against these.
- [00:36] Also, let's be honest, for a lot of us,
- [00:38] our digital life is slowly becoming more
- [00:40] important than our physical one. Now, we
- [00:42] all understand the importance of cyber
- [00:44] security, but the truth is most people
- [00:46] don't do anything about it. And that's
- [00:48] why I put together an AI first cyber
- [00:51] security course for 2026. I'll show you
- [00:53] the free AI agents that manage my own
- [00:55] cyber security and how to set them up.
- [00:57] And the best part is you only set them
- [00:59] up once and they run forever acting as
- [01:02] your digital bodyguards in a sense. Now,
- [01:04] just by having these free AI agents,
- [01:05] you'll already be ahead of 99% of people
- [01:08] when it comes to the cyber security. And
- [01:10] no, you don't have to be a professional
- [01:12] programmer to set these up. Now, the
- [01:14] first thing you have to understand about
- [01:15] cyber security is that most hacks and
- [01:18] breaches are not some crazy hacker
- [01:20] targeting you or some new zero day
- [01:22] attack. It's the stupidest things,
- [01:24] right? Such as social engineering,
- [01:26] someone pretending to be you and calling
- [01:28] your bank or just simple fishing links
- [01:30] that you accidentally click. Now, this
- [01:32] is actually good news because in order
- [01:34] to protect yourself against most hacks,
- [01:36] like 95% of cyber attacks, you don't
- [01:38] need to be a cyber security
- [01:40] professional. You just need to follow a
- [01:41] few basic things which we will cover in
- [01:43] this video. So pay attention. Number
- [01:45] one, setting up authenticator apps and
- [01:47] not SMS. SMS is not safe. A lot of you
- [01:50] are using SMS for two-factor
- [01:52] authentication. But what you don't
- [01:53] realize is that people can spoof your
- [01:55] SIM card and steal your two F8 codes
- [01:57] relatively easily. So instead of SMS,
- [01:59] you should use a proper authenticator
- [02:00] app like Google off one password off.
- [02:04] Doesn't matter. Use a proper off app,
- [02:06] not SMS. This already makes it much more
- [02:08] difficult to break into any accounts
- [02:10] rather than just having a single
- [02:11] password or password and SMS. Lesson
- [02:14] number two is to protect yourself
- [02:16] against fishing. Now fishing is usually
- [02:18] fake emails or messaging pretending to
- [02:20] be from companies that you trust. Your
- [02:22] bank, Amazon, Microsoft to steal
- [02:24] passwords or install malware. Now
- [02:26] actually the way to protect against
- [02:27] fishing is super simple and it's a
- [02:30] 3-second thing. So anytime you see a
- [02:32] link that is suspicious or something
- [02:33] that's hyperl, just hover over it. Do
- [02:35] not click right away. Hover your mouse
- [02:37] over it and look in the bottom left of
- [02:38] your screen to see the actual redirect
- [02:41] URL. This will allow you to see where
- [02:42] the link actually wants to take you. And
- [02:44] if you think fishing attacks are a thing
- [02:46] of the past, think again because just
- [02:48] last week there was a huge fishing wave
- [02:51] hitting Pi Pi maintainers. And these are
- [02:53] actually professional developers. So
- [02:54] these are not dummies. These guys are
- [02:56] serious programmers and they were still
- [02:57] compromised. What happened is that the
- [02:59] hackers were emailing the developers and
- [03:01] maintainers of this Python package with
- [03:04] fake verify your email or account
- [03:06] suspended messages. So if anything has
- [03:09] some kind of urgency like quickly change
- [03:11] your password or your account is about
- [03:12] to be disabled, pay attention because
- [03:14] it's most likely a scam. If you see a
- [03:16] link and you are not sure if it's good
- [03:17] or not, just paste it into Vid Total
- [03:19] before clicking it. So, if you don't
- [03:21] know what V total is, it's a free
- [03:22] website that allows you to analyze
- [03:24] files, URLs, or just search to see if
- [03:27] something is malicious or if it's legit.
- [03:28] But let's be honest, pasting every
- [03:30] single link that you see into V total is
- [03:33] a lot of manual work. And you still
- [03:34] might sometimes miss it and click it on
- [03:36] accident. Which is why I built an AI
- [03:38] agent for this to automate the fishing
- [03:40] analysis of every single email that hits
- [03:43] your inbox. And the real beauty of this
- [03:45] AI agent is that you set it up once and
- [03:47] it runs forever, which makes you much
- [03:49] less likely to fall for any fishing
- [03:51] scams compared to the average person.
- [03:53] All right, so let's jump into NA10 and
- [03:55] let's look at it. Now, if you don't know
- [03:56] what NA10 is, it's basically the
- [03:58] simplest way to build AI agents. In
- [04:00] fact, it's so simple that you don't have
- [04:02] to be a programmer at all to start
- [04:03] building. It's literally drag and drop.
- [04:05] So, let me explain this AI agent. On the
- [04:08] first glance, it might look complicated,
- [04:09] but it's much simpler than you think.
- [04:10] And we're going to start by running the
- [04:12] full workflow. So, let me click on
- [04:13] execute workflow. It's going to fetch an
- [04:15] email and then run it through the whole
- [04:17] agent analyzing it through multiple
- [04:19] different sites. So, let's break it
- [04:20] down. Gmail trigger, pretty
- [04:22] self-explanatory. It runs on your email
- [04:24] and it checks your inbox every minute to
- [04:26] see if there's any new emails that you
- [04:28] received that haven't been checked yet.
- [04:30] Then, it sends the email content into
- [04:32] this node which splits it into batches
- [04:34] in case there is multiple URLs. Now, it
- [04:36] seems like the AI agent has finished
- [04:37] running. So, in a second, I'll show you
- [04:39] the results of it. But first, let me
- [04:41] explain this code block because this is
- [04:43] where a lot of people get intimidated.
- [04:44] And it's actually very simple. We just
- [04:46] use regular expressions with a short
- [04:48] Python script, which by the way, I got
- [04:50] Claude to write. So you don't have to do
- [04:51] any programming yourself. All you need
- [04:53] to do is ask like, write me a simple
- [04:55] script that parses raw body of a Gmail
- [04:57] and extracts URLs using regular
- [04:59] expressions. And even if you don't know
- [05:00] regular expressions or what they are,
- [05:02] you can just say, write me a simple
- [05:03] Python script to do X, right? Just
- [05:05] describe what you want. Claude just
- [05:08] released Sonet 4.5 and this model is
- [05:09] really really good. It will figure it
- [05:11] out. So as you can see Claude gave me a
- [05:12] simple script. So what you would do is
- [05:14] copy it. Boom. And just paste it inside
- [05:16] of the code block node to kind of clean
- [05:19] it up, right? That's because then we
- [05:20] have a if else note. This figures out if
- [05:23] there is a URL or not because not every
- [05:24] email that you receive is going to have
- [05:26] some link, right? Most emails probably
- [05:28] don't have any links. But if there is a
- [05:30] link, you want to make sure that we run
- [05:32] it through VUS total. So then here we
- [05:34] have a HTTP node which sends a simple
- [05:36] post request to the API of V total but
- [05:39] at the same time we also check URL scan.
- [05:42] So URL scan is a similar service where
- [05:44] it checks the contents of the URL for
- [05:46] any malicious files or redirects or
- [05:49] stuff like that. Right? So even if half
- [05:51] of this automation fails, you still get
- [05:53] protected. So we hit both of these at
- [05:55] the same time. Now URL scan is a bit um
- [05:57] flaky sometimes it fails. So that's why
- [05:59] we have this error protection and it
- [06:01] also needs a 60-second delay, right? So
- [06:03] we have this weight node but then we get
- [06:05] the reports from both of these and we
- [06:06] merge them using this node combine and
- [06:09] then we clean the data once again. This
- [06:11] time we use JavaScript. It doesn't
- [06:13] really matter to be honest like you can
- [06:14] just py for JavaScript. Again I got chbd
- [06:17] or claw to write this super simple. And
- [06:19] the reason we need to clean that up is
- [06:20] because here we have the AI agent. This
- [06:22] is the brain of the whole automation. So
- [06:24] let's look at how the AI agent works.
- [06:26] Right? So first of all it has AI model.
- [06:27] We're using GPD 4 mini. This is the
- [06:30] go-to uh cheap model for AI agents.
- [06:33] Honestly, if you want a really powerful
- [06:35] model, right now the set just released,
- [06:37] so enthropic, you can change that and
- [06:39] you can instead use enthropic models
- [06:40] with the new cloth 4.5 set, which by the
- [06:42] way, if you want me to make a video on
- [06:44] that, make sure to subscribe and comment
- [06:46] below. Sonet 4.5 and I'll make a video
- [06:48] because this model is insane. Anyways,
- [06:50] for cost effective reasons, GBD4 mini is
- [06:53] a great choice. So, let's look at the
- [06:55] system prompt because this is what
- [06:56] matters. To be honest, this system
- [06:58] probably is a bit advanced, so feel free
- [06:59] to pause and take it. But basically,
- [07:01] what we do is we pass it all of the
- [07:03] results from V total, from URL scan. We
- [07:05] give it the raw URL, we give it the raw
- [07:07] email data and anything else the AI
- [07:09] agent might need to make a decision on
- [07:11] whether this is a safe email, whether
- [07:13] it's, you know, on the edge or whether
- [07:15] it is malicious. And this really is the
- [07:17] power of AI agents because normally you
- [07:19] would have to do, you know, some
- [07:20] parsing, some regular expressions to
- [07:22] figure out if there's some like keywords
- [07:23] or some blacklist. But the AI agent can
- [07:26] make the decision for you, right? He can
- [07:27] take the inputs and figure out is this a
- [07:30] suspicious email? Is this catchy? And if
- [07:32] so, it uses this tool that send you a
- [07:34] Gmail message. Now, if you want
- [07:36] something else, you can do Telegram. It
- [07:38] can DM you on Telegram. You can do
- [07:39] Discord. You can do WhatsApp. However
- [07:42] you want AI agent to contact you. Now,
- [07:43] this N10 automation is already very
- [07:46] useful, but if you think this is
- [07:48] impressive, just wait until you see the
- [07:50] other two AI agents. Oh, and by the way,
- [07:52] as I promised, here's what it looks like
- [07:53] when the AI agent sends you the email.
- [07:56] As you can see, this one was marked as
- [07:57] safe. Now, the biggest problem with AI
- [07:59] agents is that they are only useful if
- [08:02] they actually run 24/7. Because if you
- [08:04] build an AI agent and it never runs,
- [08:06] it's pointless. Now, the easiest way to
- [08:08] make your AI agents run 24/7 is by
- [08:11] hosting your own virtual private server.
- [08:14] And believe it or not, this is much
- [08:15] simpler than you think. The easiest way
- [08:17] to do this is with Hostinger, which is
- [08:19] what I use for all of my AI agents. And
- [08:21] the reason is they have optimized their
- [08:23] VPS for NA10. Plus, the setup is super
- [08:27] simple. Let me show you. So, first off,
- [08:29] to visit the Hostinger site, click the
- [08:31] link below the video and then click on
- [08:32] choose your plan. Now, Hostinger offers
- [08:34] many different VPS plans, but I think
- [08:37] the KVN2 one is perfect for most of you,
- [08:40] and it's also the one me and my team use
- [08:42] internally. So, click on choose plan,
- [08:44] and this will redirect you to the
- [08:45] checkout. here. Select the period. I
- [08:47] recommend going 24 months because when
- [08:49] you build your agents, you want them to
- [08:50] be running forever. Plus, you get a
- [08:52] really, really solid deal when you go
- [08:54] with the 24-month plan. You even get a
- [08:56] free domain for a year as a bonus. And
- [08:58] since Hostinger was kind enough to
- [09:00] sponsor this video, if you click on have
- [09:02] coupon code and type in David, you will
- [09:04] get another 10% off of your plan. Next,
- [09:07] we need to select the location of our
- [09:09] server. So, just select whatever is the
- [09:11] closest to you. I'm going to go with
- [09:12] France. And then we need to select the
- [09:14] operating system. Now, since we're
- [09:16] building AI agents in NA10, obviously
- [09:18] we're going to select NA10 right here.
- [09:20] And then what remains is finishing the
- [09:21] checkout. So, click on continue. Next,
- [09:23] we need to create an account. And this
- [09:24] takes 20 seconds. Super simple. Now,
- [09:26] after you sign up, you get redirected to
- [09:28] the billing page where you fill out your
- [09:30] name and your billing details and
- [09:32] complete the purchase of your VPS. And
- [09:34] once you complete the purchase, you will
- [09:35] find your VPS server right here in your
- [09:37] hosting panel. And you can see it's
- [09:39] already running. So, click on manage.
- [09:41] And here you can see all the details
- [09:42] about your virtual private server, CPU
- [09:44] usage, memory, outgoing traffic. This is
- [09:46] literally enough to run hundreds of AI
- [09:48] agents. But what we need to do is we
- [09:49] need to click on manage app. And this
- [09:51] will bring you to your NA10 server when
- [09:53] you can manage all of your AI agents. So
- [09:55] if you're serious about building AI
- [09:56] agents, make sure to check out
- [09:57] Hostinger. Use the link below the video.
- [09:59] It really is the simplest way to host
- [10:01] your AI agents. Now, the third lesson in
- [10:04] cyber security is using multiple emails.
- [10:07] A lot of people have a single email for
- [10:09] everything and this is terrible. What
- [10:11] you need to do is you need to separate
- [10:13] your sensitive accounts like your
- [10:15] banking, your finance, your login from
- [10:17] the email you use for public
- [10:19] communication. For example, you could
- [10:21] have email for applying for jobs,
- [10:23] sending code emails, email for banking
- [10:25] apps, sensitive work, and so on. Now,
- [10:28] this is already a pretty advanced setup,
- [10:30] but just having two different email
- [10:32] addresses, right? one for all the public
- [10:34] facing stuff that other people have and
- [10:36] another that's like a series of random
- [10:38] characters that only you know that
- [10:40] already hits the 80 to 20. The next
- [10:42] lesson is updating your software. Now
- [10:45] most conspiracy theories turn out to be
- [10:46] true. But one that is not true is that
- [10:49] companies are scheming to slow your
- [10:51] software down and that you shouldn't
- [10:52] upgrade. This is very dumb because most
- [10:55] software upgrades also include some
- [10:57] security fixes. So when there is an
- [10:59] actual breach or some hack, software
- [11:01] companies work day and night to fix it
- [11:03] as soon as possible. And by having the
- [11:05] latest update, you protect yourself
- [11:07] against most of the known exploits. But
- [11:09] if all of your software is running old
- [11:11] versions, you are exposing yourself to
- [11:13] unnecessary risk. And the solution can
- [11:15] be as simple as enabling auto update on
- [11:18] most of your sensitive apps. The next
- [11:20] essential cyber security tip you need to
- [11:22] know is email breach alerts. Now, what
- [11:24] even are email breach alerts? They're
- [11:27] automatic warnings when something
- [11:29] sketchy happens with your email. Now,
- [11:31] basically, every month there is a
- [11:32] massive email breach of millions of
- [11:34] accounts and you won't be notified when
- [11:37] your email is included in these
- [11:39] breaches. Now, of course, there are many
- [11:40] issues if someone gains access to your
- [11:42] email as a result of your email being
- [11:44] included in a breach, right? They can
- [11:46] access your banking information. They
- [11:47] can change your passwords. They can
- [11:49] email people on your behalf. It is a
- [11:51] mess. And this can be much harder to
- [11:52] detect because what if the attackers set
- [11:54] up auto forwarding rules that you don't
- [11:57] notice on your email? It might take you
- [11:59] weeks or months before you notice. Now,
- [12:01] luckily, there's a way to prevent it and
- [12:03] that's by building an AI agent that
- [12:05] monitors your main emails to see if they
- [12:08] have been included in one of the recent
- [12:09] breaches. And to do that, we're going to
- [12:11] use the famous website, have I been
- [12:13] pawned? This is a popular breach
- [12:15] notification service that will notify
- [12:17] you if your email has been compromised.
- [12:19] Now, if you think, David, you know, I
- [12:21] keep my email safe. I I have multiple
- [12:23] passwords. My password is strong, right?
- [12:25] There's 15 billion accounts that have
- [12:28] been compromised. So, check your emails.
- [12:30] You'll be surprised. Now, what happens
- [12:32] when you underestimate this threat is
- [12:33] that you can lose a lot of money. And
- [12:35] this happens even to big companies.
- [12:37] There was a Canadian university that
- [12:39] lost $10 million. The part supplier to
- [12:41] Toyota lost 37 million through a simple
- [12:44] email scam. Now, luckily, you can
- [12:46] prevent this with this simple AI agent.
- [12:48] So, as you can see, there's a lot less
- [12:51] modules or nodes here than the first
- [12:53] one, but it's even more powerful. So, we
- [12:56] have a schedule trigger. This runs every
- [12:58] single day at 9:00 a.m. You can change
- [13:00] this to run once a week if you want, but
- [13:02] I think daily is good. And then it gets
- [13:04] a list of your emails for Google Sheets,
- [13:06] right? So again I recommend you having
- [13:08] multiple emails minimum two minimum one
- [13:10] for secure stuff and one public facing
- [13:13] email but ideally you have a lot more
- [13:15] than two emails and you can keep them
- [13:17] securely in a single Google sheet which
- [13:19] then we check each of them through have
- [13:21] I been pawned. So again HTTP request to
- [13:24] the API of this website with your emails
- [13:27] being appended in a variable at the end
- [13:29] of the URL. This means that we are
- [13:31] regularly running all of your emails
- [13:33] through have I been pawned. Something
- [13:35] that most people never do or they do it
- [13:36] like once a year. If you set this up, it
- [13:39] checks it daily. So this is what I mean
- [13:41] that it's going to take your cyber
- [13:42] security to the next level. And again,
- [13:44] the report goes to an AI agent which can
- [13:46] decide whether something has been
- [13:48] compromised in which case it will decide
- [13:50] to notify you and if not all is good.
- [13:53] You can sleep well. But as you can see
- [13:54] it doesn't take a lot. This is like what
- [13:56] six nodes total and it's a very powerful
- [13:59] NA10 automation that you have to build
- [14:01] once and it works forever. This is the
- [14:04] beauty of AI agents. The next lesson is
- [14:07] kind of obvious but password sharing is
- [14:09] bad almost in all cases. Now it's one
- [14:12] thing sharing your Netflix with your
- [14:14] friends. It's another thing giving your
- [14:17] phone code to your wife to your
- [14:19] girlfriend. Those are much worse
- [14:21] practices, right? And it's not because
- [14:22] your girlfriend works for MSAD. It's
- [14:24] because the more people have access to
- [14:26] your accounts, the higher the attack
- [14:27] vector, right? All it takes is one
- [14:29] person to click a fishing link. And if
- [14:31] there's five people who can access your
- [14:33] email, it doesn't make your email five
- [14:35] times less secure. It's more like 25
- [14:37] times less secure. So even though it's
- [14:39] obvious, it doesn't hurt to remind
- [14:41] ourselves that the less password sharing
- [14:43] you do, the less likely it is that your
- [14:45] password gets leaked. The next lesson is
- [14:47] uninstalling apps. That's right. Even a
- [14:50] simple thing like this can reduce your
- [14:51] exposure to these exploits and breaches.
- [14:54] I mean, if there's an app on your phone
- [14:56] or your computer that you haven't used
- [14:58] for three plus months, just uninstall
- [15:00] it. Okay? There's no reason to have so
- [15:02] many apps. You also save storage, but
- [15:04] most importantly, you reduce the attack
- [15:06] surface of something being compromised,
- [15:08] right? If you have 100 pieces of
- [15:10] software on your machine, it's much more
- [15:13] likely that one of them has some exploit
- [15:15] than if you only have the 20 apps that
- [15:17] you actually use. So, just try to keep
- [15:19] your devices as clean as possible and
- [15:21] get into habit of uninstalling an app
- [15:24] for each new app that you install. Real
- [15:26] quick, if you're finding this video
- [15:27] valuable, please make sure to subscribe.
- [15:29] It takes 2 seconds, it's completely
- [15:31] free, and it tells me that you want to
- [15:33] see more videos like this one. Thank
- [15:34] you. Now, the next lesson is a bit more
- [15:36] advanced, and that is auditing your
- [15:38] websites, especially if you're a VIP
- [15:40] coder. Okay? So, if you used AI to build
- [15:42] any software in the last two years, pay
- [15:45] attention. Now again, I build an AI
- [15:47] agent that will do this for us, but it
- [15:50] is very likely that your website is
- [15:51] either not secure, it's leaking more
- [15:53] information, it has some authentication
- [15:54] oversight or some other security issue.
- [15:57] You don't want hackers or bad actors to
- [15:59] find that out. You want yourself to find
- [16:01] it out and to fix it. So I call this AI
- [16:04] agent the website security auditor. And
- [16:06] basically what it does is that it
- [16:08] regularly tries to pentest. Pentesting
- [16:10] means penetration testing, which means
- [16:12] checking your website for any
- [16:13] vulnerabilities. And this is especially
- [16:15] important if you are building a startup,
- [16:17] right? Because not only can they hack
- [16:19] your own accounts, they can get customer
- [16:22] data as well. And that really is the
- [16:23] worst case scenario. You know, just last
- [16:26] month there was the T app which got a
- [16:28] massive breach because it was sloppy and
- [16:30] it left an exposed Firebase bucket that
- [16:33] was publicly accessible to anyone with
- [16:36] that URL. Now, if that person had this
- [16:39] AI agent that I'm about to show you,
- [16:41] they probably wouldn't have ruined their
- [16:43] whole startup. So here is what the agent
- [16:45] looks like. The trigger is a landing
- [16:47] page URL, right? So obviously you're
- [16:48] going to put your own website or if
- [16:50] you're doing this for a client, maybe
- [16:51] you can put his website. So then we take
- [16:53] the URL and we scrape the contents of
- [16:55] the website which we route into two
- [16:57] different paths with two different AI
- [16:59] agents on each path. So on the top one
- [17:01] we have a code node which extracts the
- [17:03] headers and sends those into our
- [17:06] security AI agent. And this one just
- [17:07] does a very basic analysis of any
- [17:10] leaking metadata or issues with your
- [17:13] headers specifically. Now the agent at
- [17:15] the bottom is running a more powerful
- [17:17] model like GBD5. You can also change it
- [17:19] for you know sonet 4.5 to have one open
- [17:21] AI and one entropic to have even more
- [17:23] exposure. But basically these two agents
- [17:25] look at your website at the structure of
- [17:27] your landing page and your login page
- [17:29] and look for potential ways that a
- [17:30] hacker might attack your website. Now to
- [17:32] be perfectly clear, if someone is a
- [17:35] professional hacker and wants to hack
- [17:36] you, you probably stand no chance,
- [17:38] right? Because those are genius
- [17:40] programmers. So the best thing is do not
- [17:42] piss off any hackers. But this is just
- [17:44] another protection that if you build a
- [17:46] VIP coded site, having this N10
- [17:48] automation run through it is going to
- [17:50] decrease the likelihood of you having
- [17:52] any obvious exploits on your landing
- [17:54] page. All right, so let's continue. We
- [17:56] have the merge node. Again, we merge the
- [17:58] outputs of these two agents into a
- [18:00] single result. We then aggregate the
- [18:02] results. We run them through two
- [18:03] different code nodes. This one is
- [18:05] processing and parsing and the second
- [18:07] one converts it to HTML. That way we can
- [18:09] then send it through an email. Again,
- [18:12] feel free to use something else. Slack,
- [18:14] Discord, Telegram, whatever you want to
- [18:16] be notified on, right? It doesn't have
- [18:18] to be Gmail. The reason I added Gmail is
- [18:20] because everybody has a Gmail, let's be
- [18:21] honest. So yeah, this AI agent pretty
- [18:23] simple even though it might look
- [18:25] intimidating, but if you've built a AI
- [18:28] coded website over the last 2 years,
- [18:29] please run it through an NAN automation
- [18:31] like this one so you don't have any
- [18:34] sloppy security issues. Next up, if you
- [18:37] don't already use a VPN, you probably
- [18:38] should, right? First of all, if you live
- [18:40] in the UK, the government just wants to
- [18:41] track you completely, so you need a VPN
- [18:44] just for that. Second of all, if you're
- [18:46] using, you know, like airport Wi-Fi or
- [18:48] McDonald's Wi-Fi, having another layer
- [18:50] of security never hurts. So, what a VPN
- [18:53] does is that it hides your IP address
- [18:55] from the sites and the apps that you
- [18:56] use, which makes it harder for attackers
- [18:58] or governments to track where you are,
- [19:01] where you're coming from, stuff like
- [19:03] that. Now, a pro tip when it comes to
- [19:05] VPNs, just please check who owns the
- [19:08] company of your VPN because let's just
- [19:10] say a lot of these VPN companies are
- [19:12] owned by people like the Versell CEO and
- [19:14] his friends. If you know, you know.
- [19:16] Anyways, the last bonus tip is something
- [19:19] that even Zach himself, which is a, you
- [19:22] know, professional programmer and a
- [19:23] multi-billionaire uses, and that is
- [19:26] taping your ports. Right? So if you work
- [19:28] in an office especially, a lot of
- [19:30] monitors, a lot of displays have like
- [19:32] USB ports behind them. You can go to the
- [19:34] next level and do that even for a
- [19:35] laptop, right? And the reason why you
- [19:37] should do this is that you never know if
- [19:38] someone inserts like a USB stick into
- [19:41] like a hidden port in your PC in the
- [19:44] back. It can take you months if not
- [19:46] years to notice. Another thing is having
- [19:48] this camera cover, right? This is
- [19:50] something you can buy on Amazon for like
- [19:51] $2 or $3, and it's a great thing to have
- [19:54] for extra peace of mind. It allows you
- [19:56] to still have your camera on your
- [19:58] laptop. So, it's much better than just
- [19:59] taping it. But if you aren't on a video
- [20:02] call, just slide it over and it's
- [20:03] covered. And obviously, physical
- [20:05] protection is better than just hoping
- [20:07] the software is good. So, those were 10
- [20:09] cyber security fundamentals. Again,
- [20:11] thank you Hostinger for sponsoring this
- [20:12] video. If you use NA10, which you
- [20:14] absolutely should, make sure to switch
- [20:16] over to Hostinger. It's the most
- [20:17] affordable solution. It's super easy to
- [20:20] set up and with a single VPS, especially
- [20:23] if you go with the KVM2 plan, you can
- [20:25] run like thousands of AI agents without
- [20:27] hitting any limits. There's no limits on
- [20:29] workflows, no limits on executions. You
- [20:31] have your own VPS. You can see all the
- [20:33] stats. This is why I use Hostinger for
- [20:35] all of my AI agents, and this is why you
- [20:37] should use Hostinger as well. So again,
- [20:39] use my link below the video and use the
- [20:41] code David for another 10% off. With
- [20:43] that being said, thank you guys for
- [20:44] watching and have a nice rest of your
- [20:46] day. See you.
