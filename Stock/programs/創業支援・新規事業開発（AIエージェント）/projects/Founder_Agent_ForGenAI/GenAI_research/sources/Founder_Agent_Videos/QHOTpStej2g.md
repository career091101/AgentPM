- [00:00] OpenAI just released another big thing.
- [00:02] They have their own browser now and it's
- [00:04] making real waves all across the
- [00:05] internet. And I really wanted to make
- [00:07] this video to talk about if this is any
- [00:09] good and worth your attention. How this
- [00:11] compares to some of the competition out
- [00:12] there cuz this product doesn't exist in
- [00:14] a vacuum because consumers have many
- [00:16] choices these days. And three, how
- [00:18] capable is it actually? So let's start
- [00:21] that discussion by summarizing what this
- [00:23] actually is. It's called Chachib Atlas,
- [00:25] a brand new browser that is as of now
- [00:27] available on Mac OS for all plans. Yes,
- [00:30] that includes the free plan and there's
- [00:32] no geographic restrictions here. So even
- [00:34] people sitting in Europe like me can try
- [00:36] this out right now. If you're on a Mac,
- [00:38] simply download this, install this,
- [00:39] login with your Chat GPT account, and
- [00:41] off you go. This is what it looks like.
- [00:42] It's basically a browser that has Chat
- [00:44] GPT as the default new tab window with a
- [00:47] few things that should be noted. and it
- [00:49] brings some unique features compared to
- [00:50] just using chatb in a tab as everybody
- [00:53] has been so far. First of all, and kind
- [00:54] of obviously if you're on any website,
- [00:56] you can just click ask chat here and you
- [00:59] have it right there and it has the
- [01:00] context of the entire site loaded into
- [01:03] the chat. No need to copy paste. You can
- [01:04] kind of just talk to it. And at this
- [01:06] point, I want to start pointing out how
- [01:07] this compares to some of the competition
- [01:08] cuz this is not a brand new idea. These
- [01:10] Chrome extensions that do this have been
- [01:12] around well since the advent of chat in
- [01:14] 2022. It's a useful thing, but honestly,
- [01:17] copying something and moving it to a new
- [01:19] tab isn't that big of a pain point. So,
- [01:22] call this one a nice to have. Secondly,
- [01:24] and more interesting, so they have this
- [01:25] concept of browser memories. So, if I go
- [01:28] here to my settings and I go to
- [01:30] personalization, you will see a new
- [01:32] category here where it says reference
- [01:34] browser memories. If you're familiar
- [01:35] with chatdy memories, this is the same
- [01:37] idea, but from your browsing experience.
- [01:39] So, as it learns about your internet
- [01:41] usage, it adds them here. This is a
- [01:44] thing I don't dare to express an opinion
- [01:45] on yet cuz time will show how this is
- [01:48] actually implemented. And this is a very
- [01:49] unique feature that I believe we haven't
- [01:50] seen from any other product yet, but at
- [01:52] the end of the day, it's just another
- [01:53] way to automatically gather context and
- [01:55] save it to your account. Beyond that, I
- [01:57] should point out when you install this,
- [01:59] it asks you to import all of your
- [02:01] bookmarks and your history from Google
- [02:04] Chrome. And this kind of launches me
- [02:05] into the biggest question and concern
- [02:07] here, which is, okay, so you install
- [02:09] this and then you decide to give all of
- [02:10] your browser history and all of your
- [02:12] bookmarks to OpenAI just by importing
- [02:15] it. Hm. Sure, that can be useful in some
- [02:17] of the things, but just be aware that
- [02:18] that's what you're doing when you're
- [02:20] installing this, importing everything
- [02:21] over. And yes, it will open up some nice
- [02:23] opportunities, but you might not want to
- [02:25] share your entire browser history with
- [02:26] OpenAI. And this is kind of a sneaky way
- [02:28] of them getting it. So, just be aware of
- [02:30] that. What I could do now is something
- [02:32] like I did in a previous chat here and
- [02:34] ask something like find movies and shows
- [02:35] I recently viewed. Scan my recent
- [02:37] browsing and surface movies and shows I
- [02:39] viewed or searched for recently and then
- [02:41] use my browser history as context to
- [02:44] correctly identify that yeah I checked
- [02:45] out trailers for the bear pantheon the
- [02:48] Gothic one remake game trailer. That's a
- [02:51] good one. And then make suggestions for
- [02:52] what I should view next which actually
- [02:54] I've seen half of these. So this is
- [02:56] quite good yet again none of this is
- [02:58] really novel. We've seen this from other
- [02:59] AI browsers and from Google themselves
- [03:01] where you could use your Google Chrome
- [03:03] history as context in the chat. And you
- [03:06] might see the theme here already. It's
- [03:07] sort of pulling these various things
- [03:08] together. And that brings me to the next
- [03:10] big point which is the agent mode in
- [03:12] here. And this is the one where we'll
- [03:14] start getting practical. And I want to
- [03:15] actually start by running a rather
- [03:18] complicated prompt for the agent mode to
- [03:20] execute. It's going to be one that
- [03:21] includes three different applications.
- [03:23] Before I run this, I just want to
- [03:25] quickly intro agent mode. It's basically
- [03:26] their version of what would be called a
- [03:28] computer use agent, an AI that has
- [03:31] access to a computer, to a browser, and
- [03:32] then it does things, clicks buttons,
- [03:34] gets things done. Usually, they take the
- [03:36] same demo of like booking travel, which
- [03:38] is not a real painoint people have. I
- [03:39] don't understand why they always use
- [03:41] that as a demo, but that's what this is.
- [03:43] It's basically agent mode that you
- [03:44] already had in chat just within here.
- [03:47] Now, it has all of the context, the
- [03:48] history, maybe even the passwords that
- [03:50] you have in your browser if you store
- [03:52] them in there, which is just a more
- [03:53] user-friendly way to use this. But
- [03:55] basically, it's the same agent mode.
- [03:56] It's a very interesting app. But here's
- [03:57] a quick word from the sponsor of today's
- [03:59] video. Okay, so one of the things I
- [04:00] noticed with the new video generation
- [04:02] models is that while they're amazing,
- [04:04] most people don't actually want the new
- [04:06] video generation model, they want one
- [04:08] platform that can do it all rather than
- [04:10] jumping back and forth between different
- [04:12] tabs to make their vision come to life.
- [04:14] And that's why I want to show you LTX
- [04:15] Studio, the sponsor of today's video. So
- [04:17] LTX Studio is a AI powered studio built
- [04:20] for filmmakers, advertisers, and
- [04:22] creative teams. It gives you access to
- [04:24] cutting edge video and image generation
- [04:27] models, but also everything else you
- [04:28] need to take a project from concept to
- [04:30] final cut all in one place. You can
- [04:32] start with just a script, a concept, an
- [04:34] image, or even a video. And LTX gives
- [04:36] you professionalgrade tools to shape it
- [04:38] however you want. You can generate
- [04:40] production ready visuals, direct every
- [04:42] shot with camera movement controls and
- [04:44] key frames. It even gives you the
- [04:45] possibility to guide the look with
- [04:47] preset visual styles so your work stays
- [04:49] consistent. There's also a feature
- [04:50] called AI casting, which lets you create
- [04:52] and reuse characters across scenes with
- [04:55] custom wardrobes, so you don't lose
- [04:57] continuity. And when your project is
- [04:59] progressing and the time to polish it
- [05:01] comes around, you've got built-in tools
- [05:02] like dynamic storyboards, a timeline
- [05:05] editor, and even sound design. Again,
- [05:07] all in one place. They also just
- [05:09] launched a voiceover function, which is
- [05:10] powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
- [05:13] lets you use 30 professionally designed
- [05:14] voices. Plus, if you're working with a
- [05:16] team, all of this is collaborative. You
- [05:18] can share projects, manage assets, and
- [05:20] give feedback all inside the same
- [05:22] workspace. So, if you want a platform
- [05:24] that brings the power of AI video models
- [05:26] together with the control and
- [05:28] collaboration tools you actually need,
- [05:30] check out LTX Studio. You can start
- [05:32] exploring it today by using the link at
- [05:33] the top of the video's description. A
- [05:35] big thank you to LTX Studio for
- [05:37] sponsoring this video. So, let's see if
- [05:38] this works any better in this desktop
- [05:41] version by trying out this test prompt.
- [05:43] We're in step one, we're going to be
- [05:45] reading in context from this document. I
- [05:46] just copied a guide from our community
- [05:48] over. This will be the context. The
- [05:50] content here doesn't really matter. I
- [05:51] just wanted to read it from that Google
- [05:53] doc. Then I want to write an email with
- [05:55] a summary of what the document includes
- [05:57] that will be using my Gmail account that
- [05:59] I'm logged into here. And then thirdly,
- [06:01] I want to track all the emails that have
- [06:03] been sent in this spreadsheet that is
- [06:05] open over here. It's completely empty.
- [06:07] And at this point, I'll just make sure
- [06:08] agent mode is enabled and that I'm
- [06:10] actually logged in with all the accounts
- [06:12] that I have. Otherwise, these things
- [06:14] wouldn't work. Okay, send this. And now
- [06:15] let me tell you how this actually worked
- [06:17] in the main competitor to this product
- [06:19] which is Claude's Chrome extension. If
- [06:22] we just briefly pull up my other
- [06:23] browser, it's right here installed. And
- [06:25] I actually keep using this thing ever
- [06:27] since its release. And it's so damn
- [06:29] good. It's better than all the
- [06:30] competition. I know the top comment on
- [06:32] the video when I made a video on that
- [06:33] Chrome extension was, "Hey, what about
- [06:35] comment?" Well, comet is good. It's the
- [06:37] same concept as Atlas here, right? But
- [06:39] it just doesn't work as reliably. And
- [06:40] that's a big word in this discussion
- [06:42] here. Reliability. Is this thing
- [06:44] reliable? Because of course the idea of
- [06:46] an agent that just controls your browser
- [06:48] and does the work for you is great. But
- [06:50] if you run a task 10 times and three
- [06:51] times out of that it does something
- [06:53] completely random, you're not going to
- [06:54] end up using it cuz it's going to cause
- [06:56] more work than it actually removes. And
- [06:59] that brings me to the last part of this
- [07:00] video, which is the various examples
- [07:02] that I tested in here and how they
- [07:03] contrast to some of the competing
- [07:05] products as of the features. And I
- [07:06] pointed out to you what it does and what
- [07:09] competing products exist that do this
- [07:10] already. Sure, this ties it all into one
- [07:12] package, which is kind of nice. But then
- [07:14] at the end of the day, if I want to get
- [07:16] something done like the task we just
- [07:17] launched, it's a real question if I
- [07:19] should be using this cloud's browser
- [07:20] extension, which has the same agentic
- [07:22] capabilities, or something like Google's
- [07:24] computer use model that they just
- [07:26] released two weeks ago that has beat all
- [07:28] the benchmarks. And let me just tell you
- [07:29] on these agentic tasks, I find claude to
- [07:32] be straight up better. And I don't think
- [07:33] that's because the extension has some
- [07:35] genius architecture running in the
- [07:36] background or that chatbt atlas is just
- [07:39] not good enough. I think it's because of
- [07:41] the model. Brief reminder that OpenAI
- [07:43] did not ship a new model here. They
- [07:44] shipped a new interface that contains
- [07:46] and uses the model they already had. And
- [07:48] I'm really curious to see how this task
- [07:50] actually performs because in the case of
- [07:53] Claude that uses the Sonnet 4.5 model
- [07:56] where one of the big headline benchmarks
- [07:58] and announcement was that it's so much
- [07:59] better at computer use. It was so smart
- [08:02] at doing this. If you saw that original
- [08:04] video, you might remember that it
- [08:05] actually did this task. It sent the
- [08:07] email and at this step right here where
- [08:09] I'm at right now, by the way, the
- [08:10] computer is doing this, not me, right?
- [08:12] It put in the summary of the email. It
- [08:14] put in all the data correctly, but it
- [08:16] was lacking a header. And then it
- [08:19] actually went back and saw that there's
- [08:21] no header and it deleted it, added the
- [08:23] head header, and then moved everything
- [08:24] down. Here in this case, it seemed to
- [08:26] have got this right on the first try.
- [08:29] So, that is nice. And that's actually
- [08:30] it. It just finished up the task. So,
- [08:32] let's see. It created the draft of the
- [08:34] email. It's right here. And it saved the
- [08:35] data that I asked for in here. And I
- [08:37] remember this prompt actually just asks
- [08:39] for the date and the email and not the
- [08:40] content of the email. So it did what I
- [08:42] told it correctly. But if it does this,
- [08:44] it could easily also add the content
- [08:46] over here that it wrote here. So on this
- [08:48] task, it did equally as well as clot.
- [08:50] Nice. Let me give you a few more
- [08:52] examples that I ran before making this
- [08:54] video on which it wasn't equal. And that
- [08:56] should give you enough of a feeling for
- [08:57] how this works. And that should round
- [08:58] out the video and give you enough
- [08:59] information to make a decision for
- [09:00] yourself if you want to give this a shot
- [09:02] yourself on your own machine. So, first
- [09:04] of all, I just gave it a picture of
- [09:05] Conor McGregor that was randomly on my
- [09:07] desktop. I think for AI news you can
- [09:09] use. I was doing some AI remix of it or
- [09:11] whatever. And I asked it to generate a
- [09:12] 100 social media captions using Claude
- [09:14] AI for this image and put them into this
- [09:17] Google sheet. So, what I found is that
- [09:19] it actually did that, but it didn't use
- [09:21] Claude in the process. So, it just
- [09:23] opened up the sheet and it successfully
- [09:24] put them in here. And look at these
- [09:26] captions. They always like repeat four
- [09:28] times, three times, just emojis or the
- [09:29] hashtag varies. And it's good. You know,
- [09:31] they're solid captions. Then I followed
- [09:33] up and said, "Do 100 more by using
- [09:34] Claude AI." And then I provided the URL.
- [09:36] And this would be my tip. If you're
- [09:37] using this, give it the URLs and then it
- [09:39] will reliably use the tools. What it did
- [09:41] then is it opened up Claude, which I was
- [09:43] logged into. It wrote this prompt right
- [09:45] here, which I thought it was funny that
- [09:47] it mentioned avoid mentioning the
- [09:48] fighter's name. That's obviously the
- [09:50] chat GP restrictions at work here. And
- [09:52] then it just wrote 100 captions here.
- [09:54] The formatting is a bit off. Doesn't
- [09:55] really matter. It copied all over that.
- [09:57] made one mistake where it just kind of
- [09:58] copy pasted everything into one field,
- [10:00] but then sort of it corrected itself and
- [10:02] split them apart and there you go,
- [10:04] another 100 captions from Claude. Quick
- [10:06] note that I cannot withhold. I mean,
- [10:08] look at how much more variety you get in
- [10:09] the Claude captions. This is why Claude
- [10:11] is so damn good for writing and why
- [10:13] people really prefer it in many cases.
- [10:14] You just see that right here. But we're
- [10:16] judging chat GPT agent in chat GPT Atlas
- [10:19] right here. It did this super well. So
- [10:21] you can automate the usage of various
- [10:23] AIs and the manipulation of data with
- [10:25] spreadsheets, which I think is one of
- [10:27] the main things you will want to do with
- [10:29] tools like these, these computer use
- [10:30] agents. It's like using AIS, researching
- [10:33] stuff and manipulating spreadsheets, and
- [10:35] that's what it's really good at. This
- [10:37] worked well, but my tip would be be very
- [10:39] specific with the URLs of the tools and
- [10:41] something like the Claude Chrome
- [10:42] extension. It just pulled this up
- [10:44] without the URL here. It needs it. Not a
- [10:46] big deal. Then I did one more and this
- [10:47] is a tricky one. We had our quarterly
- [10:49] town hall in the community yesterday and
- [10:50] at the end of it we just got together
- [10:52] and tried this all together and we had
- [10:54] multiple AI educators and university
- [10:56] professors in the room and they brought
- [10:57] up one topic and that is that these
- [10:59] tools basically render things like
- [11:01] LinkedIn learning certifications useless
- [11:03] because the agent can just go through
- [11:05] it, take all the quizzes, watch all the
- [11:07] videos, pretend like somebody's taking
- [11:08] the course and just farm certifications
- [11:10] for you. So we put this to the test. We
- [11:12] actually made it take one of the quizzes
- [11:14] in our community concretely the final
- [11:16] quiz on the advanced LLM prompting
- [11:18] course and the results were very
- [11:20] interesting because I gave the same
- [11:21] question to both the claude chrome
- [11:23] extension and to chatpt atlas here and I
- [11:26] told it complete this quiz think
- [11:27] thoroughly I really need 100% at all
- [11:30] cost and here's what happened chatbt
- [11:33] took about 30 minutes and it still
- [11:35] wasn't done its method of getting all
- [11:37] the questions was basically scrolling
- [11:40] through all of this multiple times
- [11:42] compiling the screenshots and then very
- [11:44] slowly answering these questions. Claude
- [11:46] did the same, but it must have been like
- [11:48] 10 or 15 times faster than Chat GBT here
- [11:51] at doing it. And both of them got 95%.
- [11:54] And at this point, I have to actually
- [11:55] admit my fault. I'm taking full
- [11:57] responsibility for this. There was a
- [11:58] mistake in one of the quizzes and that's
- [12:00] the one question both of them got wrong.
- [12:03] This question that is taught in the
- [12:04] course, both AIs actually answered
- [12:06] correctly, but we in our system had a
- [12:08] wrong answer selected. So, long story
- [12:10] short, basically both of the systems got
- [12:13] a perfect 23 out of 23, but there was a
- [12:15] mistake on our sides, which really
- [12:17] tripped GT5 up. Kept running in loops
- [12:19] after it was done and just couldn't
- [12:21] finish the task because I asked for 100%
- [12:23] and Claude was just like, "Hey, I did it
- [12:25] and this seems right to me." But even
- [12:26] without those loops, Claude was around
- [12:28] 10 times faster at actually completing
- [12:30] the quiz the first time. So, yeah, that
- [12:32] should make you think about all types of
- [12:33] certifications that people show off on
- [12:35] their LinkedIn. All you need is a free
- [12:36] chat account in the Atlas to kind of do
- [12:38] that. and it's a real mess for
- [12:40] e-learning. So overall, what's the
- [12:41] verdict here? Well, it's just OpenAI's
- [12:43] version of something that we already
- [12:45] had. If I had to pick one winner, which
- [12:47] one of these computer use agents works
- [12:48] the best? Well, it would still be the
- [12:50] cloth browser extension with Sonnet 4.5.
- [12:53] That model is just the fastest and the
- [12:55] most reliable at all of these tasks that
- [12:57] I have tried so far. GBT5, this would be
- [12:59] a close second though, and maybe this
- [13:01] browser interface is actually preferable
- [13:03] to you. I know a lot of people used
- [13:04] Atlas before and really enjoyed that.
- [13:06] But I personally think that a lot of
- [13:07] these features like, you know,
- [13:09] summarizing a website with like one
- [13:11] click are a nice to have, but they're
- [13:13] rather niche. It's not something you're
- [13:14] going to be using on every site that
- [13:16] you're on. And honestly, even if I had
- [13:18] to copy this over to a new tab and
- [13:20] summarize it here, it's not big enough
- [13:22] of a pain point to change my personal
- [13:24] behavior and approach to browsers. And
- [13:26] above all, there's a real privacy
- [13:27] concern where you're sharing all of your
- [13:29] browsing data with OpenAI if you use
- [13:31] this and even if you import your Chrome
- [13:33] profile. So think about that before you
- [13:35] try this. And lastly, I want to point
- [13:36] out that this is just OpenAI's version
- [13:38] of the open-source Chromium, which
- [13:40] Google Chrome is based on. So it's
- [13:42] nearly identical to Chrome, but it's set
- [13:44] up to be AI first with interesting
- [13:46] features that will evolve over time like
- [13:48] browser memories and also you can do
- [13:50] custom instructions for your agent mode
- [13:52] here. Although I personally cannot edit
- [13:54] these right now. So I think this is the
- [13:55] first version that for the curious is
- [13:57] worth exploring, but I expect this to
- [13:59] get a whole lot better and featurerich
- [14:01] over time. And I also expect them to do
- [14:03] particular models that are really good
- [14:05] at these type of tasks. Interesting
- [14:07] release, not a game changer. All right,
- [14:08] that's pretty much everything I have for
- [14:10] today. My name is Igor and I hope you
- [14:11] have a wonderful
