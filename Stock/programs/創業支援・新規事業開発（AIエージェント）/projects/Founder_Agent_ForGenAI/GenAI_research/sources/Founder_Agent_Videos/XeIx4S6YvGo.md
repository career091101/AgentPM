- [00:00] OpenAI just killed Naden. Or did they
- [00:02] really? Because they just dropped their
- [00:03] agent kit. We may be seeing that
- [00:04] narrative right now online. But today, I
- [00:07] am here to actually compare Agent Kit
- [00:09] and Naden and talk about the future of
- [00:10] both of these agent builders. As always,
- [00:13] we're not just going to be talking about
- [00:14] it. I'm going to be comparing both of
- [00:15] these platforms across different
- [00:16] categories so we can highlight each of
- [00:18] the platform strengths and weaknesses.
- [00:20] So, to start off with a quick overview
- [00:21] of each of these tools, we've got Agent
- [00:23] Kit, which just dropped October 6th of
- [00:25] 2025. It's OpenAI's agent builder that
- [00:27] looks like this. It's very very simple
- [00:29] to use and it's very drag and drop low
- [00:31] code visual interface. Here's a quote
- [00:33] from Sam Alman saying, "Agent Builder is
- [00:35] like Canva for building agents. It's a
- [00:37] fast visual way to design the logic,
- [00:39] steps, ideas." I'm assuming you guys
- [00:41] already know what Naden is, but if you
- [00:42] don't, it was released October 8th,
- [00:44] 2019, so about 6 years ago. But in the
- [00:46] last year, it really started to take
- [00:47] off. As you can see by this Google
- [00:48] Trends chart right here, Naden's in the
- [00:50] blue. And then we have other AI
- [00:52] automation platforms like Make and
- [00:54] Zapier down below. And you can see it
- [00:56] just hockey stickked right past them.
- [00:57] You can plug AI into your own data and
- [00:59] there's over 500 integrations which
- [01:01] makes it really easy to connect to your
- [01:02] tools and this is what NN looks like. So
- [01:05] like I said today we're going to be
- [01:06] comparing agent kit with NN across
- [01:08] different categories. To answer the
- [01:09] question is Agent Kit going to kill
- [01:11] NAND? And in short my answer is no. When
- [01:14] we started hearing rumors about this
- [01:15] dropping everyone immediately ran to
- [01:18] it's going to kill NAND? I don't think
- [01:19] it's going to at all. And I also want to
- [01:21] be really clear that I don't think
- [01:22] OpenAI's goal was to compete with NAND.
- [01:25] I think that Agent Kit is built for
- [01:27] teams and consumers that are really
- [01:29] integrated into OpenAI's environment and
- [01:31] they're not looking to build super super
- [01:33] custom robust AI automations and
- [01:35] autonomous systems. They're looking to
- [01:37] build some really quick and easy
- [01:38] workflows that's going to save
- [01:40] themselves time and maybe even some
- [01:41] conversational agents internally for
- [01:43] their team. Now, NN of course was built
- [01:45] to be completely everything. It's super
- [01:47] powerful. It was honestly built for
- [01:48] developers. It's a little bit more
- [01:49] technical, but because of that, you have
- [01:51] the ability to truly do anything. Like
- [01:53] when we saw Google drop their Opal,
- [01:55] which was like very similar visual
- [01:56] interface. People said, "Oh, is this
- [01:58] going to kill any?" No. Real quick, why
- [02:00] should you trust my opinion on this? I
- [02:01] run an AI automation community where I'm
- [02:03] teaching over 150,000 people how to
- [02:05] build AI solutions to implement into
- [02:07] businesses. And all of that is being
- [02:09] done with NAN. Our AI company, True
- [02:10] Horizon, consults and implements custom
- [02:12] AI solutions. And pretty much all of
- [02:14] that is NADN. And we've been working
- [02:16] with enterprise companies as well. So
- [02:17] the categories that we're going to look
- [02:18] at today are ease of use, triggers,
- [02:21] agent tools, model support, UI chat
- [02:23] components, and deployment and control.
- [02:25] So starting off with the first category,
- [02:27] we have ease of use. So if I'm like a
- [02:29] complete beginner and I want to test out
- [02:30] agent kit, which is OpenAI agent
- [02:32] builder, I would come here and I would
- [02:33] search OpenAI agent builder. I could
- [02:35] look at the release notes or I could go
- [02:37] here to the OpenAI platform, click on
- [02:39] agent builder, and then I could open up
- [02:40] my agent builder right here. This is
- [02:42] pretty much available to everyone. You
- [02:43] just have to have an OpenAI API account.
- [02:46] You can see here we have the ability to
- [02:48] create a workflow. And what's key here
- [02:49] in my mind is it says to build a chat
- [02:51] agent. Now a chat agent or a
- [02:53] conversational agent in my mind is very
- [02:55] different to like a fully autonomous
- [02:57] tools agent because the chat agent is
- [02:59] going to be looking up some information
- [03:00] for you, helping you get your questions
- [03:02] answered, but not as much like take
- [03:04] action on your behalf autonomously. So
- [03:06] anyways, we have some templates down
- [03:08] here that we could look at, but I'm just
- [03:09] going to go ahead and create a new flow
- [03:10] so we can get familiarized with this
- [03:12] environment. What you'll notice here is
- [03:13] that we have a start and I actually
- [03:15] cannot delete this start because every
- [03:17] workflow needs a trigger. You can see
- [03:18] that once you have this start, you have
- [03:20] to drag the circle to say where does
- [03:21] this go next just like end where you'd
- [03:23] connect your nodes together. And we have
- [03:25] an AI agent right here which we're able
- [03:26] to name. We're able to give it
- [03:28] instructions. We can include chat
- [03:29] history. We can choose the model, the
- [03:31] reasoning, we can give it tools. And we
- [03:33] have an output format section where we
- [03:35] can do text, JSON or widget, which we'll
- [03:37] talk a little bit about later. But what
- [03:38] I'm immediately seeing off the bat is
- [03:40] this whole interface is a lot less
- [03:42] intimidating than nitn. I can easily
- [03:44] choose my model, give it instructions,
- [03:46] and I can also on the lefthand side see
- [03:48] everything I have available to me, which
- [03:49] is an agent. I can end it. I can do a
- [03:52] file search. I can do guard rails, MCP
- [03:54] servers. I've only got five logic and
- [03:56] data operations to choose from. If,
- [03:58] else, while, human approval, transform,
- [04:01] or set state. And this is a lot less
- [04:03] intimidating to me as a complete
- [04:05] beginner with no coding background to
- [04:07] get into compared to when I jump into
- [04:09] something like niten create a new
- [04:10] workflow and then when I open up this
- [04:12] first step I have tons of different
- [04:14] things in here. Let's say I want to pull
- [04:15] in an AI agent and I can click on that
- [04:17] agent right here. I have this input
- [04:19] where I'm looking at this variable. I
- [04:20] have all these options down here to
- [04:22] choose from and I might not know exactly
- [04:23] what they mean. You can also see I have
- [04:25] an error already because I didn't
- [04:26] connect to chat model. I also have the
- [04:28] option to add memory and all these
- [04:29] different tools. And this just initially
- [04:31] is going to be a lot more intimidating
- [04:32] than hopping into the agent builder by
- [04:35] OpenAI. One of the first things that I
- [04:36] wanted to do when I built my first agent
- [04:38] ever is I wanted to connect it to the
- [04:39] internet so it could look up things for
- [04:40] me. And with OpenAI's agent builder, all
- [04:43] I have to do is click on this plus for
- [04:44] tool and I can just do web search. And
- [04:46] that's basically going to search the way
- [04:48] that you can do web search when you're
- [04:50] in chatbt. You can also specify to only
- [04:52] look through certain websites and you
- [04:53] can also do location-based searches. So
- [04:55] just like that, I already have an AI
- [04:57] agent that can search the web and I can
- [04:59] also connect a chat model right here
- [05:00] without ever having to go and get any
- [05:02] API key. But in any if we wanted to
- [05:04] search the web, we'd have to give it a
- [05:05] tool. We'd have to choose from all of
- [05:07] these hundreds of different tools. We
- [05:09] may even need to set up our own custom
- [05:10] HTTP request and we would also have to
- [05:13] go get an API key for both the web
- [05:15] search and also the chat model, which is
- [05:17] just a lot more intimidating and
- [05:18] definitely raises the barrier to entry a
- [05:20] little bit compared to the agent
- [05:21] builder. So if I was to think about the
- [05:23] time that it would take for a complete
- [05:24] beginner to build one automation system
- [05:26] in OpenAI agent builder or the exact
- [05:28] same system in Naden, they would do it
- [05:30] much quicker and feel a lot less
- [05:31] overwhelmed in agent builder hands down.
- [05:34] Which is why for this first category,
- [05:35] agent kit gets an 8 out of 10. Naden
- [05:37] gets a 6 out of 10 and that is our new
- [05:39] total for the scores right now. Anyways,
- [05:41] let's move on to the next category which
- [05:42] is triggers. So remember earlier when we
- [05:44] were looking at this workflow section
- [05:46] and it says to build a chat agent. Now
- [05:49] when we look at the triggers, you can
- [05:50] kind of see why I am drawn to that or
- [05:53] not drawn to that fixated on that
- [05:55] because when you have your AI agent and
- [05:56] you have just this start option, there's
- [05:58] no other triggers available as you can
- [06:00] see which means that if we want to
- [06:02] communicate with this agent, the only
- [06:03] way we can actually trigger it is by
- [06:05] talking to it as you can see over here
- [06:07] in this preview. So if I want to test my
- [06:08] workflow, I can chat with it right here
- [06:10] and I can say search the web for NDN. We
- [06:12] can see visually that the agent right
- [06:14] now is using its web search function and
- [06:16] it's using its reasoning to search the
- [06:17] web for Naden. And that's really cool
- [06:19] because we spun up a web agent in matter
- [06:21] of seconds. But the issue here is I
- [06:24] don't see a great way to have web- based
- [06:26] events or scheduled triggers. Even if we
- [06:28] go up here to publish our AI agent,
- [06:30] let's just say we're going to call this
- [06:31] test web agent or text, I guess. And
- [06:34] when we publish this, it said right
- [06:36] there that it could be used in API
- [06:37] calls. I don't know if you guys caught
- [06:39] that, but what we're able to do is
- [06:40] either embed it as chatkit, which I will
- [06:42] talk about a little bit later, or we
- [06:43] could trigger this agent from an agent's
- [06:45] SDK, and it gives us the TypeScript or
- [06:47] the Python. So, what this tells me is
- [06:49] you technically could be able to trigger
- [06:51] this agent from uh an HTTP request or
- [06:54] from like an action in an app, but it's
- [06:56] not super intuitive or easy. It would be
- [06:58] really nice if OpenAI had scheduled
- [07:00] triggers or app events, stuff like that.
- [07:03] For instance, if you wanted to make an
- [07:04] open AAI agent to respond to your
- [07:06] emails, it would not be as easy as an
- [07:08] NAN because there's not like a Gmail
- [07:10] trigger on new message received trigger.
- [07:13] Whereas an NAN and you want to look at
- [07:14] your triggers, we could go to Gmail
- [07:16] right here and then we could see our
- [07:18] trigger is on new message received. So
- [07:21] we could easily have this agent go off
- [07:23] whenever we get a new Gmail. We also
- [07:25] have eight triggers in Slack. So on any
- [07:27] event, on bot mentioned, on file shared,
- [07:29] on new user, on a reaction added,
- [07:31] there's so many triggers that are
- [07:32] already natively baked into Nitn. We we
- [07:35] could of course have a web hook. So our
- [07:36] CRM could send data, we could have
- [07:38] Google Drive, we could have Twilio, we
- [07:40] can have pretty much anything. And in my
- [07:42] mind, the systems that are most valuable
- [07:44] when it comes to automation or AI
- [07:45] automation are the ones that the human
- [07:47] doesn't have to manually trigger. So
- [07:49] real quick example, a lot of businesses
- [07:51] reach out to us and they want to
- [07:52] integrate this personal assistant that I
- [07:54] had built. However, when we're trying to
- [07:55] actually communicate what would be the
- [07:57] best quick win to show them ROI really
- [07:59] fast, I never would recommend a personal
- [08:01] assistant. What I would recommend is
- [08:02] something that nurtures leads or
- [08:03] responds to leads quicker and stuff like
- [08:05] that because those type of systems help
- [08:07] grow the business and as the business
- [08:08] grows, those systems will get used more
- [08:10] and more. So, the throughput of the
- [08:12] system increases as the business grows,
- [08:14] which is just a scalable compoundable
- [08:17] ROI of the system. And it's not the
- [08:19] exact same with something like a
- [08:20] personal assistant because as the
- [08:22] business grows, it doesn't necessarily
- [08:24] mean that you're going to be using the
- [08:25] system more. So, in a nutshell, the most
- [08:27] powerful automations in my mind are ones
- [08:29] that run in the background when you even
- [08:30] know they're running. And because in
- [08:32] OpenAI's agent builder, we're kind of
- [08:34] limited on our triggers and being able
- [08:36] to schedule or have things go off in the
- [08:38] background. That's why I think any
- [08:40] definitely takes the cake here, coming
- [08:41] in at a 10 out of 10 and agent kit comes
- [08:43] at a 5 out of 10, which makes our new
- [08:45] score agent kit 13 and 16. All right,
- [08:48] moving on to agent tools, which is
- [08:50] really, really important because this is
- [08:51] what gives our agents the ability to
- [08:52] actually do things on our behalf. So,
- [08:54] we're back in our OpenAI agent builder
- [08:56] flow where we already gave our agent the
- [08:58] tool of web search, which was super
- [08:59] easy. No API key, really quick. I love
- [09:02] it. But now, when we go to add more
- [09:03] tools, you can see we only have a few
- [09:05] options. We have a client tool, which is
- [09:07] the ability to send data back to our
- [09:09] chat kit widget, which I will say that
- [09:11] is very cool. We can do MCP servers. So,
- [09:13] this is nice because you can connect
- [09:14] really easily to Gmail, Google Calendar,
- [09:17] Drive, Outlook. You can see these other
- [09:18] integrations right here, but there
- [09:20] aren't a ton here and they all have to
- [09:21] be MCP servers. You also could connect
- [09:23] to a different MCP server, which is cool
- [09:25] because there's, you know, tons in
- [09:26] Zapier. You can even connect to your own
- [09:27] custom end workflow and there's also
- [09:29] lots of other MCP servers that you could
- [09:31] connect to. And it's not as powerful as
- [09:33] how many APIs there are out there and
- [09:35] how many you could connect to with a
- [09:36] standard HTTP request. And in Nitn when
- [09:38] you come in here to connect tools you
- [09:40] can first of all also call on an NIDN
- [09:42] workflow which is super powerful and
- [09:44] then of course you have all of these
- [09:45] native integrations which is just
- [09:46] there's literally hundreds and hundreds
- [09:48] I think it's over 500 native
- [09:49] integrations that they have. So almost
- [09:51] any tool that you could think of you can
- [09:52] connect to with your AI agents here. And
- [09:54] if Naden doesn't have a native
- [09:55] integration, you can use this HTTP
- [09:57] request tool which is the most dynamic
- [09:59] and powerful tool in the world because
- [10:01] you can literally talk to any service
- [10:03] that has API documentation. And like I
- [10:05] mentioned with being able to call on
- [10:07] subworkflows, you can see here with the
- [10:08] ultimate personal assistant, for
- [10:10] example, it has an email agent. And if I
- [10:12] open up this email agent workflow, what
- [10:14] we see is a completely separate AI agent
- [10:16] that I built in Naden. And this agent in
- [10:18] itself has tons of other tools that it
- [10:20] can use in here. So you can build some
- [10:22] really really powerful orchestration
- [10:24] agent systems in NN. And all of these
- [10:26] are super modular and reusable because
- [10:28] now if I ever need an email agent, I can
- [10:30] just hook it up to this one. Even if
- [10:32] this agent is hooked up to like 100, it
- [10:34] doesn't matter. And yes, I did say that
- [10:36] you can hook up an OpenAI agent to an NN
- [10:38] agent, which does work, but you would
- [10:40] need to use this, which is the MCP
- [10:42] server trigger right here. And you would
- [10:44] be able to hook up this MCP server to a
- [10:46] bunch of different tools. So, you do
- [10:47] have the ability to talk to some custom
- [10:48] agents and stuff in these workflows down
- [10:51] here. It's just not as powerful as the
- [10:53] sub workflow as a tool option. So, for
- [10:55] agent tools, agent kit's going to come
- [10:57] in once again at a five. N's going to
- [10:59] come in at a 10. And our new total is
- [11:01] agent kit 18. N 26. So, let's move into
- [11:04] the next category, which is model
- [11:06] support. So, this one's pretty simple
- [11:07] and it's pretty easy because in OpenAI,
- [11:10] of course, you only have access to the
- [11:11] OpenAI models. And that's really not a
- [11:13] huge problem. As you can see, we have
- [11:14] tons and tons of models. You've got
- [11:16] heavy ones, fast ones, reasoning ones.
- [11:18] It's really not that big of a deal. And
- [11:19] you also in here can change the
- [11:21] reasoning effort really quickly. You can
- [11:22] change the verbosity, the summary, the
- [11:24] tool choice, all of this kind of stuff.
- [11:26] And once again, because it's all baked
- [11:28] into your OpenAI environment, you
- [11:29] already have everything right here.
- [11:30] You're also able to easily toggle on or
- [11:32] off if you want chat history to be
- [11:34] included or not. But in NN, what you can
- [11:36] do is choose your own chat model. So,
- [11:37] Anthropic, Azure, Bedrock, Coher, any of
- [11:40] these. Or you could also just go to open
- [11:42] router. And now you can choose pretty
- [11:44] much any of the hundreds of models that
- [11:46] are on Open Router. So you have way more
- [11:48] freedom here. And honestly, I think that
- [11:50] is very important because I don't always
- [11:51] only just use OpenAI's models. I do a
- [11:54] lot of the times, but for certain use
- [11:56] cases, I really want to use a Google or
- [11:57] I really want to use anthropic. And when
- [11:59] you choose any of these models, you
- [12:01] still have the option to change things
- [12:02] like your top P, your frequency, your
- [12:04] sampling temperature, all that kind of
- [12:06] stuff as well in NAND, which is why
- [12:08] NIAND comes in at a 10 out of 10 because
- [12:10] you can also use local models because
- [12:12] you can host NAND locally. And agent
- [12:14] kit's going to come in at a 6 out of 10
- [12:16] here, pushing our new total to agent kit
- [12:18] 24 and N36. Now, this one's really
- [12:20] interesting. We are moving on to UI chat
- [12:23] components. So earlier in this video, I
- [12:25] alluded a few times to something called
- [12:26] Chatkit, which is like Agent Kit's
- [12:28] built-in tool to help you create like
- [12:30] website widgets and embed your OpenAI
- [12:33] agents really easily and really cleanly
- [12:35] onto your own website. Users can add
- [12:37] slick branded chat interfaces to their
- [12:39] apps without extra coding. Everything
- [12:40] looks polished and works with OpenAI
- [12:42] agents out of the box. And that is
- [12:43] actually a really big value ad for
- [12:45] OpenAI's agent kit. And it end on the
- [12:48] other hand focuses way more on the
- [12:49] backend workflows. So, it has no fancy
- [12:52] or easy way to embed chat interfaces by
- [12:54] default. You would typically need to
- [12:56] embed your agent into some sort of front
- [12:58] end if you want it to actually look
- [13:00] nice. Here's a quick example of all of
- [13:02] the different widgets you could create
- [13:03] and you could have your OpenAI agents
- [13:05] power these different widgets. And
- [13:07] that's where this output thing comes
- [13:08] into play. If I change this to widget,
- [13:10] we could basically set up the type of
- [13:12] widget we want and what little things
- [13:14] that our agents could change based on
- [13:15] its output in that widget. And so when I
- [13:17] click on create widget here, you can see
- [13:18] that we could either describe and start
- [13:20] to mock up what we want it to look like.
- [13:22] You can go to the gallery and see these
- [13:24] are types of widgets and this is what
- [13:25] you could have your agent actually
- [13:27] interface with and change. And so that's
- [13:28] why I think this is really cool for
- [13:30] their front end. But with Naden, you
- [13:32] have the option with the chat message
- [13:33] trigger to open up a chat interface and
- [13:36] embed it, but it just looks like this.
- [13:37] It's really hard to customize and it
- [13:39] just doesn't look great. So here's a
- [13:40] cool quote from HubSpot. Chatkit saved
- [13:42] us weeks of custom front-end work,
- [13:44] making it easy for us to prototype
- [13:46] enhancements to the UI of HubSpot's
- [13:47] breeze assistant and agents. With the
- [13:49] custom response widget, our agent can
- [13:50] deliver interactive guided solutions
- [13:52] instead of static replies. So, it is
- [13:54] very cool, which is why agent kit is
- [13:57] going to get a 9 out of 10 and Naden's
- [13:58] going to get a 5 out of 10, moving the
- [14:00] total to agent kit 33 and end 41.
- [14:02] Hopefully, I've done all this math
- [14:04] right. Let me know if I have not. And
- [14:05] now to talk about our final section, we
- [14:07] have deployment and control, which is
- [14:09] obviously a big deal, especially if you
- [14:11] want to do this for your own business or
- [14:13] help other businesses implement AI
- [14:15] automations. One of the biggest reasons
- [14:17] in my mind that blew up besides being
- [14:20] easy to use and visual is because it was
- [14:23] open- source. I think they prefer to
- [14:25] actually use the term code available or
- [14:27] something like that, but meaning you can
- [14:30] host it in the cloud, you can host it on
- [14:32] your own private server, you can host it
- [14:33] locally on your own computer, and you
- [14:34] can have full control over all of the
- [14:36] data, especially if you're locally
- [14:38] hosting your LLM as well. You know where
- [14:40] everything's going. Agent Kit, on the
- [14:42] other hand, is deployed and managed
- [14:43] entirely in OpenAI's cloud, so users
- [14:46] don't have to worry about the technical
- [14:47] setup, which is good. Everything's
- [14:48] hosted for them, but also OpenAI has
- [14:51] full control over where the data and
- [14:52] agents are living. And once again, if
- [14:54] your company and your workflows are
- [14:55] already completely baked into OpenAI's
- [14:57] environment, then that's probably not a
- [14:58] huge deal for you, and you could easily
- [15:00] spin up some really helpful automations
- [15:02] with OpenAI's Agent Kit. But Naden, once
- [15:04] again, you can have full control,
- [15:06] although sometimes that does require a
- [15:07] little bit more technical setup or
- [15:09] expertise at the beginning. So for
- [15:11] deployment and control, agent kit gets a
- [15:13] 7 out of 10. Naden gets a 10 out of 10,
- [15:15] moving the total to a final agent kit 40
- [15:18] and NADN 51, which means that NADN is
- [15:20] our winner today. But once again, this
- [15:22] is very relative. If I was approaching
- [15:24] this from a standpoint of a different
- [15:25] type of consumer, maybe not as much of a
- [15:27] developer standpoint, I would probably
- [15:29] enjoy Agent Kit more. So anyways,
- [15:31] there's a few more miscellaneous things
- [15:32] I wanted to hit on real quick about the
- [15:34] two platforms. So like pricing,
- [15:36] evaluation tools, and community support.
- [15:38] This is still not a finished product by
- [15:39] Agent Kit, and they're capable of doing
- [15:40] a ton of cool stuff here. So their
- [15:42] pricing is not fully finalized right
- [15:45] now. You can just basically access it
- [15:46] for free, but I believe you'd be paying
- [15:48] for the usage of the AI chat models.
- [15:50] Agent Kit also has some really cool
- [15:52] evaluation tools, but there's also some
- [15:53] aspects of the evaluation that I don't
- [15:55] love. So, let me show you what I mean by
- [15:56] that real quick. Okay, so this is one of
- [15:58] OpenAI's templates. And what I want to
- [15:59] do real quick is just preview it and
- [16:01] just do a quick conversation. So, I
- [16:03] first of all say hello. You can see
- [16:05] what's going on over here. The triage
- [16:06] agent is going to figure out what to
- [16:08] output. And then it basically sends me
- [16:10] back some information and it says to get
- [16:12] started, could you share the following?
- [16:14] You can see I responded to that. You can
- [16:15] see we saw the path that this workflow
- [16:17] took. And now the launch helper agent is
- [16:19] basically creating us a guide on how to
- [16:22] launch this. So regardless of the
- [16:24] output, what I don't love here is I
- [16:26] can't see how the data moved through
- [16:27] each of these steps. So if I close out
- [16:29] of this preview and I click on, you
- [16:31] know, that we want to see what happened
- [16:32] in this condition, it's kind of hard to
- [16:34] see what data just passed through. And
- [16:35] if I click on evaluate, this is where we
- [16:37] could actually kind of, you know, see
- [16:39] those logs, but it's a little bit
- [16:40] confusing. Like you can see the timing
- [16:42] of each of these steps. You can see what
- [16:44] happened. If I click on this triage
- [16:46] agent, we can see that it used GPT5. We
- [16:49] can see the system prompts. We can see
- [16:50] the input right here. And we can see the
- [16:52] reasoning and the actions, but it's just
- [16:54] a lot harder to see the data moving
- [16:56] through the nodes in the way that NIDAN
- [16:58] makes it a lot easier to do because in
- [17:00] NIN with this workflow, you can see
- [17:02] everything's green. You can see how many
- [17:04] items are moving through. When you click
- [17:06] into a node, you can see the input on
- [17:07] the left, you can see the configuration
- [17:08] in the middle, and you can see the
- [17:09] output on the right. So, it's really
- [17:11] easy to follow the data trail and
- [17:13] understand exactly where something went
- [17:15] wrong and what you need to change. But
- [17:17] in my mind, in this OpenAI agent kit
- [17:19] environment, it's just hard for me to
- [17:21] understand what's coming in and what's
- [17:22] going out because you can see here we
- [17:24] have a variable which is input output
- [17:26] parsed blah blah blah. But I don't
- [17:28] exactly know where that variable is
- [17:29] coming from. I would have to come into
- [17:30] here and I would have to try to figure
- [17:32] out, okay, output format, we have JSON,
- [17:34] we have this response schema, and is
- [17:36] this where it's outputting the
- [17:37] information? So anyways, not trying to
- [17:39] get too technical here, but I really
- [17:40] like in Nitn how you can see the outputs
- [17:43] of the nodes. You can see data flow. You
- [17:44] can see the input configuration and the
- [17:46] output. And you can also click on
- [17:48] executions and you can go see all of the
- [17:50] different runs very clearly what
- [17:51] happened in a much more visual interface
- [17:54] than going into the agent builder,
- [17:56] looking at the evaluations, and looking
- [17:57] at all of the logs and having to kind of
- [17:59] look through it like this. It's just a
- [18:01] bit more confusing, which surprises me
- [18:03] because it's so much easier to use if I
- [18:05] was a complete beginner. But they also
- [18:07] do have some really cool evaluation
- [18:08] capabilities with data sets, trace
- [18:10] grading, and prompt optimization. As you
- [18:12] can see here, there's different ways
- [18:14] that you can grade your runs and then
- [18:16] like pass prompts through to see if
- [18:17] they're passing or failing. You can
- [18:19] optimize your prompts, and of course,
- [18:20] you can trace grade. The last thing I
- [18:23] wanted to hit on here was community
- [18:24] support. OpenAI obviously just released
- [18:26] their agent kit yesterday, and we all
- [18:29] know what that company is capable of.
- [18:30] They're it's just really cool what
- [18:32] they're working on. So, I imagine we're
- [18:33] going to see Agent Kit continue to
- [18:35] evolve and evolve. But because Eniden's
- [18:37] been around for 6 years and has blown up
- [18:38] in the past year, there's so much
- [18:40] content, there's so many courses,
- [18:41] there's so many free templates, like
- [18:43] 5,000 plus templates, whereas in Open
- [18:46] AI's Agent Kit, you're a little bit more
- [18:48] on your own right now. Anyways, overall,
- [18:50] we have Agent Kit at 40, we have Naden
- [18:52] at 51. And I wanted to talk about real
- [18:55] quick when you would choose each of
- [18:56] these tools. So, I would choose OpenAI
- [18:58] agent kit if I wanted to prioritize
- [19:00] rapid deployment with minimal technical
- [19:02] complexity. If I wanted a polished chat
- [19:04] user interface or some widgets that
- [19:05] could be dynamic, if I'm looking to do
- [19:07] some really quick and easy comprehensive
- [19:09] agent evaluation and testing. And of
- [19:10] course, if I have everything that I know
- [19:12] about my business already in OpenAI's
- [19:14] ecosystem, it's going to make it really
- [19:16] easy to plug in these custom workflows.
- [19:18] Now, Nen, they definitely were targeting
- [19:20] more of the developers. Flexibility
- [19:22] across multiple AI providers, complex
- [19:24] workflow automation beyond simple chat,
- [19:26] cost control through self-hosting,
- [19:27] complete data and infrastructure
- [19:29] control. You obviously have the ability
- [19:30] to connect to literally anything,
- [19:31] trigger your workflows by literally
- [19:33] anything, and do any type of data
- [19:35] manipulation or transformation that you
- [19:37] need. But making this video was really
- [19:38] fun for me because I think a lot of
- [19:40] people tend to get caught up on tools.
- [19:42] You know, what's going to drop? What's
- [19:44] going to be relevant? What do I learn?
- [19:45] Am I taking a huge risk or gamble? The
- [19:48] answer is no. as long as you're
- [19:50] approaching it from the mindset of I
- [19:52] want to learn when AI is valuable, when
- [19:54] it's not, how to save time, and how to
- [19:56] solve a core problem that is actually
- [19:58] facing the business. Because if you're
- [20:00] trying to work with businesses, they're
- [20:01] probably not going to choose you because
- [20:03] of your specific tool. They're going to
- [20:05] choose you because you know how to
- [20:06] deliver them results that save them
- [20:08] money, save them time, and increase
- [20:09] their focus. So, real quick, the mindset
- [20:11] should be become tool agnostic. Solve
- [20:14] what the problem is at its core. Doesn't
- [20:16] really matter how you get there. So, if
- [20:18] I apologize for the ramble there, but
- [20:19] hopefully you guys understand where I'm
- [20:21] coming from. That's the type of stuff I
- [20:22] love to talk about in this space because
- [20:24] there is a lot of hype. And if you're
- [20:25] looking to connect with a ton of other
- [20:26] people who enjoy talking about that kind
- [20:28] of stuff as well, then definitely check
- [20:29] out my plus community. The link for this
- [20:31] is down in the description. We just hit
- [20:32] 3,000 members, which is super exciting,
- [20:34] but it's full of people that are
- [20:36] building with NAND every day or
- [20:37] different platform. It's a community
- [20:39] full of AI problem solvers. Tons of
- [20:40] people in here are building businesses
- [20:41] with AI or using AI to help their own
- [20:43] businesses. It's a really cool space to
- [20:45] be. And we also have three full courses
- [20:47] right now. Agent zero which is the
- [20:49] foundations of AI automation for
- [20:50] beginners. We have 10 hours to 10
- [20:52] seconds where we dive into naden and
- [20:54] identifying how to save time with
- [20:55] automations. And then we have a new
- [20:58] course for our annual members called one
- [20:59] person AI automation agency where we lay
- [21:01] the foundation for building a scalable
- [21:03] AI automation business. I also run one
- [21:05] live call a week in here which have been
- [21:07] really fun lately. Been getting a lot of
- [21:08] cool questions and cool discussions. So
- [21:10] I'd love to see you guys in this
- [21:11] community. But that's going to do it for
- [21:12] today's video. If you enjoyed you
- [21:13] learned something new, please give it a
- [21:14] like. It definitely helps me out a ton.
- [21:16] And as always, I appreciate you guys
- [21:17] making it to the end of the video. I'll
- [21:19] see you on the next one.
