- [00:00] Hi, I'm Kaz. I'm a developer advocate
- [00:03] for the crowd AI teams. Here I'd like to
- [00:06] show a demo called surplus cons. Uh this
- [00:09] is the demonstration of the ADK agent
- [00:12] development kit with the vati vector
- [00:15] search for the retail data set. So let
- [00:17] me try.
- [00:18] >> Hello, I'm shoppers concierge an AI
- [00:21] agent. This e-commerce site has about 10
- [00:23] million items. What can I help you with
- [00:25] today?
- [00:26] >> Can you find a birthday present for my
- [00:28] 10 years old son?
- [00:30] Okay, I can help with that. Let's find a
- [00:32] birthday. Here are some items I found
- [00:34] for a 10-year-old boy's birthday
- [00:35] present. You can refine or change the
- [00:37] search or start a deep research.
- [00:40] >> Can you start a deep research?
- [00:43] >> Okay, I will use Google search to
- [00:45] research popular items. Is it okay to
- [00:48] start?
- [00:49] >> Yes, please.
- [00:51] [Music]
- [00:52] So now the agent is using Google search
- [00:55] to make a research people are buying for
- [00:59] the uh the birth represent for their son
- [01:01] and then we
- [01:02] >> finish the research and we'll show
- [01:04] search results for the following item
- [01:05] categories stem building kits outdoor
- [01:08] active play equipment creative art
- [01:10] supplies board games and puzzles books
- [01:12] and media
- [01:14] and under the hood it generates a bunch
- [01:16] of queries for a single deep research
- [01:18] query it generates up to 100 quer
- [01:20] queries as you can see on the console.
- [01:23] So rather than having the user uh typing
- [01:26] many different queries on the search
- [01:27] site, you can ask the agent AI.
- [01:30] >> Kazier's picks are the feature items
- [01:32] picked from the deep research results
- [01:35] >> and also you can approach your own image
- [01:38] to tell the context of finding a
- [01:41] product.
- [01:43] For example, if you choose your home
- [01:46] office image or you can use your
- [01:48] smartphones to take pictures desk with a
- [01:50] laptop and a chair. Here are some home
- [01:52] office accessories I found. You can
- [01:54] refine or change the search or start a
- [01:56] deep research
- [01:57] >> so the agent understands what's going on
- [01:58] in the image to try to suggest any
- [02:01] interesting items for the user. And if
- [02:04] you choose one of them, example, this
- [02:07] LED lamp.
- [02:08] >> This is a modern LED desk lamp with a
- [02:10] USB charging port, three-way touch
- [02:13] switch, and adjustable neck. Perfect for
- [02:15] home.
- [02:15] >> So by using the Gemini, you can generate
- [02:18] an image that puts the item to the to
- [02:20] your room images. So this is how it
- [02:23] works. For example, if you go to the
- [02:25] e-commerce website, uh there's a search
- [02:27] engines and recommendation systems all
- [02:29] bit with the traditional machine
- [02:31] learning systems that takes the
- [02:33] statistics from the past purchase
- [02:35] history or click history. But with this
- [02:38] system is the intelligence of the AI
- [02:40] agent because the AI agent is powered by
- [02:42] the Gemini that means that it has the
- [02:45] knowledge like a common sense like a
- [02:47] human conscience. So it understands all
- [02:50] the context like the what if the user
- [02:53] have the this kind of the homework
- [02:55] setups what items they would like like
- [02:58] to buy uh like a test ramp or anything
- [03:00] uh as the additional of the uh the
- [03:02] items. So this is this is the total
- [03:05] difference between the the existing
- [03:07] recommendation systems and the
- [03:09] generative recommendation system with
- [03:10] the AI agents. So if you're interested
- [03:13] uh to get started you can just go to the
- [03:16] GitHub uh page for the ADK. So you can
- [03:18] find it by Google ADK GitHub and so
- [03:22] where you can uh access to the bunch of
- [03:24] the tutorials to get started. You can
- [03:26] just run write a tand of lines of the
- [03:28] Python code to get your first AI agit.
- [03:31] So check the link in the description and
- [03:33] I'd like to see what you would build
- [03:35] with ADK.
