- [00:00] My goal today is to explain the
- [00:02] difference between these three terms in
- [00:03] a most simple language. When you ask a
- [00:06] question to chat GPD as a result, it
- [00:09] will generate new text. It can also
- [00:12] generate uh images, videos and so on. So
- [00:17] generative AI is nothing but an AI that
- [00:20] can create new content either text,
- [00:22] image or video based on patterns learned
- [00:25] from existing data. At the heart of it
- [00:28] there is large language model and this
- [00:31] model can be your GPT4 claude model Gina
- [00:36] etc. It is trained on a huge volume of
- [00:39] internet data okay it can be Wikipedia
- [00:41] text Google books and so on and based on
- [00:45] that it will be generating the answers.
- [00:49] Now if you ask this question, what is
- [00:50] the price of a flight ticket tomorrow?
- [00:52] It won't be able to answer because it
- [00:54] has a knowledge cutff date and this is a
- [00:58] generative AI with only LLM. But you
- [01:01] might have noticed if you ask some
- [01:04] questions to chat GPT you will see this
- [01:06] searching the web text and it will do
- [01:09] the web search and it will return you
- [01:11] the latest information from internet. So
- [01:14] in this LLM if you give an access to
- [01:18] Xedia API or let's say make my trip or
- [01:20] any other travel API then LLM is smart
- [01:24] enough to call this API and fetch the
- [01:26] latest price of a flight. Okay. So this
- [01:30] is getting little more intelligent than
- [01:33] just simple LLM which is trained on some
- [01:35] knowledge cutoff. Right. So LLM is like
- [01:37] a brain and to that brain you are giving
- [01:40] this access of a tool. Right? Let's say
- [01:42] you are a human you have a brain but I
- [01:44] give you a hammer and a screwdriver you
- [01:47] will be able to do even more. So
- [01:48] similarly for LLM these tools then there
- [01:51] is another thing called knowledge. These
- [01:53] are like its hammers and screwdriver
- [01:56] which will help it do even more. You can
- [01:59] also ask book me a cheapest flight
- [02:02] tomorrow from place A to B and using
- [02:06] Xedia API it will first search different
- [02:09] flights then it will decide the cheapest
- [02:12] one and then it will book uh that
- [02:14] flight. So here you are now performing
- [02:18] actions. Previously you are asking
- [02:20] questions simple Q&A but now it is
- [02:23] actually taking action for you. This is
- [02:26] an AI agent. It is a program that takes
- [02:30] input. It will think and it will act to
- [02:34] complete a task. Okay. Agent will
- [02:36] complete task. It's not just simple Q&A
- [02:38] chatboard. It will complete a task using
- [02:41] tools, memory and knowledge. And there
- [02:44] is some kind of autonomy or independent
- [02:48] decision making. So when we looked at
- [02:50] previously see it decided which is the
- [02:53] cheapest flight. So maybe it found let's
- [02:55] say five flights and it figured out okay
- [02:57] this is the cheapest flight and then it
- [02:59] booked it. So it is taking independent
- [03:02] decision. Okay. So it is autonomous but
- [03:05] at the same time the example that we
- [03:08] looked at is very narrow and specific.
- [03:11] Okay. I'm asking okay from place A to B
- [03:13] book a flight tomorrow cheapest flight.
- [03:15] So it's a simple task. It's not that
- [03:17] complex. It doesn't involve u you know
- [03:21] multiple like step reasoning multi-step
- [03:23] planning and so on. But now let's say
- [03:26] you ask even a more complex question
- [03:28] such as I want to travel to New Delhi in
- [03:31] May. It is 7-day trip. Weather should be
- [03:34] sunny on all the days. Flight budget is
- [03:37] less than $1,600. No layover. Now this
- [03:40] is the kind of question you will ask
- [03:42] your travel agent right when you call
- [03:43] it. Okay, these are my five criterias.
- [03:46] Give me the best flight. Well,
- [03:48] apparently AI agents can do this. So it
- [03:52] has access to Xedia for your travel
- [03:54] needs. Now it needs to check weather
- [03:56] also because you like sunny weather. So
- [03:58] what you can do is provide an access to
- [04:01] some weather API you know acue weather
- [04:03] API whatever API and then it will first
- [04:07] check the weather. Okay. So it will look
- [04:09] at the month of May and find seven
- [04:11] consecutive days where the weather is
- [04:13] sunny. For those days it will do a
- [04:17] flight search, compare airlines, find
- [04:19] the flight with a budget less than 1600.
- [04:23] Okay. Not only that, it might go one
- [04:26] step further and give you suggestions
- [04:29] for hotel and airport taxi. Okay. So see
- [04:33] I booked a flight and I also found you
- [04:36] few good suggestions. So this is a
- [04:38] flight booking AI agent. You see here
- [04:41] it's a
- [04:43] flight booking AI agent which is doing a
- [04:46] complex task than the simple AI agent.
- [04:50] You can expand it further because when
- [04:52] you travel across countries you might
- [04:54] need visa. So maybe it can do even more
- [04:57] complex things such as it can call
- [05:00] another AI agent which is immigration AI
- [05:03] agent and this agent is also powered by
- [05:06] LLM obviously but it has access to let's
- [05:09] say some uh immigration APIs it has
- [05:12] access to your one drive where you have
- [05:13] kept your passport and your immigration
- [05:15] records and now this immigration a agent
- [05:19] right this green box will check your
- [05:23] visa eligibility and and it will say hey
- [05:26] you know what your visa has expired so
- [05:28] even before you book a ticket you need
- [05:31] to apply for a visa so this is even a
- [05:34] complex system where there is not just
- [05:35] one agent there are two agents right the
- [05:37] first agent is flight booking second one
- [05:40] is immigration AI agent so the system as
- [05:44] a whole if you think about the entire
- [05:46] system it is doing multi-step reasoning
- [05:48] it is not like okay go and book the
- [05:50] flight ticket it knows that you need to
- [05:52] check visa so it will call visa agent
- [05:54] and check if the visa is there and if
- [05:57] visa is there then it will do further
- [05:59] steps. So it is doing multi-step
- [06:01] reasoning multi-step planning and
- [06:03] working on a complex goal autonomously.
- [06:07] Okay. Now there is some control you need
- [06:08] to give uh uh you need to keep on this
- [06:12] agents. You can't make them fully
- [06:14] autonomous. You can't give them your
- [06:16] bank password. So there is some level of
- [06:18] control that needs to be given. So
- [06:20] agentic AI is a system where one or more
- [06:24] AI agents work autonomously
- [06:27] often over long task complex task making
- [06:31] decisions using tools and even other
- [06:33] agents to reach a goal. Okay. So as you
- [06:37] can see as you evolve from simple
- [06:39] generative AI system with only LLM to AI
- [06:42] agent to agentic AI you are capable of
- [06:46] performing even more and more complex
- [06:48] task. With only LLM you get just Q&A
- [06:52] with the knowledge cutff with AI agent
- [06:56] you can get access to tools and memory
- [06:58] and you can perform narrow simple task.
- [07:01] With agentic AI you can have multiple
- [07:04] agents. It's not absolutely required
- [07:06] that you need to have multiple agent. By
- [07:07] the way, agentic AI can have single
- [07:09] agent only. But other than agent, it has
- [07:12] other components and it is able to
- [07:14] handle multi-step goals with planning
- [07:16] and coordination. Tool usage in genai is
- [07:19] non. AI agent will use tools and agent
- [07:22] also uses the tools and autonomous
- [07:25] decision making is highest. When it
- [07:27] comes to agentic AI, there are many
- [07:30] tools available that you can use to
- [07:32] build agentic AI system. One of the
- [07:34] tools is N8N. So I am showing you the
- [07:37] workflow diagram in N8N. And here
- [07:41] uh LLM will be part of it. Okay. So if
- [07:44] you look at any uh agentic AI system, it
- [07:49] will have generative AI as a core
- [07:51] component of it. Okay. So this entire
- [07:53] system is AI agent and one of the
- [07:55] component is your Gemini LLM model which
- [07:57] is generative AI. So generative is part
- [08:00] of or a component of agentic AI systems.
- [08:04] There are many frameworks available to
- [08:06] build agentic AI systems agnu and so on.
- [08:10] And uh by the way whatever definitions
- [08:13] we have discussed don't take them uh
- [08:16] like too rigidly you know some people
- [08:18] like no AI agent means this and agentic
- [08:21] AI means this. My friend who is a
- [08:24] creator of Agno framework defines these
- [08:27] agentic system into five levels. Okay.
- [08:29] So first level is agent with tools and
- [08:32] instruction. Level two is agents with
- [08:33] knowledge and so on. So different people
- [08:36] define it differently. As long as you
- [08:38] understand this core fundamental which
- [08:41] is agents are able to do uh some kind of
- [08:46] autonomous action for narrow task. And
- [08:50] when you move to agentic AI, your
- [08:53] complexity increases and usually there
- [08:55] are more than one agent. So generative
- [08:57] AI to AI agent to agentic AI, the
- [09:01] complexity of the task that you can
- [09:03] perform increases and it becomes more
- [09:06] and more sophisticated.
- [09:08] Now folks, I have this langraph tutorial
- [09:11] where I have explained how to build AI
- [09:13] agents using this popular framework. So
- [09:16] just watch it out. I have given examples
- [09:18] of how do you build a chatbot with tools
- [09:21] and memory human in the loop etc. If you
- [09:24] want to build build fully agentic AI
- [09:26] system such as let's say you want to
- [09:28] onboard an employee who is joining the
- [09:30] organization then in our AI boot camp we
- [09:33] have this complete project where you
- [09:36] just say okay onboard this new employee
- [09:38] and what it will do is it will add the
- [09:39] employee to HRMS system it will send
- [09:42] welcome email to employees it will
- [09:44] notify the manager and so on. So here we
- [09:47] used clot desktop as a front end and as
- [09:50] a back end we have built an MCP server.
- [09:53] Okay. So that's part of our boot camps
- [09:56] project. I hope uh this particular video
- [09:59] gave you some understanding on these
- [10:01] three different concepts. If you have
- [10:03] any questions post in the comment box
- [10:05] below. If you like this video give it a
- [10:07] thumbs up and share it with your
- [10:08] friends.
