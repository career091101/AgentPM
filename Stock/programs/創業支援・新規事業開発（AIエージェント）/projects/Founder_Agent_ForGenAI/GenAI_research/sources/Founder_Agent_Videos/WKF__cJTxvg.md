- [00:00] what is going on everybody Welcome to a
- [00:02] video on programming in
- [00:05] 2025 using um large language models llms
- [00:10] and uh agents possibly so I see a lot of
- [00:13] kind of critiques and questions about
- [00:17] agents and llms and coding and is it
- [00:19] like all hype and then like some people
- [00:21] love these things and then some people
- [00:23] act like um they're just like a giant
- [00:25] waste of time or they don't understand
- [00:28] like how are people using this or they
- [00:29] just building like really basic apps
- [00:31] only or like what's the deal there and I
- [00:34] think there's two groups of people uh
- [00:36] really three groups one group of people
- [00:38] just gets it one group of people uh
- [00:40] doesn't get it and then the other group
- [00:42] doesn't want to get it and I can't help
- [00:44] the latter group but the uh the second
- [00:47] group I can definitely help at least
- [00:49] maybe a little bit so uh what I'm going
- [00:51] to use today is this thing called open
- [00:53] hands and this is kind of an a agentic
- [00:56] layer and I will admit the term agent
- [00:59] just sounds fancy but for the most part
- [01:02] it is just kind of like a almost a for
- [01:05] Loop some if statements and some fancy
- [01:07] prompting and boom you have an agent but
- [01:10] done in the right way uh it can make
- [01:12] your life much much easier and um
- [01:15] there's also cursor the reason I'm not
- [01:18] going to use cursor here in this video
- [01:20] is you have to pay for cursor it's like
- [01:21] 20 bucks a month and I am a little
- [01:24] annoyed at everything is like 20 bucks a
- [01:26] month um but for the most part uh all
- [01:29] these things are like massive
- [01:31] amplifications of my my actual output so
- [01:34] I do think it's worth it but just
- [01:36] because I don't I don't really want to
- [01:37] keep showing everything that's super
- [01:38] expensive uh or or I just want to show
- [01:41] that you don't have to pay money for
- [01:43] like any of this stuff you can even use
- [01:44] open hands with closed Source or I'm
- [01:46] sorry with an open source open weights
- [01:48] model it doesn't have to be with a
- [01:49] closed Source model um but you can also
- [01:52] do a lot of things I'm going to be
- [01:53] talking about today with uh something
- [01:56] like Claud or even chat GPT the the
- [01:58] actual UI um as you can see here I even
- [02:01] used uh Chad GPT because I was really
- [02:03] struggling with um what are my various
- [02:06] options for um
- [02:09] actually loading uh that deep seek
- [02:13] model I started off thinking I was going
- [02:15] to load fp8 on a CPU uh so that that's
- [02:18] where I came from I like never run
- [02:20] models on the uh on the CPU so anyways
- [02:24] um okay so anyways you can follow along
- [02:27] with a lot of the tactics that I'm going
- [02:28] to use today are are similar across
- [02:31] everything you don't even have to use an
- [02:33] agent but if you are going to use an
- [02:34] agent I do like Open Hands I do like
- [02:36] cursor cursor has their little uh what
- [02:38] is it composer agent or whatever you can
- [02:40] use that too you just have to it I think
- [02:42] there's like a free trial and then you
- [02:43] have to pay for it so anyways uh keep
- [02:45] that in mind I do think this is pretty
- [02:46] cool you can install it essentially with
- [02:48] two commands run this and then run this
- [02:51] and again that's what I'm going to use
- [02:52] but again also the hopefully um I I
- [02:55] haven't done many videos lately because
- [02:57] I feel like there's like nothing that is
- [02:59] uh um nothing is sticking these days
- [03:02] like within a week or two everything
- [03:05] that you you just talked about is like
- [03:06] outdated so that's probably going to
- [03:08] happen today but uh but I these
- [03:11] principles are principles that I've been
- [03:13] using with coding with llms now for um
- [03:17] at least a little bit so uh anyways so
- [03:20] I'm running that second command or
- [03:21] actually did I already no no no yeah so
- [03:23] I'm running that second command and I'll
- [03:24] just open it in a
- [03:25] browser and then boom you're in open
- [03:28] hands now I think if this a first time
- [03:30] you're loading it you do have to set up
- [03:32] uh an API key um I'm using anthropic I
- [03:36] already uploaded um my key but you can
- [03:39] use basically all of these um and then
- [03:42] I'm not actually sure uh if like I'm
- [03:45] pretty sure you can load your
- [03:47] own um like you can set up something
- [03:50] with like uh uh ll. CPP set up your own
- [03:54] little private uh API with that and then
- [03:57] you could run it off that so you don't
- [03:58] have to pay a penny uh if you don't want
- [04:00] to but I like CLA onic 3.5 right now as
- [04:03] my coding model although that varies
- [04:05] from time to time um I swear that model
- [04:07] gets really dumb I think it's just they
- [04:09] change the number of concurrence uh per
- [04:12] GPU uh that's my best guess is why it
- [04:14] gets crappy but uh so anyways to start
- [04:17] you can upload a zip and the zip works I
- [04:20] wish you could upload single files for
- [04:22] some reason that does not work so
- [04:23] usually my opening statement at least to
- [04:25] this agent is one moment I will upload
- [04:29] some well actually I'm just going to
- [04:30] upload a file so I just open with that
- [04:33] um and again every agent is going to be
- [04:34] a little different so there's some
- [04:36] little quirks that are just super
- [04:37] specific to what I'm doing right here
- [04:40] but um not always so and also let's just
- [04:42] move I'm going to move my little head up
- [04:45] here um as for the ultra patriotic
- [04:48] background um I am changing where I'm
- [04:50] putting the camera in this space mostly
- [04:53] because actually the old direction is
- [04:55] filled with a bunch of toddler stuff so
- [04:58] so I like this backr a little better uh
- [05:01] and actually these are all like family
- [05:02] heirloom things the swords on the top
- [05:04] and bottom are from uh the US uh from
- [05:07] the Korean War those are from the uh
- [05:10] Captain EXO and then uh that uh I don't
- [05:13] know if Katana I don't think Katana is
- [05:15] the right word it's a sword I don't
- [05:16] think it's a katana I forget I don't
- [05:18] know what the word is um but that's from
- [05:20] it's like a captured uh Korean sword uh
- [05:23] and then the bayonet is from the Civil
- [05:24] War so slightly different era there but
- [05:26] anyways and then a commission flag
- [05:28] anyways um contining on uh let's
- [05:31] see um upload so we need to upload our
- [05:34] files so for upload and then sometimes
- [05:36] download at least for me open hands used
- [05:39] to the download always worked and then
- [05:41] lately the download does not work so
- [05:44] like whenever you're all done you can
- [05:45] usually click this button and then
- [05:47] download all the files but for some
- [05:48] reason that has not been successful for
- [05:50] me lately but no matter what you do
- [05:52] first of all there's there's a million
- [05:53] ways like you're using just keep in mind
- [05:55] you're using an agent you can do
- [05:58] whatever you want don't let yourself be
- [06:00] like contained in like a little box so
- [06:02] like in in this case like you could just
- [06:04] open vs code in the browser and then now
- [06:07] this yes I trust myself uh you can
- [06:09] upload and download files right here and
- [06:12] what if for example you don't want to
- [06:13] download all those like individual files
- [06:16] you come over to the agent and you tell
- [06:18] it zip up the files and then you come
- [06:20] over here and you just download that one
- [06:22] single zip okay so start thinking in
- [06:24] those terms um now for me I am going to
- [06:27] just upload uh Shakespeare text here and
- [06:30] so I'm just going to slap that in here
- [06:32] now no matter what problem I do here
- [06:35] there's going to be people who are like
- [06:37] oh you just solved like that again you
- [06:39] just started from nothing uh you just
- [06:41] worked on like a simple R&D project
- [06:44] agents don't work for a large code base
- [06:45] that's all a lie it works for large code
- [06:47] bases I'm not going to show you a giant
- [06:49] large code base I also this will be the
- [06:52] third time I'm recording this video
- [06:54] hopefully I can actually get it
- [06:55] condensed into one video and the other
- [06:58] ones were like
- [07:00] three plus hours of recording just
- [07:01] simply because that's how long a big
- [07:04] project takes and really if I was doing
- [07:06] it by hand it would take me weeks like
- [07:08] weeks to do big projects so anyways uh
- [07:11] this is I'm going to try to keep this
- [07:13] really simple um and still show all the
- [07:16] my tips and tricks I suppose for for
- [07:18] working with agents but also hopefully
- [07:20] be able to show you why these things are
- [07:23] so powerful so okay with that in mind
- [07:25] let's go so we have shakespeare. text
- [07:28] and now one of the one of the actual
- [07:30] benefits is quick R&D so for
- [07:34] example imagine uh you don't like
- [07:37] language models like we've been on this
- [07:39] Transformer stick for so long like
- [07:42] wouldn't it be nice if there was
- [07:43] something else uh besides Transformer
- [07:46] models for either language models but
- [07:48] then also in my opinion uh before we
- [07:51] reach like ASI we are not going to be uh
- [07:55] doing it with chatbots I just don't
- [07:57] think so and like the the base core uh
- [08:00] thing the base core element is not going
- [08:03] to be tokens right there certainly not
- [08:06] word tokens so
- [08:08] [Music]
- [08:10] um what is that
- [08:13] word let's just scroll down a little bit
- [08:15] here uh this is Trump's America I
- [08:17] suppose but anyways um what is that word
- [08:21] we I do need to know I need to know do I
- [08:23] have to like re redo this video or not
- [08:25] uh what is Shakespeare's
- [08:28] [Music]
- [08:30] usage of the word
- [08:35] mean um so I don't
- [08:43] think yeah what's the
- [08:47] uh
- [08:53] add anyway um we just got to figure out
- [08:57] if uh
- [09:05] it says Claud says it's unrelated we're
- [09:07] good we're good guys okay so
- [09:11] um so I don't think that like even think
- [09:14] about like humans human intelligence
- [09:16] human intelligence is it the result of
- [09:18] language or is it the result of
- [09:20] communication right and I think language
- [09:23] is like a um an emergence of
- [09:26] communication and intelligence as
- [09:28] opposed to being like The Source okay so
- [09:31] I don't think AI in the future like ASI
- [09:34] type stuff it's not going to be word uh
- [09:37] it's not going to be from uh like tokens
- [09:40] right okay so anyway so what if we try
- [09:42] other things okay that's that's let's
- [09:44] imagine that's the uh the pretext of of
- [09:46] our new project here now that we're 10
- [09:48] minutes into this video that I really
- [09:49] don't want to be three hours so uh so
- [09:51] we've uploaded our shakespeare. text
- [09:53] we're going to use this as training data
- [09:54] and let's say we want to use like an
- [09:56] evolutionary algorithm to train on
- [09:58] shakespeare.
- [10:00] now to begin we could we can do quite a
- [10:02] few things so first of all on
- [10:04] shakespeare. text we could say hey um I
- [10:07] want
- [10:08] to eventually train a language model
- [10:13] on the Shak spear. text file I
- [10:18] uploaded I would like to have the input
- [10:22] be an
- [10:23] encoded uh let's say 15 characters 15
- [10:26] characters and the output be an
- [10:30] encoded three
- [10:32] characters I am not positive on the uh
- [10:37] encoding but I think it would be cool to
- [10:42] uh make that a like bit style of
- [10:46] encoding like make each like uh make
- [10:51] each character the bit representation of
- [10:55] that character okay something like that
- [10:58] hey bro uh something like that would be
- [11:00] really cool right like a language model
- [11:02] that's actually like built from bits
- [11:04] like that would be
- [11:07] uh darn near a Holy Grail I think um
- [11:11] there's all kinds of problems that are
- [11:12] going to likely arise from doing this
- [11:14] bit and coding and I and I promise we
- [11:17] are not going to solve it in this video
- [11:19] uh this is a very complex problem um but
- [11:21] I just kind of want to show some of my
- [11:24] usual things of like working with these
- [11:27] um um agents and large language models
- [11:31] um so one of the things is you would
- [11:32] never approach the agent and ask it to
- [11:36] do the whole thing in one prompt right
- [11:38] that's way too big you would not
- [11:41] approach that problem now maybe in the
- [11:42] future when we actually have ASI we
- [11:44] could ask you know hey hey this is what
- [11:46] I want make it happen and maybe that
- [11:48] will work but today uh you can't do that
- [11:51] just like regular programmers can't you
- [11:52] can't do it that way you have to break
- [11:53] it down into little sub problems and
- [11:55] then solve the sub problem one step at a
- [11:58] time so um so I'm just informing it hey
- [12:02] this is what I I'm headed towards right
- [12:05] um and I think I want to encode it this
- [12:07] way so maybe so I think the first step
- [12:11] we should do is take that uh text file
- [12:16] and create some training data from it in
- [12:20] this way let's create a python file that
- [12:24] first loads this uh text file and
- [12:28] encodes the characters to bits and then
- [12:32] creates the input 15 characters to
- [12:37] Output three oops to put putut putput
- [12:43] to three
- [12:46] characters but uh encoded into
- [12:51] bits can you do that okay so hopefully
- [12:55] uh we'll start off there sometimes like
- [12:56] this agent will like write the code but
- [12:58] it won't make a file I think it's G to
- [12:59] make a file here we'll see what
- [13:06] happens and we want to do uh three
- [13:09] characters instead of one character
- [13:10] because I think a lot of times we'll end
- [13:11] up on like spaces and stuff like that
- [13:14] also um I think if we do only one
- [13:17] character the model will very especially
- [13:19] with like an evolutionary or RL based
- [13:21] kind of algorithm but many algorithms
- [13:24] would learn to predict the most common
- [13:26] letter and then probably get stuck like
- [13:28] in that kind of a like a local minimum
- [13:31] basically and we don't want that so
- [13:34] we're waiting on this thing to hurry up
- [13:35] and code so yeah it calls it pre-process
- [13:37] that's good I mean that's what it should
- [13:39] be called um and we're just kind of
- [13:42] waiting for
- [13:45] it so one of the other cool things um
- [13:48] about agents is you know some people say
- [13:51] that it takes you it takes much longer
- [13:54] to produce code than if you just like
- [13:56] wrote it yourself and sometimes that's
- [13:57] true like sometimes
- [13:59] there's like a really easy solution and
- [14:01] like you you think that you can get the
- [14:03] the AI to do it for you but it would
- [14:05] just be quicker if you just did it um oh
- [14:07] that's cool so it saved at as a numpy so
- [14:09] remove uh so how many training samples
- [14:12] from the first thousand
- [14:14] characters
- [14:17] um I don't know if I want that because
- [14:19] it's it is pro is likely a sliding
- [14:21] window but I'm not really
- [14:23] sure um if I like it being only a
- [14:26] thousand
- [14:30] let me just see if the down this
- [14:31] historically well historically this has
- [14:34] worked but lately it has not worked so I
- [14:35] just want to see if it
- [14:37] works it is not going to work today I
- [14:40] don't know why that is oh no I forgot
- [14:43] this is like when this breaks you have
- [14:44] to like refresh it's it's like super
- [14:46] annoying um but anyways I'll we'll
- [14:49] discuss that momentarily um so here's
- [14:51] the next tip and trick that I like to do
- [14:54] so it's done this already and so as you
- [14:57] can see we already have uh we have that
- [14:59] text file we've got these numpy files
- [15:00] and then we got the python file and as
- [15:02] you continue to increase the size of
- [15:04] this code base you will wind up with
- [15:07] more and more issues along the way so uh
- [15:10] what I like to do is could you also
- [15:14] create a and in this case we'll call it
- [15:16] a readme.md
- [15:17] file that uh summarizes our current
- [15:22] goals and objectives the things things
- [15:26] we've done so far the files in the code
- [15:29] code
- [15:29] base uh actually we'll call the files in
- [15:32] the
- [15:33] workspace and a bit of a
- [15:36] to-do of a
- [15:38] to-do um beyond that please try to to
- [15:43] keep this file up to date so the reason
- [15:46] why I want to do that is as I discuss as
- [15:49] we talk in like this little chat box
- [15:51] here uh the context gets longer and
- [15:54] longer and longer and longer and
- [15:56] eventually it gets a little unruly I in
- [15:58] general I find the correct number of
- [16:01] essentially steps to take now it depends
- [16:03] on the context per step but in general
- [16:06] after by the time I reach like 200 steps
- [16:09] I find it's best to go ahead and just
- [16:11] reset uh reset everything and so in
- [16:13] order to do that you need to at least
- [16:15] have kind of like this running sort of
- [16:17] summary of what's going on what you're
- [16:19] working on and all that to like come
- [16:21] back from so you'll either download all
- [16:24] the files if that actually works um
- [16:26] again historically that has worked and
- [16:27] just for the record of
- [16:29] this so like right now as I record the
- [16:30] version
- [16:31] 0.23 I feel like the version updates
- [16:34] like once a week or something like that
- [16:36] it's pretty frequent so um hopefully at
- [16:38] some point that'll be fixed uh so we'll
- [16:40] see but and and honestly it's been it's
- [16:41] been a lot of fun using this one because
- [16:43] it it updates like so fast and there's
- [16:46] like little things that hopefully we'll
- [16:47] get to see some of that uh in in this
- [16:49] recording um that I'll I'll kind of
- [16:51] point out but like little behaviors that
- [16:53] you see come through that clearly like
- [16:54] the prompting has changed and you're
- [16:56] like oh that's so cool so anyway so now
- [16:58] we have this read me file so again we
- [17:00] can come over here and we can kind of
- [17:01] just see what it's done so far so it
- [17:03] just populates this with some useful
- [17:05] information that if we want to start
- [17:07] over the context the first thing you
- [17:09] tell the the agent when you start a new
- [17:10] chat is please check the readme.md file
- [17:13] to understand what we're doing and right
- [17:14] before you reset you'll tell it you'll
- [17:17] just make sure that it up has updated
- [17:18] the readme.md you should double check it
- [17:21] and you can make any modifications that
- [17:22] you want or whatever but I find that to
- [17:24] be a really great way to uh keep context
- [17:27] down keep everything kind of flowing
- [17:29] pretty good but then yeah not have this
- [17:31] like giant because like sometimes like
- [17:32] that giant context actually makes the
- [17:34] model worse so whether or not you care
- [17:36] about paying for those tokens it's also
- [17:38] just like trying to keep it focused so
- [17:41] anyways coming back to uh where we're
- [17:44] working okay so we got the read me file
- [17:46] very good and we created some samples
- [17:48] now we want to make uh there's all kinds
- [17:50] of stuff that you could do you could you
- [17:51] I I like evolutionary algorithms I just
- [17:53] think they're really cool um but in the
- [17:56] case of binary uh it could be an
- [17:58] evolutionary algorithm it could be an
- [17:59] RNN right it could be all kinds of
- [18:02] things it something something new is
- [18:04] coming for sure it won't always be
- [18:06] Transformers um but so anyways like okay
- [18:09] let's say you want to try an
- [18:10] evolutionary based
- [18:12] algorithm okay so I'd like to try an
- [18:16] evolutionary based algorithm to start on
- [18:20] this data what do you
- [18:23] think um and then also let's check this
- [18:26] pre-process so what I will say is
- [18:31] um um I think that we probably would
- [18:35] want to have more than a thousand
- [18:37] samples most likely but then also one of
- [18:39] the things I want to point out is a lot
- [18:41] of times when I'm working with these
- [18:42] agents I you'll I'll have the agent will
- [18:46] have produced like thousands of lines of
- [18:48] code for me and I won't have even seen
- [18:51] it like I won't even look at it uh
- [18:54] that's how that's where things are
- [18:57] lately and I just think that's pretty
- [19:00] crazy uh so like I get a little bit of
- [19:02] benefit having been a programmer in a
- [19:05] past life that like I know it's possible
- [19:08] I know it's not possible like when I'm
- [19:09] asking the model here to uh use an
- [19:12] evolutionary based algorithm I could
- [19:13] tell it hey use the neat library because
- [19:15] that's a really good library to get
- [19:17] things going
- [19:18] [Music]
- [19:19] um okay this is just a sample I I'm not
- [19:22] sure what it's doing right now uh is it
- [19:24] actually running something what are you
- [19:25] doing so it's pre-processed but then
- [19:27] it's not actually
- [19:31] oh so it is building something I just
- [19:32] don't see it for some reason yet here's
- [19:34] that file so I get I get a benefit
- [19:37] because I know like what is possible or
- [19:39] what exists but again I I do think that
- [19:42] we're kind of at the point now where we
- [19:45] could um you could probably be you could
- [19:48] probably program without being a like
- [19:51] being a programmer at all like you could
- [19:52] ask an agent like this to do things and
- [19:54] just report the
- [19:55] results um okay so coming back here um
- [19:58] an evolutionary is an interesting
- [20:00] approach blah blah blah update the read
- [20:01] me look at that being a being a good
- [20:03] little agent um input 120 bits hidden
- [20:06] layer 64 so I do think that we probably
- [20:08] need two minimum two hidden layers uh I
- [20:11] think that that has been very well
- [20:13] documented that you have to have at
- [20:14] least two hidden layers so we'll go
- [20:16] ahead and add a hidden I think we'll
- [20:18] start with two hidden layers minimum
- [20:20] genetic operations blah blah blah
- [20:22] mutation flips bits with a given
- [20:25] probability comines two parent selection
- [20:28] I do think we want some sort of mutation
- [20:30] and evolution that adds layers adds
- [20:33] nodes removes nodes adds connections all
- [20:35] that kind of
- [20:36] stuff Fitness is slightly above monism
- [20:40] blah blah blah architectural changes
- [20:42] blah blah blah okay so again I I do
- [20:45] benefit from having been like a
- [20:47] programmer working on these things um
- [20:50] literally writing the book on neural
- [20:52] networks you kind of need a second
- [20:54] hidden layer so let's go ahead and um
- [20:56] let's make the
- [20:59] uh default starting point have two
- [21:02] hidden
- [21:03] layers um well how many was it
- [21:07] 64 64 that's just that's well 64 is fine
- [21:11] we'll keep 6 the problem is like you
- [21:13] don't really even need probably 64 uh
- [21:16] two hidden layers um two hidden layers
- [21:19] uh 32 nodes we'll just start there uh to
- [21:23] start um during evolution
- [21:28] we should allow for mutation to add
- [21:34] nodes uh add nodes add nodes
- [21:38] connections or
- [21:40] remove as well as add new
- [21:46] layers adding new layers should
- [21:50] be relatively rare but
- [21:55] possible I'm trying to think if there's
- [21:57] anything else I want to change
- [21:59] so uh coming over here as well uh let's
- [22:01] see so I mean we did we improved general
- [22:04] fitness we did 50 Generations we don't
- [22:06] have very much data um and then it's
- [22:08] also important to recognize the average
- [22:10] fitness I think until average fitness
- [22:12] goes up that means no improvement really
- [22:15] I'm not sure about 50% I guess 50%
- [22:17] because it's it's a zero or a one I
- [22:19] guess that's why how how that's doing
- [22:20] the calculation um and then the actual
- [22:23] predictions I mean most of these are
- [22:25] like special characters um I'm going to
- [22:27] call that Emer
- [22:29] so I'm ready to raise trillion on hey I
- [22:32] just I just created a you know people
- [22:34] always say that language models um can
- [22:38] only produce what they were trained on
- [22:40] like they only know what they were
- [22:41] trained on Boom here's some evidence I
- [22:43] got a model right here it's emerging on
- [22:45] a new
- [22:46] language 7
- [22:49] trillion
- [22:51] uh okay so uh one of the other benefits
- [22:55] of these agents is like I'm doing this
- [22:58] and talking to you again I'm not really
- [23:00] writing code I'm writing English and
- [23:01] that's about it in reality like when I'm
- [23:04] working I'm espe even if I just was
- [23:07] trying to solve this one problem I I
- [23:10] would have four of these up at any given
- [23:13] time five maybe and uh and if I'm not
- [23:16] working on just this one problem maybe
- [23:18] I'm working on multiple problems I'm
- [23:20] still uh I'm going to have many things
- [23:23] up all at once so even if the agent
- [23:25] itself is barely faster than you are if
- [23:29] you're just on that one agent the
- [23:30] difference is while this agent's doing
- [23:32] this I could be off instructing a
- [23:34] different agent to do something else at
- [23:36] a minimum this thing it it speeds me up
- [23:39] I feel like even one agent I'm usually
- [23:41] about 10x my my speed but I can use five
- [23:44] agents at a time so I'm like 50x I mean
- [23:48] it's like it's crazy the the the uh
- [23:50] amount of Leverage that you get when
- [23:52] you're using something like um agents is
- [23:57] it's absolutely staggering
- [23:59] um okay so I'll modify the evolutionary
- [24:01] model blah blah blah Dynamic
- [24:03] architecture mutation types 80
- [24:15] chance hey it improved to 50% but I
- [24:18] think a I'm not sure Best Fitness really
- [24:21] matters I feel like average fitness has
- [24:23] to you have to raise up the average
- [24:25] fitness otherwise you probably haven't
- [24:26] training increase so what is the
- [24:28] population
- [24:30] size possible improvements we could try
- [24:32] a fitness
- [24:33] function okay so I actually I mean it
- [24:36] was a joke earlier but I actually don't
- [24:38] think you want to get rid of this you
- [24:40] you might want to it might actually make
- [24:42] it better but I don't I don't want to do
- [24:45] that it's more fun not to do that uh
- [24:47] waight different bit positions
- [24:50] differently I mean that is the other
- [24:52] thing so one of the common things with
- [24:55] uh with so like with 8bit representation
- [24:58] I want to say the 128 comes from the
- [25:01] fact that you have even though it's
- [25:03] represented in 8 Bits the the zeroth bit
- [25:09] is always going to be a zero or at least
- [25:12] almost always I I think there might be
- [25:13] some scenarios some comment below if
- [25:15] there's what what scenarios that the
- [25:17] zeroeth bit would be a one but you can
- [25:19] almost guarantee success which is why
- [25:21] it's unfortunate that we're still
- [25:23] average fitness 50% like we should do a
- [25:25] little better because you could always
- [25:26] predict that zeroth every eight bit so
- [25:29] like here zero uh 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 zero
- [25:35] uh 1 2 three four five six seven zero
- [25:39] like it should always be a zero uh so
- [25:41] it's shocking it hasn't quite figured
- [25:43] that one out yet but that's okay um okay
- [25:46] wait
- [25:48] different okay first off first off since
- [25:52] we're rep uh I don't even I don't know
- [25:56] if I I feel like that could that would
- [25:57] like confuse the agent potentially so I
- [25:59] don't even know if I want to touch that
- [26:01] uh consider sequence level patterns I
- [26:03] don't think I don't know if I want to do
- [26:04] that feels too too tokeny like
- [26:06] architecture start with larger
- [26:10] layers I'm not sure why would you need
- [26:12] to start with larger layers if it's 8
- [26:14] bit
- [26:15] representation but you do have okay fine
- [26:17] we'll start okay fine okay fine uh let's
- [26:21] go with larger layers 64 each to start
- [26:26] remember though we can always add more
- [26:31] neurons I'd rather start small and grow
- [26:36] rapidly then start giant okay um what is
- [26:42] our current uh increase the PO what is
- [26:44] the population size I don't even know I
- [26:46] have no idea it's not my
- [26:48] code uh let's see if we 100 I feel like
- [26:52] a hundred's a pretty good starting
- [26:54] population but
- [26:56] uh increase the population size to
- [27:01] whatever you think is
- [27:06] best yeah I don't really
- [27:08] know I feel like 100 is actually pretty
- [27:11] good because I also think the population
- [27:13] size I don't know in in this code if if
- [27:15] the population size will ever
- [27:19] grow one moment please while I check
- [27:21] something on my phone
- [27:36] H okay um 64 that's F uh 200 population
- [27:42] Dynamic bit flip I think bit flip is a
- [27:46] potential issue that starts to suggest
- [27:48] to me that maybe our activation
- [27:50] functions
- [27:52] are Dynamic I hate that it does this too
- [27:55] but there there's something else we can
- [27:56] do for that as well so as it
- [28:00] runs oh it's running right now
- [28:03] yes Dynamic evolutionary model
- [28:10] um wait where is the activation where is
- [28:15] our activation function wow I can't even
- [28:18] find
- [28:21] it add node remove node add
- [28:25] layer am I blind
- [28:35] I'll just ask the
- [28:37] model
- [28:38] um what are the activation
- [28:43] functions
- [28:47] for these
- [28:53] layers started here improved to
- [28:56] here yeah it's probably not and I bet
- [28:59] the average was still yeah too close to
- [29:04] 50% waiting bits by position I don't
- [29:07] even know what MSB or LSB stands for I
- [29:12] don't want to Val I don't want
- [29:15] to should
- [29:18] we we could probably improve immediately
- [29:21] if we just made that change uh add Skip
- [29:25] connections yes add Skip connections
- [29:28] yes add Skip
- [29:30] connections yes add attention with uh
- [29:36] let's try to add some
- [29:40] attention it is all you need damn it
- [29:42] we're just going to wind up creating a a
- [29:44] Transformer probably but okay um
- [29:47] Evolution strategy uh add
- [29:50] speciation like in
- [29:52] neat Island model I don't know what
- [29:55] island model
- [30:00] let's also
- [30:04] improve oh man I don't the the the the
- [30:08] calculation is probably um adjusted from
- [30:11] this point but
- [30:15] um uh also
- [30:18] also um let's try to keep the pi files
- [30:23] in the workspace somewhat clean uh
- [30:27] please
- [30:28] [Music]
- [30:30] um put
- [30:33] previous uh evolutionary
- [30:36] scripts that we're no longer using into
- [30:41] a folder
- [30:43] called pref but hopefully it'll do like
- [30:46] multiple things
- [30:52] here yeah so there is no activation
- [30:55] function so that's your problem it's
- [30:58] really yeah an exor
- [31:01] um
- [31:09] exactly with new activation
- [31:13] functions binary sigmoid binary tan I
- [31:17] think a sigmoid would be good because
- [31:18] then we could act we could we would
- [31:19] likely see much more
- [31:26] training binary
- [31:28] and binary okay that's fine I don't mind
- [31:30] a tan and sigo uh output
- [31:34] [Music]
- [31:39] layer I'm predicting all ones oh my
- [31:42] god oh there you go so so you do have
- [31:45] scenarios where you could actually start
- [31:47] with a z or with a one instead of a zero
- [32:02] let okay scale the weights to prevent
- [32:05] saturation add weight initialization
- [32:08] scaling add a biased term to help with
- [32:12] activation improve the fitness function
- [32:14] to consider partial matches uh sure
- [32:18] let's do all of those
- [32:25] probably oh
- [32:33] oh look at him he's still R usually it
- [32:35] forgets to to do what you asked it uh
- [32:38] with respect to the read me file so I'm
- [32:40] pretty impressed that he's remembering
- [32:41] to do
- [32:48] that all right let's see if this
- [32:54] actually model did you put anything in
- [32:56] there so so wait is it putting D hold
- [33:05] on no just evolutionary
- [33:08] Transformer so why
- [33:11] is this I don't know why these two
- [33:14] unless it's using using it it doesn't
- [33:17] look like it is
- [33:28] okay this might be uh the new this might
- [33:31] be an example I think it's actually
- [33:33] probably still running let's
- [33:38] see hard to
- [33:42] say this is all probably just the
- [33:44] spyware around my computer running uh
- [33:46] let's see
- [33:47] [Music]
- [33:52] so let's check in on the current status
- [34:02] yeah okay so this that's what I thought
- [34:04] was would happen so this was this was I
- [34:06] think new as in 0 22 or 0 23 but it used
- [34:10] to be the case that if you had any
- [34:13] command that would take longer than two
- [34:14] minutes you just like couldn't run it in
- [34:16] open hands because it would just time
- [34:18] out it would just say oh this is taking
- [34:19] too long and just give up uh whereas now
- [34:21] it just it like just sends it it leaves
- [34:24] it running and then just sends this
- [34:26] empty command and it should give give
- [34:27] you a result but it's possible that
- [34:29] maybe this is not printing as it's
- [34:32] going um so we'll see if it get let's
- [34:35] interrupt the current process to add
- [34:36] some progress indicator yeah it
- [34:38] literally read my mind so again we're
- [34:41] sitting here this is taking a while I'm
- [34:42] looking at the timer on the recorder 34
- [34:44] minutes and what again I just want to
- [34:47] say while it's doing this I would be in
- [34:49] a different window doing something else
- [34:51] entirely like I'm not going to sit here
- [34:54] and keep staring at this like and and
- [34:56] there's so many things that are very
- [34:57] common so for example let's check in on
- [35:00] the current status there's no
- [35:01] information oh right you have to
- [35:03] basically all your scripts should have
- [35:05] tons of debugging happening in the
- [35:07] console and if not in the console it
- [35:08] should output to like a Json file
- [35:10] something like that so if it takes a
- [35:12] really long time like in the case of
- [35:14] like um Benchmark scripts for language
- [35:17] models for example it might take a while
- [35:19] to run and get the inference for those
- [35:21] benchmarks and then if you want to
- [35:23] perform like analysis or you want to
- [35:25] like work on the logic of extracting
- [35:28] answers from those uh the inference
- [35:31] rather than rerunning over and over and
- [35:33] over just output to a Json and then you
- [35:35] can iterate over that Json right um but
- [35:37] again these are all uh this is all stuff
- [35:41] that you should have been doing when you
- [35:43] were programming as well so you you
- [35:46] you're like we're still in an era where
- [35:48] you you still kind of have to be the
- [35:49] engineer and you still kind of have to
- [35:51] think about like how to break things
- [35:53] down um
- [35:55] and like a big problem break that down
- [35:58] into smaller problem and chunks that you
- [35:59] can kind of solve and use things like
- [36:02] debugging and all that and for more
- [36:04] challenging things generally if you can
- [36:06] come up with like a like a test case
- [36:09] where you would know if it worked if it
- [36:12] passes these tests or you'd be very
- [36:14] confident at least you can come up with
- [36:16] those tests and then tell it this is the
- [36:18] test you would save it to like a file
- [36:20] even and say hey this is the test case
- [36:21] just keep iterating until you can solve
- [36:23] these test cases um and eventually it
- [36:27] will either you know expend a ton of
- [36:29] money or solve the test cases uh and
- [36:32] you'll be good so like there's lots of
- [36:34] like little ways that you still have to
- [36:36] like be a programmer to some extent or
- [36:37] an engineer to some extent but
- [36:39] everything is just so much easier
- [36:41] nowadays um and then let me see here I
- [36:44] will say like at least Claude if if
- [36:46] you're seeing like I apologize or if you
- [36:49] see like the oh now I see what the
- [36:51] problem is if you start seeing that
- [36:53] stuff a lot just you got to clean up
- [36:55] start over cuz it'll be Stu going a loop
- [36:58] forever uh as soon as you start seeing
- [37:00] messages like that like definitely start
- [37:02] the context over all that it's it's a
- [37:04] lost cause at that point okay so now the
- [37:06] fitness evaluation is taking quite long
- [37:08] so for
- [37:10] example there is a big how much what was
- [37:13] my uh memory up to last time I don't
- [37:16] remember H let's first see how things
- [37:20] are
- [37:22] progressing even if it's slow uh before
- [37:25] we go m making
- [37:29] changes uh I think we'd like to see at
- [37:34] least a few
- [37:37] Generations I mean we're definitely Uh
- [37:40] something's happening because we are
- [37:41] using massive amounts of memory um not
- [37:45] quite
- [37:46] sure what or why but uh we can address
- [37:49] that at a later date I'm just I just
- [37:52] really want to see number go up like how
- [37:54] hard is that to show me number go up
- [37:59] let's go ahead and break that then use
- [38:07] numis
- [38:09] vectorization
- [38:10] plus let's use some
- [38:15] parallelization I have 64 total cores
- [38:18] let's
- [38:20] Reserve 12 for me so use
- [38:26] 52 to
- [38:30] process yeah you start seeing stuff like
- [38:32] this you should be on red alert at least
- [38:35] with with Claude ah anything like that
- [38:38] no no no no you got to be careful whoa
- [38:41] look look at it go oh for a split second
- [38:44] it must have hit another error
- [38:46] probably uh that was awesome looking for
- [38:48] a
- [38:50] moment ah I see the problem ah no I know
- [38:54] what to do ah I see ah
- [38:58] there you go as soon as you if if you
- [39:00] have too many awz happening all at
- [39:04] once things are not looking good we'll
- [39:07] see though we'll
- [39:09] see we'll see it's a red flag though
- [39:12] it's a red flag watch closely dang look
- [39:15] at them go uh did I or did I not say
- [39:20] 52 I think it's violating my request
- [39:23] it's probably going to screw up my
- [39:25] video okay we are uh check the timer on
- [39:29] the video 57 minutes 57 and A2
- [39:33] minutes and I have done no coding we
- [39:36] have reached the point of basically here
- [39:40] we got a Best Fitness up to uh
- [39:42] 76% um reached that in generation
- [39:46] 47 I think we only did 50 um and
- [39:50] actually it really probably was it did
- [39:51] 50 but it starts at zero so really it
- [39:53] only had two more Generations so it
- [39:55] sounds like it was continuing to improve
- [39:57] as time went on started to predict valid
- [39:59] asy characters um final uh predictions
- [40:04] show learning of character patterns I'm
- [40:06] not really positive that I would
- [40:07] necessarily agree with that but that's
- [40:08] what it says um areas for improvement uh
- [40:11] more sophisticated fit Fitness function
- [40:13] maybe it it seems like things are
- [40:15] getting better but it if we're already
- [40:16] at 76 and these are the predictions that
- [40:18] we're getting uh my guess is
- [40:22] [Music]
- [40:23] um uh
- [40:25] potentially uh this is more like a local
- [40:27] Minima type scenario um but we'll get
- [40:30] there
- [40:32] um okay so probably the last thing I
- [40:34] would do here is show you guys um well
- [40:38] two things one again I don't know what
- [40:40] step we're at but I don't think it we're
- [40:41] near enough to
- [40:43] reset
- [40:47] uh yeah we're only at step 85 but again
- [40:50] if you did need to reset context for any
- [40:52] reason because this download files is
- [40:53] not working you literally just ask the
- [40:55] model hey could you please zip this
- [40:58] entire workspace into a workspace do zip
- [41:02] file for me thanks uh and it will do
- [41:06] that it probably doesn't have zip
- [41:07] installed but it will just install zip
- [41:09] and put it in um a
- [41:13] workspace um and then from here you can
- [41:16] do all kinds of stuff and like stuff
- [41:17] that I I would just never personally do
- [41:20] um like you just would never take the
- [41:21] time to really make it really nice so
- [41:23] for example is like visualizations
- [41:24] dashboards stuff like that like as this
- [41:26] trains
- [41:27] uh one of the other things that you
- [41:29] could ask uh is hey instead of like a
- [41:31] tensor board necessarily that just shows
- [41:33] the stuff that tensor board could show
- [41:35] you could tell it like hey show me the
- [41:37] the best fitness show me a best fitness
- [41:39] graph over time as it trains like create
- [41:42] like some sort of uh dashboard for this
- [41:45] um and then also things like show me
- [41:47] some examples like every generation so
- [41:49] show me some of the best uh final
- [41:51] prediction examples stuff like that um
- [41:54] and you can kind of keep going with that
- [41:55] but anyway for doing stuff like that for
- [41:57] like dashboards and all that uh it's
- [41:59] really really powerful so anyways um
- [42:02] this is like a perfect stopping point it
- [42:04] was an hour in again I did almost no
- [42:06] coding a lot of that I was just like
- [42:08] looking at something else doing
- [42:09] something else um or talking to you on
- [42:11] camera or like explaining something but
- [42:14] but really the actual input required of
- [42:16] me was minimal to get to this point now
- [42:18] again we did not solve we didn't make a
- [42:20] new breakthrough in uh new language
- [42:23] models or anything like that or we
- [42:24] didn't make ASI today but the point is
- [42:27] you can you can use this to do like if
- [42:30] I'm not recording a video again I'm
- [42:32] doing like five of these at any one time
- [42:35] to try to solve certain different
- [42:36] different problems um so especially if
- [42:38] you're an R&D or something like that it
- [42:40] it is much faster but it doesn't have to
- [42:41] be R&D it can literally be like I use
- [42:44] this with my work for benchmarking uh
- [42:46] large language models it makes it so
- [42:47] much easier to like quickly Implement a
- [42:49] benchmark like any Benchmark there's
- [42:51] always like all these like brand new
- [42:52] benchmarks everyone does them in
- [42:54] different ways everything has its own
- [42:55] little quirks and features and every
- [42:58] model is a little different and it's
- [43:00] just kind of a nightmare implementing
- [43:02] models on benchmarks for example but
- [43:04] doing it with language models it's like
- [43:07] so easy it's so fast like when you're
- [43:10] using something like an agent so anyways
- [43:12] I definitely encourage you everybody to
- [43:14] to try these things out try out Open
- [43:16] Hands use the cursor agent even just
- [43:18] using the chat you know the web UI um
- [43:20] all these things are extremely powerful
- [43:22] um and if you're not using them you're
- [43:23] missing out if you're refusing to use
- [43:25] them uh you're going to be replaced prop
- [43:27] probably so anyways uh that's all for
- [43:30] now uh if if you have questions comments
- [43:32] concerns suggestions something else I
- [43:34] should look at uh let me know in the
- [43:36] comments below if you're interested in
- [43:37] learning about how normal networks work
- [43:39] like at a deep level uh check out the
- [43:41] noral networks from scratchbook at
- [43:43] ns. otherwise I will see you guys
- [43:45] anywhere from a few days to a couple of
- [43:48] years uh till till next time okay bonus
- [43:51] points um I did ask it to do something
- [43:53] and then I left and um I think it
- [43:55] actually maybe worked so uh basically I
- [43:58] just asked it to train uh save like best
- [44:00] fitness and like all the fitnesses to
- [44:02] like a Json and then we could display it
- [44:04] in a live uh dashboard as it trains and
- [44:07] then maybe view progress over time or
- [44:09] something so it looks like it actually
- [44:11] did that and then I just asked it hey
- [44:13] will you zip everything up into a
- [44:14] worksspace do zip because I was having a
- [44:16] problem like doing the download all
- [44:17] files thing so it did that made me a
- [44:20] little zip file um okay so coming over
- [44:23] here uh we will extract come into the
- [44:26] works space and um what were the two
- [44:30] files I already forgot we want to run a
- [44:33] training
- [44:35] dashboard um for the live visualization
- [44:39] and
- [44:41] then oops uh python training
- [44:46] dashboard
- [44:49] um okay we'll see uh and then
- [44:54] finally H what was the other thing
- [44:57] parallel evolutionary transformer.
- [45:00] Pi pull that up and actually that needs
- [45:03] to be uh python python parallel
- [45:08] evolutionary transformer. Pi cool um oh
- [45:12] it's
- [45:13] uh it's acting like it's a local hold on
- [45:17] let me fix that okay so in these two
- [45:19] files this is what we want to do we want
- [45:20] toplace replace workspace with like
- [45:23] nothing now we could ask the model like
- [45:25] you could pass his error to the model
- [45:26] but I don't have time for this so I'm
- [45:28] going to do that save come over here and
- [45:30] then basically yeah do the same thing uh
- [45:33] just get rid of all wait did it not
- [45:35] there we go okay save so then coming
- [45:39] back over to here one more
- [45:43] time okay so things are
- [45:46] training things are laggy as
- [45:49] heck and then we'll come over here I
- [45:51] don't really see anything yet Island one
- [46:02] oh my gosh it's murdering hold
- [46:11] on okay I just can't help myself I have
- [46:14] to go um but uh this is just way too
- [46:17] addicting first of all what the heck
- [46:20] this is not what I was expecting for a a
- [46:23] dashboard um but this is like the
- [46:25] coolest implementation of a dashboard
- [46:28] that I could ever have expected I would
- [46:30] never have even asked for something like
- [46:31] this it does appear that the trend is
- [46:33] going up um and then yeah what I want
- [46:35] for the fitness history is to be both uh
- [46:38] Best Fitness but also the average
- [46:39] fitness I think that would be cool to
- [46:41] track as time goes on
- [46:44] um uh which okay that's easy um and then
- [46:50] uh okay that's fine
- [46:57] so hopefully it'll do all this we'll ask
- [46:58] it to zip it one more time and then
- [47:00] we'll run it and then that will be uh
- [47:02] the end I just can't help myself this is
- [47:04] the coolest visualization I I would
- [47:05] never have made this visualization this
- [47:07] is just so this is just so cool uh I I
- [47:10] just I have to see this um very good uh
- [47:15] okay
- [47:22] great work space. zip to contain all
- [47:28] of this
- [47:36] awesome what is this about oh that's
- [47:38] just historical
- [47:41] okay okay so then we'll come over here
- [47:43] and I'm going to grab
- [47:45] this okay training dashboard run that
- [47:49] and then run
- [47:53] this and finally we will also pull up an
- [47:56] H top
- [47:57] make sure it's doing what we said to do
- [48:01] please uh oh the dashboard's already
- [48:04] running okay so run
- [48:11] that oh this is this must be the uh
- [48:15] average yeah it says so oh my gosh is
- [48:19] this not just the cutest thing in the
- [48:21] freaking world oh my God
- [48:28] [Music]
- [48:29] and it appears to be honoring our
- [48:31] request that's
- [48:39] cool oh my God I'm nerding out over this
- [48:43] this is so
- [48:44] cool oh my God this is the best
- [48:46] dashboard I've ever seen in my life
- [48:58] [Applause]
- [49:02] oh my goodness this is this is so cool I
- [49:04] I I I can't get over this dashboard that
- [49:06] is so so cool so probably I would do
- [49:10] maybe more generations to see if this
- [49:11] keeps going up but uh I'm having way too
- [49:13] much fun that is that is just so cool uh
- [49:16] let's see uh parallel evolutionary
- [49:18] Transformer somewhere in here we got to
- [49:20] be able to pick wait where did it okay
- [49:23] num cores that's fine um
- [49:28] my dog is like licking the floor making
- [49:30] nasty noises for
- [49:31] us uh where is this
- [49:35] uh what was it uh 50 Generations
- [49:41] 50 maybe it's just Islands oh generation
- [49:44] here we go uh can we do that so Island
- [49:47] size 50 Generations 50 let's do um let's
- [49:51] do 200 save that and then I wonder can I
- [49:55] just restart I have no idea I I have no
- [49:56] idea this is not my
- [50:00] code it looks like we
- [50:04] can dude I can't get over this chart
- [50:07] this is the coolest um thing I wonder if
- [50:09] it were going to ruin the chart though
- [50:11] because in the past it looked like like
- [50:13] if this is 15 out of 200 I wonder what
- [50:16] happens to our
- [50:17] chart we're going to find out
- [50:26] come on buddy let's go
- [50:37] outside dude I I love this this is just
- [50:41] so fun this is so fun I would never have
- [50:43] made a dashboard look like this here let
- [50:45] me uh let's see here move this over a
- [50:48] little bit and then maybe do like that
- [50:51] fit my face in there could also just get
- [50:53] rid of it yeah isn't that awesome oh my
- [50:58] goodness I love this I just love this
- [51:01] okay so uh I am kind of curious
- [51:03] what's going to happen because we're
- [51:04] going to run out of space here and I'm
- [51:06] guessing this will not handle for that
- [51:08] but I mean this is we are off to the
- [51:11] this was this is like the this is way
- [51:12] better than I thought it was ever going
- [51:14] to be on this video I'm so excited for
- [51:16] this kind of a visualization that is so
- [51:19] cool I I hope you guys are enjoying this
- [51:21] visualization as much as I am look at
- [51:24] covering over this oh my goodness this
- [51:26] is just like the coolest way dude I need
- [51:27] to I need to learn more about how is it
- [51:31] doing that like I need all my
- [51:33] visualizations to be in the console from
- [51:35] now on that is so cool is it moving it
- [51:38] is
- [51:39] moving oh man oh my
- [51:44] God I just had no idea this was even an
- [51:46] option see this is a perfect example of
- [51:48] like yeah in some in some respects it's
- [51:50] useful to be a programmer because you
- [51:51] know like what's possible what's not
- [51:53] possible but then in some respects it's
- [51:55] like man I didn't even know this was
- [51:56] possible I had no idea this is so cool
- [51:59] this is so cool just I'm dying it's all
- [52:02] with curses oh my
- [52:09] goodness this is so this is mind blowing
- [52:12] to me I wish we had I wish we had the
- [52:14] full history because it it looks better
- [52:16] because like now the gains are slowing
- [52:18] down um but dang dude that's so cool
- [52:23] that is so cool I hope you guys are
- [52:25] loving this as much as I am
- [52:27] I to be honest I don't even care if you
- [52:28] don't uh that is that is super cool
- [52:36] um it is predicting slightly better like
- [52:39] it's getting closer and closer we do we
- [52:41] have a lot of work to do still but like
- [52:42] I said we were never going to solve this
- [52:44] we were never going to solve that um but
- [52:47] this is our this is way better than I
- [52:49] thought it was ever going to be so that
- [52:50] that is super cool um okay now for real
- [52:53] I am going to cut it here I could spend
- [52:55] oh my God I has spent hours at this I
- [52:57] love this visualization that is so cool
- [53:01] uh wow um yeah so anyways I'm going to
- [53:04] stop here uh questions comments concerns
- [53:07] suggestions whatever uh feel free to
- [53:09] leave them below maybe I will have an
- [53:11] update on this because I I definitely
- [53:13] have to keep keep trucking along and I
- [53:15] love this dashboard I I'm I'm going to
- [53:16] like make everything I think I had been
- [53:18] wanting to look into curses for some
- [53:20] time now I just never had the
- [53:22] opportunity
- [53:24] um and like again this is a perfect
- [53:26] example I will I would never have made
- [53:28] this not in a million
- [53:30] years but but the joy that has been
- [53:34] brought to me by my uh agent making this
- [53:37] for me is immense immense uh wow wow
- [53:45] okay yeah that's all that's all for now
- [53:48] I will see you guys in I don't know
- [53:49] another you know a few days few months
- [53:51] couple years who knows uh anyway till
- [53:54] next time use some agents
- [53:59] I I just couldn't help myself I'm back
- [54:01] with some more bonus content um I need
- [54:03] to know two things uh I need to know
- [54:06] first of all rather than having the
- [54:08] sliding window can we make it such that
- [54:11] it has um all of the history so we can
- [54:15] see it more like long large scale and
- [54:18] then also I must
- [54:20] know uh can we make this like a line now
- [54:23] I know that this is just curses like
- [54:26] it's not a graphing library but I really
- [54:29] need to see lines like I need to know is
- [54:32] this doable so um so that's what I'm
- [54:34] going to do I'm I'm first I'm just going
- [54:36] to say
- [54:38] um looking really good uh could
- [54:44] we uh change from a scatter plot to a
- [54:49] line graph for both of these metrics by
- [54:54] chance
- [54:56] I think that would look better also
- [55:00] could
- [55:01] we um add values to the x
- [55:08] axis x- axis uh generation number uh and
- [55:13] then finally what was the other thing
- [55:17] um finally could we
- [55:21] show um all the steps all the steps
- [55:25] rather than oops rather than just the
- [55:31] um a sort of sliding
- [55:35] window so let's code for 200 generations
- [55:40] and when we get to 200 I want to be able
- [55:46] to see from the beginning to end all in
- [55:52] the chart
- [55:54] makes sense
- [55:56] all right let's see let's see if this
- [55:58] can do it um uh I will be super excited
- [56:02] if so I uh this this has this has uh
- [56:05] changed so much for me I don't know if
- [56:08] we can label the x-axis that would be
- [56:10] crazy if we can um this is just so cool
- [56:14] I'm I'm a real sucker for stuff like
- [56:16] this um I'm like just just making like
- [56:19] colors in the in the UI of like some
- [56:21] sort of console stuff like that just
- [56:23] tickles me but this is something else
- [56:26] especially when it had like a legend and
- [56:28] everything
- [56:30] like come on man that is crazy I mean
- [56:34] it's just
- [56:37] crazy we'll see if it makes these
- [56:38] modifications I I feel like the line
- [56:41] graph is probably somewhat difficult
- [56:43] like coating this is probably easy but
- [56:45] making it be like lines I feel like
- [56:47] would be pretty hard without I don't
- [56:50] even know I mean I I know you could do
- [56:51] it but you would almost need like some
- [56:52] sort of graphing package or something I
- [56:54] don't know but even this this is like
- [56:56] really cool I'm just I'm really uh I'm
- [56:59] tripping I'm going to need it to like
- [57:00] always do this for me from like now on I
- [57:03] don't want uh web- based UI anymore I
- [57:06] need this um also I apologize my eyes
- [57:09] are dry as
- [57:12] heck we're having some crazy weather
- [57:15] right now and it's getting very dry we
- [57:17] we have like this massive cold front
- [57:18] coming in um okay
- [57:21] so um cool so I think it's done great
- [57:26] let's go ahead and zip all that up
- [57:30] please into
- [57:32] workpace uh that
- [57:35] zip very good very good very
- [57:38] good
- [57:40] five oh okay I think okay that makes
- [57:43] sense okay that'll make
- [57:48] sense very good um I me let's just see
- [57:51] if it works uh oops what happened here
- [57:53] oh okay anyway uh
- [57:56] blah all right wish us luck everybody
- [58:02] okay I'm not sure what I'm seeing
- [58:05] here I mean that's not terrible I was
- [58:08] really hoping to
- [58:10] like have slashes be used like to notch
- [58:14] up use a slash I think that would have
- [58:15] been pretty cool and then I'm not sure
- [58:19] what's happening down here because it
- [58:21] like was modifying that that's kind of
- [58:23] odd um
- [58:28] maybe we'll go back to the scatters I'm
- [58:30] not really
- [58:41] sure it's just so cool I just can't stop
- [58:44] myself from uh tinkering with this and I
- [58:47] don't know it's just it's what makes it
- [58:48] so much fun is like it gets you straight
- [58:50] to the the fun of programming and again
- [58:53] I think I think it probably varies by
- [58:55] who you know who and why what you know
- [58:57] why did you learn to program do you like
- [58:59] to program or do you just like to build
- [59:00] stuff and like I just want to build
- [59:02] stuff and uh this just makes it really
- [59:05] fun to do so because now okay like I
- [59:07] just I'm trying to answer some questions
- [59:09] you know so like this helps me to first
- [59:11] of all see okay I can actually see like
- [59:13] okay there's a little bit more of a
- [59:14] trend going on here um and now I'm
- [59:18] starting to wonder I mean this is
- [59:19] running really fast as a parallel
- [59:21] process now too and so like if we check
- [59:24] uh htop real quick
- [59:27] um yeah we got we got plenty of of cores
- [59:32] to dedicate to the cause so we could go
- [59:35] longer we could add a much even bigger
- [59:38] population we could add way more
- [59:39] exploration all that so I think that's
- [59:42] probably what I would likely do next um
- [59:47] please don't expect uh more bonus
- [59:49] content though because I I really I have
- [59:50] to stop at some point I just have to but
- [59:52] I mean look at this curve I mean dang it
- [59:54] just it really uh you know it's begging
- [59:56] to like continue onward
- [59:59] honestly I got to do more than 200
- [60:02] apparently oh man this is so addicting
- [60:05] uh anyway yeah agents are awesome yeah
- [60:07] that's just so cool I think we probably
- [60:10] need to put the
- [60:14] um uh the legend like down in the bottom
- [60:17] right you know like that's probably a
- [60:18] better spot for it or like outside the
- [60:20] graph a little bit or something uh or
- [60:22] even like up here like in the in this
- [60:24] little title but uh overall uh yeah
- [60:28] that's pretty cool there's a very clear
- [60:30] Trend here I would keep going I would
- [60:32] look possibly even further into what is
- [60:35] Fitness and all that make sure that's
- [60:37] actually still logical uh we probably
- [60:39] want more than four species I don't know
- [60:41] if that's like the island concept or
- [60:43] what so I'd probably want to look more
- [60:44] into that but again instead of like
- [60:46] looking at the code I mean directly
- [60:48] looking at the code you would just ask
- [60:49] the agent um you know hey what's going
- [60:52] on here why is it only four species oh
- [60:53] it's because the okay let's have more
- [60:55] and like let's have more uh mutation
- [60:58] like you you would keep going from here
- [61:00] um but I mean right now we're actually
- [61:01] on a pretty interesting track like these
- [61:03] these uh predictions aren't exactly uh
- [61:06] perfect but if I recall right we did not
- [61:08] reward for ask not or yeah we did not
- [61:10] reward for like straight up characters
- [61:13] like e j e all that like the model is
- [61:15] just learning that that's probably more
- [61:17] likely what we're looking for and even
- [61:20] that that's cool um I didn't think that
- [61:22] this would get this far to be honest
- [61:24] with you so uh yeah that's awesome that
- [61:27] is just so cool and I love this curses
- [61:29] oh man that just that really did that
- [61:31] like made my day so okay I really should
- [61:34] stop it here uh otherwise this will be
- [61:36] yet again another like 5 10 hour video
- [61:38] so anyways that's all for now
- [61:54] bye for
