- [00:00] We're introducing new capabilities
- [00:02] for managing your agents context
on the Claude API.
- [00:06] Context editing automatically clears
stale tool calls and results
- [00:09] from within the context window when
approaching token limits,
- [00:13] and the memory tool
- [00:14] enables Claude to store and consult
information outside the context window.
- [00:19] Let me show you these capabilities
in action with something unexpected.
- [00:22] A Game of Catan.
- [00:25] Catan is a strategy board game
that requires planning over a long time
- [00:28] horizon, sharp negotiation
skills, and careful observation.
- [00:33] Watch as Claude plays 
against three opponents
- [00:36] Ace, Maven and Scout.
- [00:40] Claude is building a knowledge base
that persists across games,
- [00:44] with memory files
about each opponent's strategies,
- [00:47] like how Maven hoards bricks
or Ace has a stockpile of wood.
- [00:51] As the game progresses,
trades, moves, card draws,
- [00:54] and other events accumulate,
eventually overwhelming the context.
- [00:59] But context editing automatically removes
- [01:02] older, less relevant information.
- [01:06] After 75 minutes of play,
- [01:08] Claude has processed
thousands of game events.
- [01:11] Yet the context remains clean and focused.
- [01:15] These features are now available
on the Claude Developer Platform.
