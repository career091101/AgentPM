- [00:00] So this next fireside chat will have you
- [00:02] thinking about Agentic AI and how it can
- [00:04] reshape enterprise architecture. Please
- [00:07] welcome Arman with IBM and Sam with Red
- [00:11] Dragon AI. Good morning everyone. It's
- [00:13] nice to see everyone so early. Um Aman,
- [00:17] what I thought we'd start off with is so
- [00:19] we were having a really interesting
- [00:20] conversation backstage that both of us
- [00:22] have sort of worked in AI when it really
- [00:24] wasn't cool at all and we've sort of
- [00:27] seen changes over the years. I thought
- [00:29] let's start off. What are you seeing uh
- [00:31] at IBM? Some of the changes since sort
- [00:34] of the generative AI revolution sort of
- [00:36] took off. What are you saying customers
- [00:38] want? What are you seeing sort of
- [00:40] products that kind of thing? Yeah. Well,
- [00:43] thank you and uh glad to be here. I've
- [00:46] been working in AI for 14 years and we
- [00:49] were talking backstage. I was working AI
- [00:51] when AI was not cool. At some point, not
- [00:53] that long ago, I was on the on the side.
- [00:55] you just go do your AI thing here on the
- [00:57] corner. We're here in the company to go
- [00:59] make money on other things, right? Uh
- [01:02] predictive analytics, statistics,
- [01:04] machine learning, deep learning, and
- [01:06] then uh I I always say Chad GPT did the
- [01:10] marketing that we've been trying to do
- [01:12] with Watson for the last 10 years. Uh we
- [01:15] put billions of dollars to try to
- [01:16] promote AI and didn't do the click. The
- [01:19] technology was not there. Uh but uh with
- [01:22] LLMs, everything changed. So um as you
- [01:25] know um we acquired Red Hat a few years
- [01:28] ago and that was for us like the
- [01:30] beginning of um going after customers
- [01:33] that were we we saw a trend that they
- [01:35] were not committing to one single cloud
- [01:37] provider. They had this ask to go
- [01:39] multicloud and with AI we've seen
- [01:43] exactly the same pattern happening all
- [01:44] over again. Customers are not going all
- [01:46] in in one single LLM or one single
- [01:49] provider. They want a lot of
- [01:50] flexibility. So yeah, big of the focus
- [01:53] has been to provide a platform that
- [01:56] provides all that flexibility for
- [01:57] customers to go build different use
- [01:59] cases. So so that's something really
- [02:01] interesting that IBM didn't really get
- [02:03] in the whole sort of fight to be the
- [02:05] foundation model and is that because
- [02:08] that you guys saw that people just
- [02:09] wanted so many different solutions? We
- [02:11] we tried in fact we have our family of
- [02:14] LLMs uh you can go check it out is
- [02:16] Granite which we later open source I can
- [02:19] tell you about the whole story there. Uh
- [02:21] so we do have very good small uh
- [02:23] language models that are very easy to
- [02:25] customize. Our big obsession is cost per
- [02:28] token and how for task specific uh use
- [02:32] cases you can get even better
- [02:35] performance that uh with LLMs that are
- [02:37] like 100 times larger size and they are
- [02:40] very easy to customize. So we are
- [02:41] obsessed with all our customers they
- [02:43] have a lot of data and how they can
- [02:45] leverage that data for genai. We believe
- [02:48] that's the the secret sauce, the secret
- [02:50] IP. Uh but uh we didn't go into a big
- [02:53] fight to go compete with uh OpenAI,
- [02:57] Gemini and all these very very large
- [02:59] models and we just partnered with them
- [03:01] and we I'm bringing my Mistral hat.
- [03:05] They are a big partner of ours as well.
- [03:06] So yeah, we provide a lot of choice for
- [03:08] our customers. So I I know that sort of
- [03:11] based on that you're sort of launching a
- [03:13] new product this week, right? That Yeah.
- [03:15] Yeah. Um so we following that pattern we
- [03:19] started with thinking okay the market is
- [03:22] going to choose one LLM and you remember
- [03:24] maybe two years ago the big conversation
- [03:26] was like one LLM that will rule them all
- [03:29] and so on. Then we very quickly went
- [03:31] into uh distributed AI systems and a lot
- [03:34] of choice and I think the the biggest
- [03:37] ones that made a big statement in the
- [03:38] market with open source were Mistral and
- [03:40] Lama from Meta. Um and then we came with
- [03:44] our granite series as well open source
- [03:46] but at the end of the day customers they
- [03:47] just don't want one model or the other
- [03:49] they also want sometimes closed source.
- [03:51] I have a talk actually this afternoon to
- [03:53] cover on that topic. So we are releasing
- [03:55] a a model gateway. So we have customers
- [03:57] that maybe they want open source on on
- [04:00] one use case running on one inference
- [04:02] stack and for some other use case they
- [04:04] want to go tap directly into um bedrock
- [04:06] on AWS and for another use case they
- [04:08] want to use Google cloud with Gemini on
- [04:11] GCP. So uh that gateway is providing our
- [04:15] customers a single layer of uh with a
- [04:17] single API to go switch from one API to
- [04:20] one LM to another LM and add
- [04:22] observability and governance all
- [04:23] throughout. So and that sort of helps
- [04:25] protect them with
- [04:26] and provides ultimal flexibility really.
- [04:28] they can have their own inference stack
- [04:30] on prem for one use case maybe someone
- [04:32] some use case that is very sensitive on
- [04:34] on data security and and compliance and
- [04:36] then for something less risky they can
- [04:39] go tap into some public API so for for a
- [04:41] typical org that you're working with how
- [04:43] many LLMs are they actually using I mean
- [04:45] I when I sit in front of a customer they
- [04:48] are using everything they they have
- [04:49] access to everything like for coding uh
- [04:52] they love entropic and and for some
- [04:55] other use case for reasoning they like
- [04:56] 03 and Then for uh LLM customization
- [05:00] with their own data and do tuning they
- [05:02] like e either our granite series or
- [05:05] mistral with their small models or even
- [05:06] llama. So they they have the full stack
- [05:10] it it's just matching uh the the LLM to
- [05:13] the right use case and and then they we
- [05:16] help them as well to make
- [05:17] recommendations. So that really sort of
- [05:18] blows out the water of this idea that
- [05:20] people are just going to pick one model
- [05:22] and they they have them all. So I I like
- [05:25] to say we like to be kind of like the
- [05:26] control tower of all those AI workloads.
- [05:29] No matter where where they are happening
- [05:31] and and yeah and and they can build
- [05:34] agents with our full stack and if you
- [05:35] are fully uh vertical we provide some
- [05:38] very nice optimizations but at the end
- [05:40] of the day they will use Salesforce
- [05:43] agent for service now their own thing
- [05:45] for for uh some custom use cases. So we
- [05:48] want to be at the center uh handling all
- [05:50] that all those workloads. So, so I think
- [05:52] that's really interesting because you're
- [05:53] getting a snapshot of sort of what are
- [05:55] you know IBM's obviously got a lot of
- [05:57] big customers and stuff. I What are the
- [05:59] other things that people are starting to
- [06:01] delve into? Like we're we're now seeing
- [06:02] you had a really interesting post
- [06:03] recently on LinkedIn about agents and
- [06:05] the different waves of agents. Uh what
- [06:08] are you seeing your customers do with
- [06:09] agents now? Yeah, big part of my focus
- [06:13] and I also encourage you to to check
- [06:15] some of my content on LinkedIn because I
- [06:16] try to be quite provocative there. uh
- [06:19] but uh at the beginning was chat bots
- [06:21] for everything and I don't want to say
- [06:25] like chat we should all have our
- [06:27] personal chatbot customized with access
- [06:29] to our tools like everyone in in in our
- [06:32] company should have that for sure but if
- [06:35] you are just doing chat bots or you're
- [06:36] only trying to do cost savings with AI
- [06:39] you are not doing AI I think AI is
- [06:41] really about completely transforming the
- [06:44] workflow and the way work is done and
- [06:46] and yeah we I'm very passionate about
- [06:49] that topic to completely reshuffle the
- [06:51] the the use cases completely and and I
- [06:55] can give you some examples of things
- [06:56] that we do internally at IBM or things
- [06:58] that we do with customers. Do you want
- [07:00] to give us give us a Yeah. Like I know
- [07:02] sort of at Red Dragon AI one of the
- [07:03] things that we're seeing taking off a
- [07:04] lot is triggered agents. So agents that
- [07:07] are not necessarily activated by a chat
- [07:10] sort of in thing but some kind of you
- [07:11] know could be IoT, it could be something
- [07:13] else that triggers the agent to take
- [07:15] off. Yeah. So um a term that is um being
- [07:20] used a lot this year is orchestration
- [07:22] right um and in fact we have a a product
- [07:25] called uh Watson orchestrate what's on X
- [07:28] orchestrate which has been around for
- [07:30] for for a while now and it's this
- [07:33] concept of and and Jensen put that very
- [07:35] well on on his GTC keynote you have this
- [07:38] super agent at the beginning that is
- [07:39] kind of like a router that will uh
- [07:41] invoke other agents right and then we
- [07:44] can go into protocols for that agent to
- [07:46] agent communication but for example in
- [07:48] HR we have our HR agent I mean I used to
- [07:53] talk to HR I I I'm leading an
- [07:54] organization with over 600 people right
- [07:56] now so um I used to spend a lot of time
- [08:00] talking to my HR partners for a lot of
- [08:02] things I handle most of it now with a
- [08:05] with an HR agent and depending on on the
- [08:08] question if it's something about
- [08:09] compensation or it's something about uh
- [08:12] just handling a separation or hiring
- [08:14] someone or doing a promotion And all
- [08:16] these things will connect with different
- [08:18] HR or internal systems and they those
- [08:20] will be like separate agents. So you
- [08:22] have the core agent that is kind of uh
- [08:24] routing to different agents and and what
- [08:27] is also very interesting is how we are
- [08:29] reinventing the interfaces right. This
- [08:31] is not taking giving you like the text
- [08:33] with the instructions and you need to go
- [08:34] follow step by step. It's allowing you
- [08:36] to do things in context and complete
- [08:39] full actions directly uh within the
- [08:42] interface of the of the agent which I
- [08:44] think is also another part that is very
- [08:46] critical is reinventing like user
- [08:48] interfaces. We are used to micromanage
- [08:51] computers. everything we want the
- [08:53] computer to do, we need to click and
- [08:54] tell the computer what to do and agents
- [08:56] is going to help us just go from A to B
- [08:59] to C much faster. So you you kind of
- [09:02] brought up this whole idea of multi-
- [09:04] aents and you also mentioned protocols.
- [09:06] I know one of the things that has been
- [09:08] interesting that IBM has been working on
- [09:10] is developing some of these protocols
- [09:12] themselves. Uh you've got a new protocol
- [09:15] or it's been out for a little while now
- [09:16] called ACP which you've donated to Linux
- [09:19] Foundation. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah.
- [09:21] Yeah. So I mean I I'm a I'm very
- [09:23] passionate about protocols because we
- [09:25] tackle some of these implementations
- [09:26] very early on and what happens is that
- [09:28] we start doing a lot of custom
- [09:30] development to connect to every single
- [09:32] API to every single tool to do like a
- [09:35] specific agent to agent communication.
- [09:37] So I think protocols like in the
- [09:39] internet are helping. It's like it's
- [09:41] like manners when we are speaking uh
- [09:43] between us right it's like saying please
- [09:45] and thank you you that helps have a
- [09:48] smooth communication so you see these
- [09:50] protocols now raising um so MCP we all
- [09:54] love it so I think we have a slide about
- [09:57] yeah yeah we we comparing some of these
- [09:59] so we have MCP which is really like the
- [10:01] protocol that is allowing us to do like
- [10:04] this connection to to all the
- [10:06] application SAS APIs and and make that
- [10:08] very simple Um we announced ACP in here
- [10:12] in actually here in in formation um in
- [10:16] in March and then two weeks later Google
- [10:18] announced A2A and those two are really
- [10:21] doing the same the thing that I was
- [10:22] talking about like we we we see this
- [10:26] market of having a lot of different
- [10:28] agents and they need to communicate
- [10:30] between them and and we were doing all
- [10:32] these build uh custom builds and
- [10:34] development for that communication and
- [10:36] we are we've been developing protocols
- [10:38] in order to do that. um ACP and now
- [10:42] since yesterday A2A they are both part
- [10:43] of the Linux Foundation. I think that's
- [10:45] very good news because we have open
- [10:46] governance and a lot of companies
- [10:48] contributing. The difference between
- [10:51] them is mostly on the technical side.
- [10:54] Yeah. You you've been checking ACP
- [10:55] lately. Yes. Yes. Is it know it's
- [10:57] interesting um you've definitely got
- [10:59] some nice things that with ACP where you
- [11:01] don't need an SDK. I I find it really
- [11:04] kind of interesting with both of these
- [11:06] at the moment. Everyone's sort of
- [11:07] talking about multi-agent strategy and
- [11:09] they're really talking about agents in
- [11:10] their own org. But it does seem sort of
- [11:13] going forward that you will have like
- [11:15] one provider of a specific agent that
- [11:17] your your agent will reach out to them
- [11:19] to maybe process PDFs. They'll reach out
- [11:22] to some other you know things and maybe
- [11:24] even sort of negotiate with two or three
- [11:26] to work out the best price and then you
- [11:28] know do all this on the fly. Tell us a
- [11:30] little bit about that future. I think
- [11:32] you you've sort of looked at the similar
- [11:33] kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So just to be
- [11:36] clear, I think the difference between
- [11:38] ACP and A2A is rather technical and uh
- [11:42] if you're doing an implementation, I
- [11:43] think you need to pay attention on on so
- [11:45] uh how the communication between the the
- [11:49] um the agents work and how like the
- [11:52] simplicity to integrate that is is
- [11:55] mostly at that I think eventually all
- [11:57] these things will converge and become
- [11:58] even simpler. Um, one part I'm very
- [12:01] focused on is I and I have
- [12:04] responsibilities everything what we call
- [12:05] agent ops and monitoring uh evaluation.
- [12:10] We released a tracing service last
- [12:11] Friday. It's on closed beta as well and
- [12:14] then um governance. So um yeah we we see
- [12:19] our some of our customers that are doing
- [12:21] pilots they have already over 100 agents
- [12:23] and and we see this agentic storm coming
- [12:26] in. So we are building kind of like
- [12:28] those interfaces. So you can monitor all
- [12:30] those agents and then you have a tracing
- [12:33] service that is basically capturing
- [12:34] every single trace everything that is
- [12:36] happening in the AI system and you are
- [12:39] very quickly overwhelmed. So we're
- [12:40] adding an agent on top that will help
- [12:43] you navigate all that information. So I
- [12:45] think in this crazy world where you have
- [12:48] all this agent to agent communication um
- [12:50] is important to have that uh monitoring
- [12:52] under control. And I really like the
- [12:54] that I'm sure many of you watched the um
- [12:57] Andre presentation last week. He could
- [13:01] talk about an AI slider um like full
- [13:04] automation. I think we're really far
- [13:05] especially in the enterprise, but like
- [13:08] there there are a lot of use cases where
- [13:09] you you can have a lot of human in the
- [13:11] loop checkpoints and you can get a lot
- [13:13] of value. Yeah. So I I think that's a
- [13:16] really interesting point. A lot of us
- [13:17] are sort of seeing that people who are
- [13:19] actually building agents realize you
- [13:22] don't want to give these things high
- [13:23] agency. You don't want to give them too
- [13:25] much sort of free will. Uh you actually
- [13:28] want to sort of have them on rails. You
- [13:30] want to have them in a way that they can
- [13:32] be checked by humans. That kind of
- [13:33] thing. I how are you can you give us an
- [13:36] example with customers or something with
- [13:38] that? That was really Yeah. And and
- [13:39] there was also some someone that posted
- [13:41] something similar and we experienced
- [13:43] that like you can have like coding
- [13:44] coding has been one of the top use cases
- [13:46] and I think you you saw here yesterday
- [13:48] some demos as well about that. So coding
- [13:51] is I mean developers are creating tools
- [13:53] for developers. So it's obvious that is
- [13:55] the first use case. Uh but if you see an
- [13:58] a coding agent you are not going to put
- [14:00] the coding agent to do like a two-hour
- [14:01] task. We ask the agents to do a specific
- [14:03] task that usually take a few minutes you
- [14:06] know. So yeah like that full agency uh
- [14:09] that of like go create an app and do
- [14:12] everything to put it all the way into
- [14:13] production is not happening. You ask you
- [14:16] have those agents to do like micro task
- [14:18] and they are getting better at do them
- [14:19] end to end but they are not able to do
- [14:22] like the full job entirely. So um we
- [14:25] will get there eventually but still even
- [14:27] if we get there we need to have all that
- [14:30] monitoring tracing that I mentioned and
- [14:33] and that should be what what I what I
- [14:35] experienced over the last decade working
- [14:37] in ML. This is always an afterthought
- [14:40] and it has to be built in from the very
- [14:42] beginning because otherwise then it's
- [14:43] after to to set it up. So I'm really
- [14:46] curious to find from you you obviously
- [14:48] you're working with a lot of sort of top
- [14:49] companies etc. a Fortune 100 company,
- [14:52] how many agents do you think they're
- [14:53] going to end up having sort of a year
- [14:55] from now, two years from now, three
- [14:57] years from now? Yeah, I I think every
- [14:59] employee will have like between five and
- [15:02] 10 mini agents. And I'm I'm something
- [15:04] I'm very passionate about as well is B
- [15:06] coding uh for the enterprise. Um because
- [15:10] I think I mean we I I can tell you a use
- [15:13] case that I'm facing right now. We we
- [15:15] send uh spreadsheets um for some some
- [15:19] specific ask that we do to all my
- [15:21] managers in my orc and they send me
- [15:22] spreadsheets and then I have to I have
- [15:25] someone consolidating the input from all
- [15:27] those spreadsheets. We can create agents
- [15:28] for that to do that consolidation. But
- [15:31] we are thinking okay we can do by coding
- [15:33] and just create a quick application for
- [15:37] something very specific that will
- [15:39] automatically h get all the data
- [15:41] consolidated into into one single
- [15:43] dashboard. So we don't have like uh 50
- [15:45] spreadsheets floating around every every
- [15:48] two weeks. Uh we could have an agent to
- [15:50] do the consolidation or we can even
- [15:52] build an an app and with VIP coding you
- [15:54] can have someone that is not an expert
- [15:57] on on on the development side to create
- [15:59] some of that. So I think yeah between
- [16:01] five and 10 agents for different task
- [16:03] will be like regular. So we okay that's
- [16:06] really interesting. So when you talk
- [16:07] about vibe coding, I'm guessing you're
- [16:08] not just talking about sort of
- [16:10] traditional coders or programmers.
- [16:12] You're talking about other marketers,
- [16:14] other people. Right. Right. Right. Yeah.
- [16:15] Yeah. And then and um I'm a big fan of
- [16:17] Lovable. I don't know if you if you used
- [16:20] it. Uh but I I actually recommend
- [16:22] everyone in in my teams to and to my
- [16:25] customers to go try it out. Don't get
- [16:27] scared thinking, hey, this is for
- [16:28] developers. just spend like two or three
- [16:30] hours and you will be blown away because
- [16:32] I'm sure like everyone has like a
- [16:35] million ideas on how to improve this or
- [16:37] that or things maybe for their personal
- [16:39] consumption and in two or three hours
- [16:41] you will get those ideas done that
- [16:43] doesn't mean that they are ready for
- [16:44] production that doesn't mean that they
- [16:46] are secure or ready for enterprise but
- [16:48] you will see the art of the possible of
- [16:49] what's coming and two weeks ago it was
- [16:52] completely free for the entire weekend
- [16:54] and my wife and the kids were out for
- [16:55] the weekend so I literally spent 20
- [16:57] hours that weekend just doing a lot of
- [17:00] things and that I didn't code for the
- [17:02] for the last five or six years and it's
- [17:04] amazing how much I got done. So uh
- [17:07] yesterday in the workshop that I did
- [17:09] there was it was really interesting that
- [17:10] there were a lot of people there who
- [17:12] weren't you know uh technical at all yet
- [17:14] sure enough they had tried some of these
- [17:16] tools they were now looking into sort of
- [17:18] building their own agents that kind of
- [17:20] thing I as we sort of go forward into
- [17:23] this new world what what do you think
- [17:25] those kind of people are going to want
- [17:27] in in sort of products so you mentioned
- [17:29] a really interesting one that perhaps
- [17:30] those people are not going to be able to
- [17:31] build software that's totally secure so
- [17:34] you will have maybe other agents that
- [17:36] make it secure or things like that. Do
- [17:38] you put see foresee that? Yeah. Yeah.
- [17:39] Absolutely. I think that's why I'm
- [17:41] saying like there is a something about
- [17:43] coding for the enterprise and uh
- [17:46] something that we are working as well is
- [17:48] there are cataloges of agents that are
- [17:50] off the shelf that should be like
- [17:52] approved by your uh company and
- [17:54] procurement and and so on. We're working
- [17:56] as well on on tool cataloges that are
- [17:58] fully compliant. And I I mean one of the
- [18:01] big gaps of NCP is security and access
- [18:04] control and it's been improving and uh
- [18:06] the community has been asking for it and
- [18:09] and contributing. I think we're going to
- [18:11] get we're going to get there like the
- [18:13] holes are much larger because when you
- [18:15] have when you lose control with
- [18:17] automation uh you need to have very
- [18:19] strong protocols and very strong
- [18:20] guardrails on all those solutions but uh
- [18:23] yeah I think we're we are we're we're
- [18:24] getting there. It's like the next 18
- [18:26] months will be super powerful. So
- [18:27] another application uh something that we
- [18:29] acquired u recently is called data
- [18:32] stacks uh it's a big um database company
- [18:35] but they they acquire a company in
- [18:37] Brazil called Langflow which allows
- [18:40] users to do like aentic solutions end to
- [18:43] end with a visual interface. So again
- [18:46] like giving we I'm I've been obsessed
- [18:48] over my career of giving power to to
- [18:50] knowledge workers andmemes to take
- [18:53] benefits of machine learning and AI and
- [18:55] I think there will be like a combination
- [18:57] of solutions no code low code agent
- [19:00] builders VI coding it's all going into
- [19:02] that direction. Okay so I'm conscious
- [19:04] that we've only got a bit over a minute
- [19:05] left. Let me put you on the hot seat. Um
- [19:08] time frames right because everyone knows
- [19:11] that everyone can predict time frames
- [19:12] right. What do we see a year from now?
- [19:14] what do we see like you know going out
- [19:16] or or even sort of six months from now
- [19:18] like I've been amazed just how much the
- [19:20] sort of coding thing has changed in the
- [19:22] last six months tell us what what do you
- [19:24] think is going to happen in the
- [19:26] workplace in the workplace yeah yeah
- [19:27] yeah I think I mean if you use chajp um
- [19:30] I mean for me the biggest feature of
- [19:31] chajp is a connection to tools and
- [19:33] memory I think we will see exactly this
- [19:35] like you need to be in six months from
- [19:37] now at that same level with your
- [19:39] company's information if you are not
- [19:40] doing that you are lag behind uh and
- [19:43] then and Then from there I think that's
- [19:45] the that's the base to start thinking on
- [19:48] um on agentic workflows and reinvention
- [19:51] of of the way you do use cases and I
- [19:54] think just remember everyone we are in
- [19:56] in day zero still in AI. So uh yeah
- [19:59] there is there is so much to build and I
- [20:02] I keep saying everyone needs to learn AI
- [20:04] and especially business leaders need to
- [20:07] be AI first leaders and and understand
- [20:10] the concepts. I think that's a great
- [20:11] point to wrap it up on. Thank you Aman.
- [20:13] Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
- [20:14] Thanks everyone.
