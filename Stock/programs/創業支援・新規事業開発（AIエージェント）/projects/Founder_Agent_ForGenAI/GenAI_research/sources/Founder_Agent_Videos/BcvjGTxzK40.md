- [00:00] I've got something really exciting that
- [00:01] I've been exploring recently that I want
- [00:03] to share with you. It's all about
- [00:05] creating aic experiences with something
- [00:07] called AGUI. Now, let me set the stage
- [00:10] for you a bit first. There's a good
- [00:12] chance that you're stuck on the idea
- [00:14] that we need to be building apps or SAS
- [00:17] platforms around our AI agents. But that
- [00:20] isn't where the future is headed. The
- [00:22] real shift is embedding agents into our
- [00:25] applications so they become a natural
- [00:27] part of the product experience. And it
- [00:29] seems natural, right? I mean, when the
- [00:30] AI height bubble bursts, the products
- [00:32] that are going to be left over are
- [00:34] generally not going to be the ones
- [00:35] competing as agents, but instead the
- [00:38] ones that deeply integrate AI agents
- [00:40] into a product that delivers its own
- [00:42] unique value. That's what I mean by
- [00:45] agentic experiences and the future of
- [00:47] SAS because these platforms are the ones
- [00:49] that are not going to be wiped out as
- [00:51] our more general agents like chat GP and
- [00:54] operator get more powerful and make the
- [00:56] more niche agents just simply
- [00:58] irrelevant. So right now I'll introduce
- [01:00] you to how to build these kinds of
- [01:01] agentic experiences which are not
- [01:03] trivial by the way generally a lot
- [01:05] harder than building isolated chat bots.
- [01:08] But luckily I have the tech stack for
- [01:10] you to make it simple. So, I'll
- [01:12] introduce you to that, get into some
- [01:14] demos and really important principles,
- [01:16] and then we'll build together. I'll even
- [01:17] take an agent that I've created
- [01:19] previously on my channel and create a
- [01:21] full application around it. So, the
- [01:23] primary part of our tech stack here is a
- [01:26] protocol developed by the C-pilot Kit
- [01:28] team called AGUI. I covered it on my
- [01:31] channel around when it first came out.
- [01:33] Super powerful stuff. Now, the big
- [01:35] question is, what does this actually do
- [01:36] for us? Well, simply put, AGUI
- [01:39] standardizes how front-end applications
- [01:41] connect to AI agents. It's like MCP, but
- [01:45] instead of connecting agents to tools,
- [01:47] we are connecting agents to our
- [01:49] applications in a standard way. It's
- [01:52] fully open source. So, they have this
- [01:54] GitHub repo, which I'll link to in the
- [01:56] description. They have a nice diagram
- [01:57] here that shows how it works at a high
- [01:59] level as well. So we have AGUI kind of
- [02:02] as a middleman here that provides a
- [02:04] standard of communication between our
- [02:06] front-end applications and our AI
- [02:09] agents. And so as long as both have
- [02:12] support for AGUI, which all of these AI
- [02:15] agent frameworks do, then we have this
- [02:18] seamless communication that makes it so
- [02:19] we can build full applications in
- [02:21] hundreds of lines of code instead of
- [02:23] thousands and thousands. And that's what
- [02:25] we'll see as we build together and go
- [02:27] through some of these demos. And so we
- [02:29] just have to pick our front-end library
- [02:31] and our AI agent framework. And then
- [02:33] AGUI takes care of a lot of things. And
- [02:36] so for our front end, we're going to be
- [02:38] using Copilot Kit. This is a React
- [02:40] library that makes it very easy for us
- [02:42] to build userfacing agentic
- [02:45] applications. It integrates natively
- [02:46] with AGUI, of course. And then out of
- [02:49] all the options we have for our AI agent
- [02:52] framework, you know, if you've been
- [02:53] following my channel that paid AI is my
- [02:56] favorite. And they recently added a
- [02:58] direct firstparty integration between
- [03:01] Copilot Kit and Pineanti through AGUI.
- [03:04] They even have an AGUI doc section in
- [03:06] Pideant AAI. So, I'm super excited for
- [03:08] this. This is actually the catalyst for
- [03:10] me to make this video and I've been
- [03:12] talking to the Copilot Kit team about
- [03:14] this and actually asking for this
- [03:15] integration. So, I'm super excited that
- [03:17] it's finally here because now we can
- [03:19] build these kinds of user interactive
- [03:21] applications with Pyantic AI agents
- [03:24] under the hood driving the whole thing.
- [03:26] And these are the demos that they have
- [03:28] for us that I was talking about earlier.
- [03:29] I'll link to this in the description.
- [03:30] It's a great resource to just explore
- [03:33] the power of AGUI. So, they have all of
- [03:36] these different demos that each
- [03:38] represent something that would very much
- [03:41] not be trivial to build without AGUI.
- [03:43] But with AGUI, it's really easy. You can
- [03:46] even see the code for both the front end
- [03:48] like with copilot kit here and the back
- [03:50] end like I have paid ai selected here
- [03:52] but you can even just select any AI
- [03:55] agent framework you want and it'll
- [03:56] immediately drop that in in the back end
- [03:58] and then we have to change nothing in
- [04:00] the front end that's what agui gives us
- [04:03] that standard communication so we can
- [04:05] move from langraph to eggno or eggno to
- [04:07] panty and our front end app doesn't have
- [04:09] to change at all so let's actually see
- [04:11] this in action like I want you to see
- [04:13] how this really does unlock a entic
- [04:15] experiences for us. Like in this example
- [04:18] right here, it is a recipe builder and
- [04:20] there's a state sync between our front
- [04:23] end and our backend thanks to AGUI. So
- [04:26] like for example, I can add an
- [04:27] ingredient here and I can say I'm adding
- [04:29] in beef, one pound of beef. And then I
- [04:31] can ask my agent, what are my
- [04:33] ingredients? And it's going to
- [04:35] immediately recognize the changes that I
- [04:37] made in the front end here because we
- [04:39] have that two-way sync. There we go. We
- [04:41] got our ingredients. And then I can do
- [04:43] the other way around. And I can say I
- [04:46] want to make a recipe with a lot of
- [04:49] beef. All right. So now instead of
- [04:51] syncing the front end to the the backend
- [04:52] agent, it's now the agent that's going
- [04:54] to be updating our front end here. So
- [04:56] it's creating the recipe and boom, it
- [04:59] renders out everything in a very
- [05:00] beautiful way in the front end. So we
- [05:02] have our typical chat application on the
- [05:04] right hand side, but then it's deeply
- [05:07] integrated into the rest of the
- [05:08] components of our front end. That's what
- [05:10] I mean by aentic experiences. Really,
- [05:12] really nice. We have our instructions
- [05:14] here. We can actually improve it with AI
- [05:17] as well. We have our list of ingredients
- [05:19] and I can continue to collaborate with
- [05:21] the agent here making changes back and
- [05:23] forth to make my perfect recipe. And
- [05:26] obviously it's just a very simple
- [05:27] example here. But yeah, definitely play
- [05:29] around with these different things like
- [05:31] human in the loop collaborating with our
- [05:33] agent toolbased generative UI. So we can
- [05:36] actually build tools in our front end
- [05:37] that we give into our AI agent
- [05:40] dynamically. There's so many powerful
- [05:41] things here. And like I said, we can
- [05:43] view the code. So we can see exactly how
- [05:46] the front end was built with Copilot Kit
- [05:48] and how the back end was built with the
- [05:50] Pantic AI agent. All right, so now that
- [05:52] you know how AGUI works and what it
- [05:54] really gives us, let's get into actually
- [05:56] building with it. So the easiest way to
- [05:58] get started with building these Aente
- [06:00] experiences with AGUI is to follow this
- [06:03] quick start, which I'll link to in the
- [06:04] description. And so this is the copilot
- [06:07] kit documentation and they have an
- [06:08] entire section for working with
- [06:10] paidantic AI specifically and they do
- [06:13] that for all of their integrations. It's
- [06:15] really really cool. And so to get
- [06:17] started we just have to have mpm
- [06:19] installed on our machine and we can copy
- [06:21] this command here. So I'll actually go
- [06:22] into my terminal and let's walk through
- [06:24] this really quickly. So, it's going to
- [06:26] set up a new project for us using
- [06:28] Copilot Kit as the front end. And then
- [06:30] we're using AGUI here. And we can select
- [06:32] our agent framework. And so, I'll just
- [06:34] say test here because I have something
- [06:36] else set up already that I'll demo for
- [06:37] you. And there we go. We can select our
- [06:39] framework. Like I can say I want to use
- [06:41] Pinantic AI. There we go. And so, it's
- [06:43] going to open up your browser for
- [06:45] authentication because there is a cloud
- [06:47] version of Copilot Kit. We don't
- [06:49] actually have to pay for anything
- [06:51] though. Um, and so we can just get
- [06:53] through this and authenticate and then
- [06:54] I'll come back once I have this done.
- [06:56] Okay, there we go. So, I'm signed in. It
- [06:58] creates a Copilot kit cloud API key as
- [07:01] well if you want to host with them. You
- [07:03] don't have to though. And so, for
- [07:04] demonstration purposes, we're not going
- [07:06] to be doing anything with that right
- [07:07] now, but yeah, they even give us some
- [07:09] documentation here. And so, we can open
- [07:11] this new folder that was created for us.
- [07:13] And so, I have it open right now. And
- [07:15] then there's a readme here that walks
- [07:17] you through the quick start. So, how you
- [07:18] can get things set up in both the front
- [07:20] end and the back end. And it's literally
- [07:22] just a couple of commands. Like, it's so
- [07:24] easy to get this up and running. And
- [07:26] that's going to give us a quick start
- [07:29] that's going to look kind of like the
- [07:30] demos that we saw here. But now we have
- [07:33] something that is running entirely
- [07:34] locally. And there's a couple of
- [07:36] different things we can try to really
- [07:38] see the power of AGUI. And we can start
- [07:40] to build on top of this application as
- [07:42] well. But I'll just show you really
- [07:43] quickly. Like for example, I can say set
- [07:45] the theme to green. And so this is a
- [07:48] tool that we actually build in the front
- [07:50] end and send into our agent. So our
- [07:53] backend agent, thanks to AGUI, doesn't
- [07:56] even have to know that there's a tool to
- [07:58] change the theme. And we just pass that
- [07:59] in from the front end. I can also say
- [08:02] write a proverb about the difficulties
- [08:06] of SQL. All right. So we'll send this
- [08:08] in. It'll make a proverb for us. And
- [08:09] then boom, we immediately have that
- [08:11] state sync like that other demo I was
- [08:13] showing you where now our front end has
- [08:15] this proverb here. And it's displayed
- [08:17] and rendered out in a nice rain. I can
- [08:18] say write another one. And so we can do
- [08:21] another state sync here. And then I can
- [08:23] delete one of these as well. Like I'll
- [08:25] just delete this first one. And I'll say
- [08:26] I deleted one which is left. Right? So
- [08:30] we can know that the front end is also
- [08:31] syncing back to the back end as well.
- [08:34] And then the last thing that they have
- [08:36] for the demo here. I'm just trying to
- [08:37] like show you the different kinds of
- [08:39] things that we can do with this front
- [08:40] end. It's really, really neat. We can
- [08:42] also render out components in our chat
- [08:44] UI. So, we're not limited to just having
- [08:46] a bland conversation here and then
- [08:49] passing things into the rest of our app.
- [08:50] We can also render out cool things here.
- [08:52] So, I can say, uh, what is the weather
- [08:54] in Orlando, Florida? And it's going to
- [08:57] render out a really nice looking card
- [08:59] here. So we can take tool calls from the
- [09:01] back end and standardize the format like
- [09:04] actually make it look like a nice
- [09:05] component in our React frontend. So
- [09:08] super cool. That's what we have for our
- [09:09] quick demo here. But now let's actually
- [09:12] use this as a starting point to build
- [09:14] our own applications on top. Now to
- [09:17] build on top of this application, we're
- [09:19] not going to dive straight into
- [09:21] implementation. There's one really cool
- [09:23] thing first because the co-pilot kit
- [09:25] team, they have built a vibe coding MCP
- [09:29] server. Now, you know that I'm not the
- [09:31] biggest fan of vibe coding. So, maybe
- [09:32] this isn't the best name for what I'm
- [09:34] about to use it for, but this is an MCP
- [09:36] server that's kind of like archon for
- [09:39] knowledge retrieval. It gives our AI
- [09:41] coding assistant the ability to search
- [09:44] through the co-pilot kit and AGUI
- [09:47] documentation and best practices. So it
- [09:50] becomes our expert guide on our
- [09:52] implementation. Super cool. So if you're
- [09:54] building any kind of agentic experiences
- [09:56] with this tech stack, definitely use
- [09:58] this MCP server. That's what I'm going
- [10:00] to be using right now. And they have
- [10:02] instructions here based on your AI
- [10:04] coding assistant like cursor or client
- [10:05] or windsurf exactly how to hook it up.
- [10:08] Now they don't have instructions here
- [10:10] for claude code specifically. Uh but
- [10:12] I've got that for you right now. So you
- [10:14] can copy this URL right here and then go
- [10:16] into your editor. I have my terminal
- [10:19] open here and I'll just paste the
- [10:21] command right here. So it's claude MCP
- [10:23] ad and then SSE is their transport and
- [10:26] then you just can call this server
- [10:28] whatever you want and then the SSE URL
- [10:30] is the one that we copied from the
- [10:32] documentation. So I'll add that in here
- [10:34] and then I can also do a claude MCP list
- [10:37] to test the connection and so this is a
- [10:40] remote MCP server completely free to
- [10:42] use. Now Claude Code is able to search
- [10:45] the C-pilot kit documentation. Super
- [10:47] cool. Okay, so now armed with this MCP
- [10:49] server, we can now build any kind of
- [10:52] agentic experience that we want on top
- [10:54] of this starter template. It provides a
- [10:56] really good foundation for us. And so
- [10:58] yeah, I'll send in a request here. I'll
- [11:00] show you what it looks like to build on
- [11:02] top. And then I'll even show you how far
- [11:05] I went taking a rag AI agent that I
- [11:08] built with Padantic AI on my channel
- [11:09] previously and I'll show you how I built
- [11:12] a full application around it with a GUI.
- [11:14] So, we'll get there in a second, but
- [11:15] right now I just want to send in a
- [11:17] simple request here. I'll and first I'll
- [11:19] actually tell it to use the uh copilot
- [11:22] kit MCP server to understand how to
- [11:25] build this feature. And maybe I don't
- [11:28] have to call that out explicitly, but I
- [11:29] just want to to make sure that it
- [11:31] leverages the MCP. So, what I want to do
- [11:33] here, if I go within the source and
- [11:36] page.tsx,
- [11:38] one of the things we have here is the
- [11:40] co-pilot kit action. This is our
- [11:43] front-end tool that we're passing into
- [11:45] our agent to give it the ability to
- [11:47] change the theme. And so I want to add
- [11:50] another tool here to do something else.
- [11:53] Let's say maybe clear all the proverbs
- [11:55] that we have on the front end. I think
- [11:56] that's a good example here. So I'll say
- [11:58] I want to make another uh front-end tool
- [12:03] with co-pilot kit to clear the proverbs
- [12:08] that we currently have. And so we since
- [12:10] we have that state sync as well, the
- [12:12] agent will immediately recognize that
- [12:14] everything is cleared in the front end.
- [12:16] And so I'm going to go ahead and send
- [12:17] this in right now. And it should after
- [12:20] maybe looking at some of the files we
- [12:21] have in um our starter template here or
- [12:24] actually yeah right away it searches the
- [12:26] copilot kit docs. Take a look at that.
- [12:28] Use copilot kit action custom actions
- [12:30] front end. And we can do control O to
- [12:33] expand and actually see the chunks or
- [12:35] the snippets as they call them that were
- [12:37] retrieved from this rag implementation.
- [12:39] It's really, really cool. So, we're
- [12:41] pulling in the documentation from
- [12:42] C-pilot kit. That's a part of our
- [12:44] context engineering here, giving our
- [12:47] coding assistant all the information it
- [12:49] needs to actually build out the
- [12:51] implementation here. Now, this is a very
- [12:53] simple example. And so, it could
- [12:55] probably just look at what we already
- [12:57] have for a front-end tool and then
- [12:58] implement that as well. But I hope that
- [13:00] you can see that like if we didn't have
- [13:02] any front-end tools at all, it would
- [13:04] have no idea how to use use copilot kit
- [13:07] action. So, it would need to search
- [13:08] through the documentation like we are
- [13:10] doing here. And so, yeah, let me
- [13:12] actually scroll down. Um, let me exit
- [13:14] out of this. There we go. All right.
- [13:16] Yeah, there we go. It is adding in a
- [13:17] clear all proverb tool. And so, when
- [13:20] this is invoked from our agent, it's
- [13:23] going to yeah, just clear the proverbs
- [13:25] in the state that we have and that'll
- [13:26] immediately be synced to the backend as
- [13:29] well. Looking really, really nice. So,
- [13:30] cool. Yeah, I'll pause and come back
- [13:32] once this is fully fully implemented.
- [13:34] There we go. I just paused for like 20
- [13:36] seconds and then we are done. So we have
- [13:39] that new action and then we just have
- [13:41] the button that it added for us to be
- [13:43] able to clear things right here. So
- [13:45] there we go. We got our updated UI. So
- [13:46] now I can say add a bunch of proverbs.
- [13:50] All right. So we'll have to populate it
- [13:51] first obviously. So the agent has
- [13:53] generated some proverbs. There we go. We
- [13:55] have Oh wow. It is adding a lot. All
- [13:56] right. So we added a lot of proverbs
- [13:58] here. And now I can clear all of them.
- [14:00] And so I'm going to send this in. Click
- [14:03] this button here. Or I could just ask it
- [14:05] to clear the proverbs. So, well, I'm
- [14:06] actually going to click this button
- [14:07] here, clear all proverbs. Uh, there we
- [14:09] go. And now we have that state sync. And
- [14:11] so, I can say, what proverbs do I have?
- [14:15] And it's going to say that there are
- [14:17] none. There we go. It is currently
- [14:19] empty. And I can also show you. So, I'm
- [14:21] going to say add some more. I'll also
- [14:23] show you that like I can have the agent
- [14:24] clear them as well. So, it doesn't just
- [14:26] have to be this button. So, I can say
- [14:28] clear the proverbs. And so just based on
- [14:30] a simple text request to our agent, we
- [14:32] can do the same thing that that button
- [14:34] did. And so I hope that this just helps
- [14:36] you see how our agent is starting to
- [14:39] interact with the website. We can build
- [14:40] these agentic experiences where AI
- [14:43] agents can actually help us navigate
- [14:45] through a website as well. Like this is
- [14:46] a really simple example where it
- [14:48] performs an action of a button click,
- [14:50] but this could be a full onboarding
- [14:52] experience where the agent is actually
- [14:54] like walking me through clicking on
- [14:56] different buttons in my app depending on
- [14:58] what I'm talking to it about. Like, oh,
- [15:00] I have this question and then it's like,
- [15:01] okay, well, let me click on this button
- [15:03] and then highlight this section of a
- [15:04] website. Like, there's just so many
- [15:05] things that we can do with this. And so,
- [15:07] that that's like the higher level
- [15:09] principles that I wanted to be speaking
- [15:10] to in this video. Like it's cool to like
- [15:13] see AGUI and Pantic AI specifically, but
- [15:16] like the most important thing that I'm
- [15:18] trying to get across here is the general
- [15:20] principles of like we need a way to sync
- [15:22] the state between the front end and the
- [15:25] back end. The agent needs to know like
- [15:26] where we're currently at in our front
- [15:28] end. And that is what AGUI makes really
- [15:31] easy for us along with the fact of
- [15:33] course that our backend is so incredibly
- [15:36] simple thanks to AGUI. Generally, you'd
- [15:39] have to build an entire backend with API
- [15:41] endpoints and middleware and everything.
- [15:43] But our backend right now is literally
- [15:45] just a single file. We have our
- [15:47] agent.py. And so this is our Pantic AI
- [15:50] agent where we have our agent defined.
- [15:52] We're giving it some tools. It's going
- [15:53] to look very similar for uh other
- [15:56] frameworks as well. We have our primary
- [15:58] system prompt. And then the only thing
- [16:00] we have to do to turn this padantic AI
- [16:03] agent into a fully working API endpoint
- [16:06] compatible with AGUI and our C-pilot kit
- [16:08] front end is to call this two AGUI
- [16:11] function. So so easy. And so now our
- [16:13] agent is running on port 8000 and it is
- [16:16] good to go. And we have everything
- [16:17] handled here with the state syncing and
- [16:19] conversation history. We can even
- [16:21] dynamically adjust the system prompt
- [16:23] based on the front end. There's so much
- [16:24] integration that we have here for
- [16:26] literally 100 lines of code. like this
- [16:28] is just so so easy. And so there are a
- [16:31] lot of things that are made possible
- [16:32] thanks to AGUI. Not because we couldn't
- [16:35] build it without the protocol, but
- [16:37] because it just makes it so easy to do
- [16:39] so. And it's the same kind of thing with
- [16:41] like the model context protocol. I mean,
- [16:43] we can connect agents to any tools, but
- [16:45] MCP just makes it very easy and
- [16:47] accessible. That's what we have here.
- [16:49] And like I said I would cover, I even
- [16:51] went as far as to take an existing
- [16:54] Pantic AI agent that I built on my
- [16:56] channel previously and create a full
- [16:58] application around it with AGUI and
- [17:00] Copilot Kit. And that's what you're
- [17:02] looking at right here. And so I'll link
- [17:04] to the video right here where I built
- [17:05] this rag agent. I built it with cloud
- [17:07] code and a team of sub agents. And in
- [17:09] that video we were just using the
- [17:11] command line, a simple CLI tool to talk
- [17:13] to our agent. So it was a perfect
- [17:15] opportunity to take an existing agent
- [17:18] and barely having to change the code at
- [17:20] all thanks to the podantic AI and AGUI
- [17:22] integration to build out this full app.
- [17:24] And so now I can ask it a question. It's
- [17:26] a rag agent. So we have this knowledge
- [17:28] base with all this information about AI
- [17:30] startup. So I can ask it about OpenAI's
- [17:32] funding for example. And we'll get the
- [17:34] answer on the right hand side like a
- [17:35] normal chatbot. It's got streaming and
- [17:37] conversation history and everything. But
- [17:39] then also it takes all of the chunks
- [17:42] that we returned from the knowledge base
- [17:44] and it populates the front end with
- [17:46] them. So we have this super interactive
- [17:48] rag agent where we can actually like
- [17:49] view the chunks that it retrieved. We
- [17:51] can see the match percentage. We can
- [17:53] click into view the contents of the
- [17:55] chunks and all the metadata like the
- [17:57] document that it came from. I mean this
- [17:59] is definitely taking a typical rag agent
- [18:01] that you would have in just a chat
- [18:03] interface. taking it to the next level
- [18:05] where we can actually see under the hood
- [18:07] what information it's using to give us
- [18:09] the answer that we have in the chat box.
- [18:11] So really really cool and man was it
- [18:14] easy to build this out. I'll just show
- [18:16] you the code really quickly here. I had
- [18:18] to define some classes here. That's for
- [18:20] the state sync so that the chunks that
- [18:22] we have in the front end is synced with
- [18:23] what the agent knows it's displaying.
- [18:26] And then I defined my agent very very
- [18:28] much the same way like I always do with
- [18:30] padantic AI giving it tools as well to
- [18:32] search my knowledge base both with
- [18:34] semantic search and hybrid search like a
- [18:37] keyword search. And so I'll scroll down
- [18:39] here. We have the system prompt as well.
- [18:42] Um this is also dynamic. So all of the
- [18:44] chunks that we have as a part of that
- [18:46] state sync through agui we're passing
- [18:48] those in as a part of the system prompt.
- [18:50] And then all I have to do just like our
- [18:52] starter template is call the rag agent.2
- [18:55] to agui and now we have the full backend
- [18:58] infrastructure spun up with the agent
- [19:00] running on a port 8000. Absolutely
- [19:02] beautiful. And we could swap this out
- [19:04] for a langraph agent and not even have
- [19:06] to change the front end at all. That is
- [19:08] the beauty of AGUI. And to build all of
- [19:12] this, all I did is I followed the quick
- [19:13] start here in the copilot kit
- [19:15] documentation for Pantic AI. They have
- [19:18] instructions specifically for how you
- [19:20] can take an existing Pantic AI agent and
- [19:23] turn it into something that's compatible
- [19:24] with AGUI. So I I use this as a
- [19:26] reference point. And then I went into
- [19:28] Cloud Code. I took that starter template
- [19:31] that I already showed you building on
- [19:32] top of, put in the code for my existing
- [19:35] agent, hooked in the vibe coding MCP
- [19:38] server and just had it go ham. So yeah,
- [19:41] using the MCP for documentation and then
- [19:43] the existing template to build on top
- [19:44] of, I just told it exactly what I
- [19:46] wanted. I want you to take the copilot
- [19:48] kit application, make it work with this
- [19:50] rag agent so I can actually see the
- [19:52] chunks and all the metadata and it
- [19:53] knocked it out of the park. It was so
- [19:55] easy to build this out. So there you
- [19:57] have it. That is everything you need to
- [19:59] know to get started building agentic
- [20:01] experiences with AGUI. Now here's the
- [20:04] thing. Pyantic AI, AGUI, Copilot Kit,
- [20:07] these are just tools to get the job
- [20:09] done. The higher level principles are
- [20:11] what I really want you to focus on.
- [20:13] things that I covered here like human in
- [20:15] the loop and front-end tools and state
- [20:16] syncing. That's what you really need to
- [20:18] make these agentic experiences. AGUI is
- [20:22] just the protocol to standardize things
- [20:24] and make it that much easier to build
- [20:26] out this kind of application. Like I
- [20:28] literally built this out in like a half
- [20:30] hour after I brought in my existing
- [20:31] agent. It was so easy to do this with
- [20:33] the help of an AI coding assistant. So
- [20:36] there you go. If you appreciated this
- [20:38] video and you're looking forward to more
- [20:39] things AI agents and AI coding, I would
- [20:42] really appreciate a like and a
- [20:43] subscribe.
