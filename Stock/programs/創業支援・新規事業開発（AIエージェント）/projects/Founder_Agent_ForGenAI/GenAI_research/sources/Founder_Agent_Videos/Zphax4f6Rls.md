- [00:03] This isn't a person playing a video
- [00:05] game. [music] It's Simma 2,
- [00:10] our most capable AI agent for virtual
- [00:12] worlds.
- [00:14] Worlds that are complex, responsive, and
- [00:17] ever changing, just like [music] ours.
- [00:21] Unlike earlier models, Simitu goes
- [00:24] beyond simple actions to navigate and
- [00:26] complete difficult multi-step tasks.
- [00:29] >> [music]
- [00:31] >> It understands multimodal prompts
- [00:36] and if you ask, Simatu will explain
- [00:39] [music] what it can see and what it
- [00:41] plans to do next.
- [00:44] Simitu can learn,
- [00:48] reason, and improve
- [00:53] by playing on its own.
- [00:56] developing new skills and abilities
- [00:58] without any human input.
- [01:01] And the more Simma 2 plays,
- [01:05] the better it becomes.
- [01:09] Taking what it learns in one virtual
- [01:10] world and applying it to the next and
- [01:13] the next and the next,
- [01:17] even if it's never seen them before.
- [01:21] Simma 2, not just a milestone for
- [01:23] training agents in virtual worlds. but a
- [01:26] step towards creating AI that can help
- [01:27] with any task anywhere, including one
- [01:31] day in the real world.
