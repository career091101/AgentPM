- [00:00] I'm really excited about this next
- [00:02] fireside chat. It's guaranteed to be an
- [00:04] A+ conversation about the anatomy of an
- [00:06] agent in enterprisegrade autonomy. I'm
- [00:09] so happy to introduce Scott with
- [00:11] Anthropic and Venturebeat's own Michael
- [00:14] who is also the author of the AGI weekly
- [00:17] newsletter. Make sure you subscribe to
- [00:18] that. Thank you. Uh good afternoon
- [00:21] everyone. Uh my name is Michael Nunees.
- [00:23] I'm the editorial director of
- [00:25] Venturebeat and I'm thrilled to welcome
- [00:27] Scott White, product lead for Claude AI
- [00:29] at Anthropic. Um Scott is at the
- [00:31] forefront of transforming how we think
- [00:33] about AI, not just as a tool that
- [00:35] answers questions, but as a true virtual
- [00:37] collaborator that can work alongside
- [00:39] teams for hours at a time. Um he's been
- [00:41] instrumental in developing Cloud 4,
- [00:43] which was recently released. And uh it,
- [00:45] you know, that model also achieved a
- [00:47] remarkable 72.5% on the SWE coding
- [00:51] benchmark. Everyone, please welcome
- [00:53] Scott to the stage.
- [00:56] Hi everyone. Thanks for having me. Um,
- [00:58] so Scott, you know, I'd love to start
- [00:59] this conversation with just sort of the
- [01:01] evolution of these models and sort of
- [01:03] where we are now. I know it's been a big
- [01:05] couple of weeks. We were just talking
- [01:06] about that backstage. Um, you know, a
- [01:08] year ago we were all really excited
- [01:10] about how chat bots could write emails.
- [01:12] Now we're talking about how AI can code
- [01:14] for seven hours straight. help us
- [01:16] understand this journey and sort of
- [01:18] what's fundamentally changed in how we
- [01:19] think about AI assistants becoming
- [01:21] actual collaborators. Yeah, absolutely.
- [01:24] So, uh it's fun. My experience at
- [01:27] Anthropic is kind of uh tracking the
- [01:30] evolution of these models over the last
- [01:32] couple years and how inexurably
- [01:35] intertwined the product experience and
- [01:37] what is unlocked in terms of
- [01:39] applications are with the models and
- [01:41] their capabilities. So, if I reflect
- [01:43] back to when I started, it was uh the
- [01:47] Cloud 2 family of models. And what we
- [01:49] really built was a a box that allowed
- [01:52] you to have access to a model. Um, and I
- [01:55] think coding is actually the best sort
- [01:58] of uh use case to think about and track
- [02:01] what this evolution looked like. You
- [02:02] know, a year ago, um, or maybe over a
- [02:04] year ago, a little over, the main way
- [02:07] that uh, coding was adopted was through
- [02:09] autocomplete in an IDE. So very much
- [02:12] like where people were already working
- [02:14] very local to what they were doing in a
- [02:16] small context and it would complete the
- [02:18] line that you're at. That's what the
- [02:19] model was capable of. Uh and so that's
- [02:21] how it was integrated into the tools
- [02:23] that people were using. And then if you
- [02:25] fast forward like 6 months after I
- [02:27] started or something, the models 35
- [02:30] sonnet released and it was now capable
- [02:31] of writing entire functions or mini
- [02:34] applications. And the exciting thing was
- [02:36] that that unlocked new product surface
- [02:38] areas that we could take advantage of
- [02:40] that intelligence. And so we launched
- [02:42] artifacts basically a year and a little
- [02:44] bit ago in June last year. Uh and that
- [02:46] took advantage of the fact that claude
- [02:48] could write an entire you know
- [02:50] application I mean the application
- [02:52] bespoke user interface for users to do
- [02:54] things with claude and we could only
- [02:56] launch that because the model was now
- [02:57] good enough at writing code to unlock
- [02:59] that new product feature. Now you fast
- [03:02] forward you know to uh a couple months
- [03:04] ago we launched cloud 4. We launch it
- [03:06] alongside cloud code which is now a
- [03:09] fully sort of remote agentic software
- [03:12] engineer right uh and it is the kind of
- [03:15] thing that the things that mattered a
- [03:18] year ago when you have autocomplete in
- [03:20] an IDE latency that doesn't matter as
- [03:22] much because you're now delegating tasks
- [03:25] to a virtual software engineering agent
- [03:28] that is asynchronously going off and
- [03:30] doing a bunch of work writing a bunch of
- [03:32] code analyzing an entire codebase maybe
- [03:35] searching the internet to find API
- [03:37] documentation for you to then use to
- [03:39] make those changes. You know, issuing a
- [03:41] pull request and then you know actually
- [03:43] getting comments from people on the pull
- [03:46] request, taking those comments and then
- [03:48] iterating on the code based on those
- [03:49] comments. That is like an entire agentic
- [03:51] process in the background that was not
- [03:54] possible 6 months ago. Uh and that
- [03:57] product now is only possible because of
- [04:00] the intelligence of the model. And so
- [04:02] that's the dynamic that's been like
- [04:04] interesting for me to adjust to and see
- [04:06] is when you are developing the model
- [04:08] entire new products become possible and
- [04:11] you only see that early when you're
- [04:13] building that model and then you can
- [04:14] build those products that take full
- [04:16] advantage of the intelligence and if I
- [04:18] think about like what the key things
- [04:20] that unlocked that evolution over the
- [04:21] last year one is model intelligence two
- [04:24] is tools and the model accessing those
- [04:28] tools and being able to use those tools
- [04:30] with that intellig igence tools like web
- [04:33] search, tools like editing code bases,
- [04:35] tools like uh the model context protocol
- [04:37] and integrating with various systems and
- [04:39] then lastly is like the product surfaces
- [04:42] that take advantage of tools and the
- [04:44] model intelligence and the sort of like
- [04:47] collection of those three things working
- [04:49] together I feel like is the you can see
- [04:52] the shape of like chatbot to agents by
- [04:55] virtue of those things being deployed
- [04:57] and delivered together. Um awesome. you
- [04:58] know, I'd love to um just kind of double
- [05:00] click on that for a second. You know, um
- [05:02] you know, you mentioned model
- [05:03] intelligence and specifically um
- [05:05] function calling being kind of a big uh
- [05:08] element, I guess, of of what's possible
- [05:09] with Claude with code. Can we um maybe,
- [05:12] you know, help people understand or even
- [05:15] just get started? You know, we were
- [05:16] talking about this backstage as well.
- [05:18] You know, agents are super exciting, but
- [05:20] they can be a little bit overwhelming
- [05:21] for uh people that want to just get
- [05:24] involved. um you know tell us a little
- [05:26] bit about sort of you know what these
- [05:28] terms are are first of all agent
- [05:30] workflow LLM with tools and just how
- [05:32] people can get started with um with
- [05:35] cloud code you know cloud code yeah
- [05:37] absolutely so uh if I think about
- [05:40] breaking down a few of these components
- [05:42] the first one is just the large language
- [05:45] model right claude you go to cloud.ai AI
- [05:47] and you can speak to claude. You can ask
- [05:49] it a question, issue it a query. It will
- [05:51] take that it will use its reasoning
- [05:53] model and then it will provide a
- [05:54] response to you. Then on top of that you
- [05:57] add tools. So a model with tools might
- [06:00] be uh a you know clawed with web search
- [06:03] and I might ask it what's the weather in
- [06:04] San Francisco today. The model itself
- [06:07] doesn't know the weather in San
- [06:08] Francisco. It's a pre-trained and
- [06:09] fine-tuned model that doesn't have the
- [06:11] weather today in its you know knowledge
- [06:13] base but it can use the tool. And so I
- [06:15] ask it that question. It uses the tool.
- [06:18] It reasons about the response and then
- [06:19] it gives me the weather. The next thing
- [06:21] is a workflow which I think of as a
- [06:24] deterministic process that probably an
- [06:27] engineer will be building or someone
- [06:29] might be building within a product at
- [06:30] their company. But the idea is you want
- [06:32] like a very deterministic outcome. Like
- [06:34] if you're running payroll at a company,
- [06:36] you don't want that to be
- [06:37] non-deterministic. You want that to be
- [06:39] on on rails. But you still might have
- [06:41] Claude in the loop to do something like
- [06:44] take a physical piece of paper, extract
- [06:46] key values and then like plug them into
- [06:49] that deterministic process. So it's like
- [06:51] logic gates and a very defined outcome.
- [06:54] The last thing though is agents are not
- [06:57] necessarily workflows. They might have a
- [06:58] workflow within it, but I think about an
- [07:00] agent as something that has a goal and
- [07:03] then it can just do many things to
- [07:06] accomplish that goal. And it can iterate
- [07:08] over tools over an environment, getting
- [07:11] customer feedback or user feedback. But
- [07:13] really it's a a sort of
- [07:15] non-deterministic or quasi deterministic
- [07:17] process where it's getting information
- [07:20] reasoning over the information it has
- [07:22] deciding to do more things uh and then
- [07:25] ultimately iterating until it feels like
- [07:26] it's accomplished that goal. So that's
- [07:28] how I sort of break down the components
- [07:30] and I think again it tracks model
- [07:32] intelligence where like a year ago the
- [07:34] model was only intelligent enough to
- [07:36] answer a question and maybe use one or
- [07:38] two tools to answer that question. Then
- [07:40] the model became intelligent and people
- [07:41] had enough tools to implement the model
- [07:44] into structured workflows within their
- [07:45] business. And then only once the model
- [07:47] became intelligent enough can it
- [07:49] actually reason over a large number of
- [07:51] tools that it needs to use to iterate
- [07:54] over and over and over to then get to an
- [07:55] outcome. So I think we're now in a place
- [07:58] where agents are not only like
- [08:01] components of the applications that
- [08:02] people are building but also entire
- [08:04] applications themselves uh and agents
- [08:06] working with other agents. And so again,
- [08:08] model intelligence and the tools that it
- [08:10] has unlocks these new sort of uh
- [08:13] paradigms. Um, you know, I've seen a
- [08:15] really great uh sort of representation
- [08:17] of this called Way of the Code by Rick
- [08:20] Rubin, who's this um worldclass music
- [08:22] producer. He's worked with Johnny Cash
- [08:24] and the Beasty Boys and Outcast and a
- [08:26] million other artists, I think Bruce
- [08:28] Springsteen among um among others. um
- [08:31] you know that is a really cool example I
- [08:34] think of what is possible with cloud
- [08:35] code but I know you're working with a
- [08:36] lot of big companies as well can you
- [08:38] tell us maybe about some projects or
- [08:40] real world examples of people actually
- [08:42] putting this stuff to use or um you know
- [08:45] deploying this in at the enterprise
- [08:46] level yeah absolutely um so I think like
- [08:50] there are examples of customers that are
- [08:52] taking cloud and implementing it into
- [08:54] workflows that are either ad hoc or very
- [08:56] structured I think of like a company
- [08:58] like Novo Nordisk is creating these
- [09:00] these sort of clinical reports that used
- [09:02] to take I think like 10 weeks or on the
- [09:04] order of weeks and are now doing it in
- [09:06] like 10 minutes by integrating with a
- [09:08] lot of research and tools internally and
- [09:10] the ROI on something like that is you
- [09:13] know it's orders of magnitude um and but
- [09:16] that it's also companies like GitLab
- [09:18] doing a lot of productivity within their
- [09:21] organization so everything from using
- [09:24] cloud for enterprise to do RFPs for
- [09:26] their sales team or write technical
- [09:28] documentation
- [09:30] or actually you know write the code uh
- [09:33] you know underneath the systems that are
- [09:35] powering GitLab. So these are a variety
- [09:38] of different use cases and and the fun
- [09:40] thing is that we have different
- [09:41] solutions our API and cloud for
- [09:43] enterprise. So you get to see all these
- [09:46] non-technical people building these
- [09:48] early agents for themselves to to solve
- [09:50] problems that are close to their hearts
- [09:52] at work. But you also have engineers
- [09:54] taking these and implementing them into
- [09:56] core business processes at the
- [09:58] organization or building products that
- [10:01] they then give to their end users like
- [10:03] in it uh you know using claude to
- [10:06] provide end users tax advice right
- [10:08] that's something I've actually used as
- [10:09] an end user uh and so it's fun to see
- [10:12] all three of those and I think also
- [10:14] anthropic is customer zero for a lot of
- [10:17] what we're building and it's notable
- [10:18] that I think like 90% of cloud code was
- [10:21] written by cloud mode uh nowadays and I
- [10:25] am a product manager. I am not a
- [10:27] professional software engineer but this
- [10:29] week is our hack week and I am building
- [10:31] like full production features now. Uh
- [10:35] and I no longer think about my job as
- [10:38] writing up PRD and trying to convince
- [10:40] like someone to to do something or
- [10:42] design something. The first thing I do
- [10:44] is can I build a workable prototype of
- [10:47] this on our staging server and then like
- [10:50] share a demo of it actually working get
- [10:52] intuition internally about the feature
- [10:55] whether it feels good whether we have
- [10:57] conviction that we want to ship it and
- [10:59] then ultimately we'll decide from there
- [11:00] whether we want to ship it that's me
- [11:02] changing the way that I think about my
- [11:04] job now because I have access to this
- [11:06] tool and it is now going to land in
- [11:09] production and so that's like we are an
- [11:11] enterprise using our own tool to change
- [11:13] the way that we think about the products
- [11:14] that we're shipping because we have
- [11:16] access to the built that's been super
- [11:18] exciting and fun. Wow. Um you know I
- [11:21] just one more question on um sort of how
- [11:23] you think about building these agents.
- [11:25] Um just any advice for prompt
- [11:27] engineering or how you think about kind
- [11:30] of getting started those initial like
- [11:32] like telling the computer what to do,
- [11:33] telling the the agent what to do. Um any
- [11:36] advice for the audience on just sort of
- [11:38] how to approach that task? keep it
- [11:39] simple, get get detailed, you know,
- [11:41] which do you prefer and and how do you
- [11:43] think about that? Yeah, I think starting
- [11:45] small and incrementally
- [11:48] building up from there. As I think about
- [11:50] even my experience this week building
- [11:52] features with cloud code. It's always
- [11:54] easier to start start with the smallest
- [11:57] thing that you know might work that you
- [12:00] can build upon over time. And so don't
- [12:02] try to build an entire agentic system or
- [12:04] entire agent from from scratch. Build
- [12:07] the component of it. make sure that that
- [12:09] component works then build a next
- [12:11] component that might work with the first
- [12:12] component. So do it sort of iteratively
- [12:14] but ultimately like you know the magic
- [12:17] of these models are that they reason and
- [12:19] can use tools and you can describe to it
- [12:22] the thing that you are trying to do and
- [12:24] it will ultimately do that. So much like
- [12:27] you might go into a meeting with a
- [12:29] collaborator and brainstorm you know the
- [12:32] problem that you're trying to solve you
- [12:33] should treat the model like that thought
- [12:35] partner work on the requirements first
- [12:38] break the requirements down into the
- [12:40] subcomponent pieces and then start
- [12:43] tackling one of those components like
- [12:45] the global context is equally important
- [12:47] for it to understand ultimately what am
- [12:49] I trying to get to but then like
- [12:51] starting local in a small part of it um
- [12:54] that is one component of it the Next
- [12:56] component of it is once you've built it
- [12:58] actually evaluating whether it's worked
- [13:00] and I I like to say sort of internally
- [13:01] sometimes like eval are the new PRD. And
- [13:05] so eval evaluations are just a way of
- [13:08] determining whether the model is doing
- [13:10] what you want it to do. And that's like
- [13:12] a new way of thinking as you're building
- [13:14] agents or as you're building products
- [13:16] that use large language models. You have
- [13:18] to make sure that it's ultimately doing
- [13:19] what you want. If you're not using a
- [13:21] large language model, you can encode
- [13:23] exactly what you want to have happen,
- [13:25] right? It's very deterministic. But once
- [13:27] you introduce that large language model,
- [13:29] it introduces a bit of that
- [13:30] non-determinism. You need a language to
- [13:33] determine whether it is doing well.
- [13:34] Whether that's feedback that you're
- [13:36] collecting from your customers or your
- [13:38] other users internally or whether it's
- [13:40] evaluations, which are just the way of
- [13:42] encoding um what the task is that the
- [13:46] model is trying to do and then grading
- [13:48] it on its ability to do that task. You
- [13:50] mentioned SWEBench that is a well-known
- [13:52] eval for software engineering. But as
- [13:55] things become more sophisticated and as
- [13:57] people build their own agents
- [13:59] internally, they can't just rely on the
- [14:02] benchmarks or evals that exist in the
- [14:04] market, they end up getting more complex
- [14:06] than that and they end up getting more
- [14:08] bespoke to your company. And just like
- [14:10] you have a product that you're trying to
- [14:12] build that is, you know, trying to
- [14:15] deliver a very specific outcome to your
- [14:17] customer, you want your evals to be as
- [14:19] close to that as possible. So if I'm
- [14:21] trying to build a sales transcription
- [14:24] engine or something, I want my evals to
- [14:26] be about sales transcription, not just
- [14:29] you know general intelligence. Sure.
- [14:31] Yeah. And you know we're hearing that
- [14:32] more and more I think about uh a lot of
- [14:34] these evals and sort of the benchmarks
- [14:36] in which we sort of uh I guess uh
- [14:39] evaluate these uh models. You know I
- [14:40] want to make sure we um spend some time
- [14:42] on MCP. you know, so I would say vast
- [14:45] majority of the phone calls I have
- [14:46] during the week, MCP is brought up. Uh,
- [14:49] you know, so a lot of enterprises
- [14:51] interacting with claude seem to lean on
- [14:53] this. Can you kind of explain sort of
- [14:54] what that advantage is for you guys and
- [14:56] and um and maybe for those that are
- [14:58] unfamiliar sort of what MCP is and why
- [15:00] it's so important? Yeah, absolutely. So
- [15:02] MCP stands for the model context
- [15:04] protocol. And I've been talking a bit
- [15:06] about tools and you think about tools as
- [15:09] things that can both do things for you.
- [15:11] So uh if I have a tool that allows the
- [15:14] model to go look at Salesforce and
- [15:16] update a record in Salesforce that is
- [15:19] like a tool that I gave it. Uh but it
- [15:21] also can be used just to retrieve
- [15:22] information. I talked about uh you know
- [15:24] web search as being a tool to retrieve
- [15:26] that information. You might have like a
- [15:29] uh internal knowledge repository of your
- [15:31] documents and you want to build a tool
- [15:32] that allows claude to go and search
- [15:34] those documents. The model context
- [15:36] protocol I think of as like the USBC for
- [15:40] integrations to get more context to
- [15:43] applications that you're building or or
- [15:45] claude um they need all of this context
- [15:47] and they need all of these tools to
- [15:50] build these agents and to build these
- [15:51] workflows and before the model context
- [15:54] protocol uh which is an open protocol
- [15:56] that anthropic pioneered that is that
- [15:58] sort of translation layer between what
- [16:00] the tools are and what the application
- [16:02] that you're trying to build uh to use
- [16:04] those tools is um you would have to
- [16:07] build point-to-point integrations. So if
- [16:09] I wanted to sync in my documents, I
- [16:12] wanted to sync in Salesforce data, I
- [16:13] wanted to sync in uh you know
- [16:16] information from my customer support
- [16:17] repository, I as a company would need to
- [16:20] build an integration between that
- [16:22] knowledge repository and my application
- [16:24] and I would need to build three
- [16:25] different versions of them and then a
- [16:27] different company wanting to do the same
- [16:29] thing would need to go and build three
- [16:30] different versions of those same
- [16:32] integrations for themselves. But now
- [16:34] with remote MCP what you can do is build
- [16:38] uh the connectivity between those three
- [16:41] applications and because it is an open
- [16:43] source protocol now those applications
- [16:46] those tools the prompts underlying how
- [16:49] the integrations should work are now
- [16:51] available for any other company to go
- [16:53] and take and then implement into their
- [16:55] system. So as long as there's an
- [16:57] integration uh you know a remote MCP
- [17:00] integration on the marketplace for you
- [17:03] know Salesforce in your app now someone
- [17:05] else can go and see that find it and say
- [17:06] well I want to use that now and so it's
- [17:08] really democratizing access to data and
- [17:12] that's really really important as these
- [17:14] agents and these systems workflows need
- [17:17] access to valuable context and valuable
- [17:19] tools to do things. it is providing a
- [17:22] sort of sea of information, a sea of
- [17:24] context available to any enterprise to
- [17:26] now build those applications. So, it's
- [17:28] been an incredibly important inflection
- [17:30] point as I talked about earlier like
- [17:32] what are the things that move us from
- [17:35] just a simple chatbot to full agentic
- [17:37] systems. It's model intelligence, tools,
- [17:40] and access to products that wrap all of
- [17:43] those things together. MCP has been an
- [17:45] incredibly important inflection point in
- [17:47] access to tools. Um, awesome, Scott. you
- [17:49] know, just being conscious of time, um,
- [17:51] I'd love to sort of end this
- [17:53] conversation on sort of a
- [17:54] forward-looking um, statement. Can you
- [17:56] tell us a little bit about maybe what
- [17:58] you're most excited about? We've kind of
- [17:59] entered this new era of AI with agents
- [18:02] and, um, autonomous systems that can,
- [18:05] you know, operate for seven hours at a
- [18:06] time. Uh, you know, what's next? And and
- [18:09] I guess, you know, what keeps you up at
- [18:10] night or or sort of, you know, what gets
- [18:12] you excited to wake up and start working
- [18:13] every day? You know, what are those
- [18:14] things that you're really looking
- [18:16] forward to over the next 6 to 12 months?
- [18:18] Yeah, I think if you look at coding as
- [18:21] the early example of early adopters who
- [18:25] have a lot of agency to build the things
- [18:27] that they want to build, I think you can
- [18:29] start to see what the future looks like
- [18:32] by seeing that coding is a little bit
- [18:34] ahead of what the rest of the market
- [18:37] might be ahead on. So you see things
- [18:38] like clawed code get developed and and
- [18:41] sort of shipped that is a full again a
- [18:43] gentic system where you have like a
- [18:46] software engineer running around writing
- [18:48] a bunch of code analyzing the codebase.
- [18:50] The same concepts I don't think have
- [18:53] been deployed to the broader set of
- [18:55] people outside of professional software
- [18:56] engineers yet. And so I'm very excited
- [18:59] for uh both building systems and
- [19:03] building um software to become easier
- [19:06] and more democratized for more people
- [19:07] like me uh who I'm now building those
- [19:10] production features making that more
- [19:12] accessible to people who are not
- [19:14] professional developers. But I think
- [19:15] also taking the same concepts of these
- [19:18] bologentic systems and helping
- [19:21] non-technical people change the way that
- [19:23] they think about their role by being
- [19:25] able to make longer running uh agents
- [19:29] that take the key parts of their process
- [19:31] and allow them to act more as sort of
- [19:33] collaborators or managers of a bunch of
- [19:36] agents helping them do their work and
- [19:39] expanding their professional skill set
- [19:41] beyond where they currently are. I think
- [19:44] that's one thing. I think once you go a
- [19:46] little bit crazier and a little bit
- [19:47] farther out, I think you just start to
- [19:49] see like, well, you're now working with
- [19:51] an agent who's kind of like one, you
- [19:53] know, really capable person that you're
- [19:55] kind of managing. What happens when
- [19:57] you're managing an organization, right?
- [19:59] What happens when you're managing an
- [20:00] organization of agents? Uh, and and how
- [20:03] can everyone be their own mini CPO or
- [20:05] CEO? Uh, and I don't think that's too
- [20:08] far away. Um, and so I I don't exactly
- [20:10] know what that looks like, but that's
- [20:12] the kind of thing that I wake up and I'm
- [20:13] I want to get there. You know, you've
- [20:15] just made me really excited to go start
- [20:17] using this stuff. Um, thank you so much
- [20:19] everyone. Please round of applause for
- [20:20] Scott from Anthropics. Scott White.
- [20:22] Thank you. Thank you.
