- [00:00] NN&N's new instance level MCP is truly a
- [00:02] gamecher and in today's video I'm going
- [00:03] to talk about why that is how easy it is
- [00:05] to use and how to connect it to things
- [00:06] like chatbt claude or lovable and
- [00:09] honestly since MCP or model context
- [00:11] protocol started popping up everywhere
- [00:13] it's been a little bit confusing but
- [00:15] also a buzzword so I wanted to start off
- [00:17] by just making sure we're all on the
- [00:18] same page about what it is and then I'll
- [00:19] show you how to use it [music] so this
- [00:20] is where MCP really started with Neden
- [00:23] where we had an update where you could
- [00:24] make these native MCP server triggers
- [00:27] meaning we could create our own MCP
- [00:29] servers in NN that hooked up to
- [00:31] different tools or different workflows
- [00:32] that we've built. And then we could have
- [00:33] an MCP client like Claude or Cursor
- [00:36] actually talk to these servers and
- [00:38] trigger these workflows or tools. But
- [00:40] with NADN instance level MCP, it's not
- [00:42] just limited to these workflows or tools
- [00:44] that we assign. It's actually letting
- [00:45] our MCP clients search through our
- [00:48] entire NADN instance and look at the
- [00:50] workflows, understand the schemas, what
- [00:52] they do, and actually execute any of
- [00:54] them. Which means right now in your
- [00:56] enident instance, you probably have tons
- [00:57] of workflows that you're like, "Huh, I
- [00:59] would love to just throw this into
- [01:00] lovable or clawed and just have them be
- [01:02] able to use them for me whenever they
- [01:03] want." And now you can. But what does
- [01:06] that really mean? And the easiest way
- [01:07] that I like to think about it is it's
- [01:08] just an AI agent. That's not like the
- [01:10] technical definition, but it's the way I
- [01:12] like to think about it. So right here we
- [01:13] have an an AI agent. And I'm assuming we
- [01:15] all know what we're looking at here,
- [01:16] where the agent has all of these
- [01:18] different tools, and it basically
- [01:20] understands based on the request coming
- [01:21] in, which tool do I need to use? And
- [01:24] when I call that tool, what do I have to
- [01:25] send it? So, picture it as if Chat GBT
- [01:28] is the agent and it can see all of the
- [01:30] different workflows in your instance. It
- [01:31] knows what they do. It knows what to
- [01:32] send it and it knows when to call each
- [01:34] one. So, let's just start plugging in
- [01:36] our NIN to different clients. And before
- [01:38] we do that, I'm going to be doing this
- [01:40] on cloud. You're not limited to doing
- [01:41] this on cloud. You can go ahead to the
- [01:43] NAND MCP docs if you want to be able to
- [01:45] read through a little bit more
- [01:47] information, but you do need to be on
- [01:48] version 1.21.2
- [01:51] or higher. You can see I've got some
- [01:52] workflows right here that have this icon
- [01:54] which basically shows that they're
- [01:55] available for MCP. And if you're on
- [01:57] cloud and you need to update your
- [01:58] instance, you would just do so by going
- [02:00] to your admin panel. So anyways, you're
- [02:02] going to go to your settings in your NIN
- [02:04] and right here you should see MCP
- [02:06] access. And right here what we have is
- [02:08] the ability to connect via OOTH or
- [02:11] access token. Just make sure you
- [02:12] actually enable this and you toggle that
- [02:14] on. So right here you can see that we
- [02:15] are given a server URL and we have zero
- [02:18] connected OOTH clients. So let's go hook
- [02:20] it up. All right, I'm going to start off
- [02:21] with Claude. And I'm not on my Claude
- [02:23] desktop. I'm actually in the cloud
- [02:24] version of Claude right here, which is
- [02:26] super cool that we can just plug it in
- [02:27] right away, super easily. So, what I'm
- [02:28] going to do is I'm going to click on
- [02:30] this little icon right here. And I'm
- [02:32] going to go to add connectors. Now, in
- [02:33] here, you can see that NIDN is already a
- [02:36] native connector right now. So, all I
- [02:38] have to do is click connect, and it's
- [02:40] going to basically open up this OOTH for
- [02:42] us. I'm going to give it access. And
- [02:44] now, we have connected to NADN. Now, if
- [02:45] it's your first time doing this, you
- [02:47] will have to basically just copy in your
- [02:48] server URL and give it to Claude. But
- [02:50] then it's as easy as that. And so now,
- [02:52] if I go to the tools right here, you can
- [02:53] see we're connected to NN and we have
- [02:55] three different options, which are
- [02:56] execute workflow, get workflow details,
- [02:59] or search workflows. So, how many times
- [03:01] have you had an AI help you write an
- [03:03] email? Well, now instead of just writing
- [03:04] it and then copy and pasting it, you can
- [03:06] go ahead and just say, we'll send that
- [03:08] off now. Assuming that you have an edit
- [03:09] in workflow that's available in MCP that
- [03:12] actually sends emails. And you can see
- [03:14] this one is super simple. So now that
- [03:15] that email is written and I like it, I
- [03:17] can basically say use nodn to send that
- [03:19] email to michael@dundermifflin.com.
- [03:21] So what it does is it says let me search
- [03:23] through your available workflows. It
- [03:25] asks you to allow, but I'm just going to
- [03:26] go ahead and do always allow. So after
- [03:28] it searched workflows, it found one and
- [03:30] now it's asking to get workflow details.
- [03:31] So I'm going to always allow this tool
- [03:33] as well. So it grabbed the details. It
- [03:35] knows the three body fields that it
- [03:36] needs and it knows the web hook address
- [03:38] and everything like that. So I'm going
- [03:39] to go ahead and always allow. And we
- [03:40] didn't have to actually go in here and
- [03:42] configure everything with this post
- [03:44] request. Claude was able to just find it
- [03:46] and do it. You can see that we got
- [03:48] confirmation that the email has been
- [03:49] sent. And if I head over to my email,
- [03:51] you can see that it is right here. Okay.
- [03:53] So, let's say I just finished that up
- [03:54] and I have a really busy day. So, I have
- [03:56] my to-do list right here in ClickUp
- [03:58] where I have email Michael about PTO and
- [04:00] that was due today and it's urgent. And
- [04:02] so I could context switch all the way
- [04:03] back into ClickUp or I could just use my
- [04:06] ClickUp task manager AI agent through
- [04:08] MCP and I can talk to this thing in
- [04:10] Claude and I can just ask Claude to do
- [04:11] it because I'm right here and I can say
- [04:13] use N to move my task called email
- [04:15] Michael about PTO to complete. So now
- [04:18] it's going to go ahead and search
- [04:18] through workflows. It found my ClickUp
- [04:20] task manager. It got the details and now
- [04:22] it's going to shoot that off. There you
- [04:24] go. So it says that it finished
- [04:25] everything up and now if I open back up
- [04:26] my ClickUp, we can see that this task
- [04:28] was moved to complete. And now that
- [04:30] that's done, we probably want to see
- [04:31] what else we have to do today. So I'm
- [04:33] going to ask it to use nitn to figure
- [04:34] out what other tasks I have to do today.
- [04:35] So it comes back and says based on what
- [04:37] niten found, you have one task due
- [04:39] today. Record nit mcp video which is
- [04:41] high priority which I'm doing right now.
- [04:43] And as you can see in clickup, that is
- [04:45] the only thing that is due today. Now if
- [04:47] we go into nitn to see what actually
- [04:48] happened here and I'm going to go to my
- [04:50] executions, you can see that on the most
- [04:51] recent execution, the web hook was sent
- [04:54] a body that says what tasks do I have
- [04:56] due today? The agent then go aheads and
- [04:58] process that and it calls its git tasks
- [05:00] tool and then it returns an answer to us
- [05:02] in claude. Now I won't dive into this
- [05:04] actual workflow but it's pretty simple.
- [05:05] We've got three tools update create and
- [05:07] get and then also the system prompt
- [05:09] looks like this in case you guys are
- [05:10] interested in reading through it a
- [05:12] little bit. I'm basically just telling
- [05:13] it what its job is and what tools it has
- [05:15] and when to use each tool. Now there is
- [05:16] something interesting here because in
- [05:18] order to actually update a task it first
- [05:19] has to get them so it knows its ID. So
- [05:21] if you remember the first ClickUp
- [05:23] example from Claude, we basically said
- [05:25] move my task to complete and then you
- [05:27] can see what it did is it got the task
- [05:28] ID and then it went ahead and updated
- [05:30] it. But anyways, there are two important
- [05:32] things that you need to know about
- [05:33] making workflows actually from MCP
- [05:36] clients. The first one is it has to be
- [05:38] an active workflow or a published
- [05:39] workflow. And then second is you have to
- [05:41] go to the settings and then when you get
- [05:43] in there you can see a little toggle
- [05:44] down here that says available in MCP.
- [05:46] Now, this is actually a really good
- [05:48] thing that you have to manually enable
- [05:49] these because otherwise if you had
- [05:51] everything actually give access to your
- [05:53] entire entit instance. There could be
- [05:55] like, you know, some sensitive API keys
- [05:57] or access to certain data in there that
- [05:59] you probably don't want random clients
- [06:00] to have. So, you are in full control
- [06:02] still. And once again, when they're
- [06:04] available in MCP, you can see that right
- [06:05] here. As well as if you go into your
- [06:07] settings and you go to MCP access, you
- [06:09] can see down here what workflows you
- [06:11] actually have available. Now, you will
- [06:13] notice that there's a description. And
- [06:14] for MCP, that's super important that it
- [06:17] can actually look at the description so
- [06:18] it understands the fields to send over
- [06:20] and it can understand what the workflow
- [06:22] does. And the way that you can actually
- [06:23] add the description is, of course, in
- [06:25] the workflow itself. So for this AI
- [06:27] opportunity map generator, I would go
- [06:28] ahead and edit workflow description. And
- [06:30] that's where I put in a few sentences
- [06:32] about what this workflow does. And I
- [06:33] know that I'm using web hooks here, but
- [06:35] what you can do is have any workflow
- [06:37] that has a web hook trigger, a schedule
- [06:39] trigger, a chat trigger, or a form
- [06:41] trigger. These can all work as MCP
- [06:44] workflows. Okay, so before we plug in
- [06:46] this one to lovable and we basically
- [06:48] have it build a full app for us with
- [06:50] just looking at this workflow, I'm going
- [06:52] to show you guys how we can connect to
- [06:53] ChatGBT. So ChatGBT works very similar
- [06:55] to Claude except for there's no native
- [06:57] integration. So what you're going to do
- [06:58] is come down here to your settings.
- [07:00] You're going to go to apps and
- [07:01] connectors and you're going to look
- [07:02] through and you can see that there are
- [07:04] some native integrations. So I imagine
- [07:05] that Enitin will be coming soon. And so
- [07:07] the reason why I wanted to do that Gmail
- [07:09] example was because I think that's a
- [07:10] really common use case. And also the
- [07:12] native connectors for chat and claude,
- [07:14] they don't actually let you send emails.
- [07:15] They just let you find and reference
- [07:17] emails from your inbox. As you can see
- [07:18] in Claude, we only have a Gmail search.
- [07:21] But anyways, what you're going to do is
- [07:22] in order to actually create your own
- [07:24] connection, you just have to come down
- [07:26] to the bottom and turn on developer
- [07:27] mode. Now, this says allows you to add
- [07:29] unverified connectors that could modify
- [07:31] or erase data permanently. Memory is
- [07:33] disabled. and it basically highlights
- [07:35] your chat in orange to let you know that
- [07:37] you are in developer mode. Of course,
- [07:38] there are security concerns. It's just a
- [07:40] very new technology. But once again,
- [07:42] just be careful about which workflows
- [07:43] you're giving access to these different
- [07:45] clients. But now you have the create
- [07:47] button up here in the top right and
- [07:48] you'll go ahead and click on create. And
- [07:50] this is where you would go back into
- [07:51] editn. You would grab the server URL
- [07:53] right here and you would just paste that
- [07:55] right there. So if you remember in
- [07:57] claude when I connected to this MCP
- [07:59] server, it basically did the ooth single
- [08:01] sign on. And so that's exactly what's
- [08:03] going to happen here. And that's why you
- [08:04] will use OOTH authentication. You'll
- [08:06] click on the check mark and then you
- [08:07] will go ahead and click create. But I
- [08:10] want to point out something which is a
- [08:11] little bit unfortunate. This is not
- [08:12] working for me right now. And I don't
- [08:14] think it's working for anyone right now.
- [08:16] I had it going using this exact method.
- [08:18] And I've seen some other tutorials on
- [08:19] YouTube where they are doing it like
- [08:20] this. But I think that chatbt is doing
- [08:22] something right now on their back end.
- [08:24] And I deleted all the connections just
- [08:25] for this video so I could do them live
- [08:27] in front of you guys. So that was kind
- [08:28] of unfortunate. But anyways, I imagine
- [08:30] it will be up and running soon and I
- [08:31] imagine it will be coming natively soon.
- [08:33] But of course, a little workaround is
- [08:35] you could take the oldfashioned way of
- [08:36] using an MCP server trigger in Naden and
- [08:39] then just hooking up the workflows that
- [08:40] you actually want to use in chatbt and
- [08:42] just pasting that in there doing no
- [08:44] authentication and then connecting that
- [08:46] way. As you can see, that gave us a
- [08:48] connector through NIN and I now have
- [08:49] these different actions for different
- [08:51] custom workflows in NIDN. But anyways,
- [08:53] now that we got that out of the way,
- [08:54] let's talk about how we can do this in
- [08:56] lovable. So right here I have an AI
- [08:58] opportunity map generator workflow. And
- [09:00] what I want to do is easily create a
- [09:01] custom frontend that I could send people
- [09:03] to. They could put in a little blurb
- [09:05] about their business and their process
- [09:06] problems and then it would send them an
- [09:08] automated AI road map. So all I would do
- [09:11] is come into NN. I would grab the server
- [09:14] URL right here. Go into lovable and I'll
- [09:16] click on this plus right here. Go to
- [09:17] integrations. Click on manage. Scroll
- [09:19] down a little bit and you can see that
- [09:20] we have N. So I would just have to set
- [09:22] that up and when I hit connect and paste
- [09:24] in my server URL it'll do another single
- [09:27] sign on for us real quick. Just
- [09:28] basically saying that lovable has access
- [09:30] to our end instance and once we click
- [09:32] allow it will basically say that we have
- [09:34] enabled the niten instance MCP in
- [09:37] lovable. So now I can say build me a
- [09:39] minimalistic form submission with a
- [09:40] gamified interface for my nitin workflow
- [09:43] that does AI opportunity mapping. Make
- [09:45] sure to let the user know that their
- [09:46] report is loading after they've sent it
- [09:47] and then give them confirmation when
- [09:48] it's done. So, if you guys have seen a
- [09:50] different lovable video I've done or a
- [09:51] base 44 video I've done, one of the
- [09:53] challenges is actually giving this
- [09:54] interface, the web hook configuration,
- [09:56] the URL, the method, the body to send
- [09:59] over, the body to send back, all of this
- [10:01] kind of stuff. And so, right now, you
- [10:02] can see it's basically just going to
- [10:03] search through my workflows. It's going
- [10:05] to understand what the workflow does,
- [10:06] and it's just going to oneshot a landing
- [10:09] page for us. All right, so that just
- [10:10] finished up. It says, "Discover your AI
- [10:12] automation opportunities. describe any
- [10:14] manual process and receive a
- [10:15] personalized AI automation roadmap with
- [10:17] ROI estimates delivered to your inbox.
- [10:19] So, what's interesting about this is if
- [10:21] you actually came into the workflow and
- [10:22] you looked at like what this is and you
- [10:24] understood like what's going on in the
- [10:26] consultant agent and everything, this is
- [10:28] exactly like pretty spot-on. You
- [10:30] describe, you submit, and you receive.
- [10:31] So, let's go ahead and submit a process
- [10:33] and see what we get. All right, so I put
- [10:35] in a process, I put in my email. I'm
- [10:36] going to click generate my AI
- [10:37] opportunity map. And right now, it is
- [10:40] analyzing all of this. And if I go over
- [10:41] to the workflow and we click on
- [10:43] executions, we should see that it is
- [10:45] currently running. And then we will be
- [10:47] notified over here when that's finished
- [10:48] up. But keep in mind for a oneshot
- [10:50] prompt that was this long. This is
- [10:52] pretty solid. Okay, looks like that just
- [10:54] finished up. It says the report has been
- [10:56] sent to this email. So let's go ahead
- [10:58] and take a look. All right, so here it
- [11:00] is. The landscaping business automation
- [11:01] and efficiency report. We've got an
- [11:03] executive summary. We're diagnosing the
- [11:05] problems in sales operations and field
- [11:07] reporting. We have a root cause analysis
- [11:10] right here. Here's our automation road
- [11:12] map with some quick wins, MVP, two to
- [11:14] four weeks, scalable solution, 1 to 3
- [11:16] months, long-term, and then we've got
- [11:18] some estimated ROI analysis, which right
- [11:21] here you can see total monthly benefit
- [11:22] 20K, 250K almost annual, and just kind
- [11:26] of all of this type of breakdown. So,
- [11:28] the point of this video is not the
- [11:30] actual quality of this road map. It's
- [11:32] more so the fact that we could just tell
- [11:33] Lovable, hey, make me a landing page for
- [11:35] this random workflow in my Naden
- [11:36] instance. and it comes up with something
- [11:38] that I think is pretty solid. Anyways,
- [11:40] just wanted to quickly wrap up here with
- [11:42] how to think about maybe like when you
- [11:43] should use the MCP server. I think a lot
- [11:46] of people might just kind of want to use
- [11:47] some of this technology for certain
- [11:49] things where it doesn't actually really
- [11:50] save time. So, think about interfaces
- [11:52] that you are in a lot. If you're in
- [11:53] cloud a lot, then probably does make
- [11:55] sense to integrate some of your edit
- [11:57] workflows in there that could do things
- [11:58] like, you know, moving files around in
- [12:00] Google Drive or creating tasks or
- [12:02] messaging your team, whatever it is.
- [12:03] Now, something that I think is going to
- [12:04] be really cool is when we're able to
- [12:06] connect our instance level MCP to
- [12:09] something like Vappy or voice providers.
- [12:11] And maybe we already can, but when I was
- [12:12] playing around with it, I actually ended
- [12:14] up doing a different solution where I
- [12:15] just did the regular server trigger,
- [12:17] which is kind of the workflow you guys
- [12:18] saw earlier. And something that I would
- [12:20] challenge you to think about is just to
- [12:21] keep it really, really simple. Like the
- [12:23] example where Claude sent over an email
- [12:25] for us to send in N. It was literally
- [12:27] just the web hook to receive the data
- [12:29] and then the Gmail node to send it off.
- [12:31] And in this specific example, a lot of
- [12:33] the workflows are just simple two or
- [12:35] three or even one node steps. So the
- [12:37] point I'm trying to make here is you
- [12:38] probably already have lots of workflows
- [12:39] you could go ahead and plug into
- [12:40] something like claude or chatbt right
- [12:42] away and add value. But you could also
- [12:44] build some really simple like one node
- [12:46] tools and just connect them to anything
- [12:48] that you're typically spending more time
- [12:49] in. And even if they look like this,
- [12:51] it's just simple conditional logic and
- [12:53] it gets the job done really fast. So
- [12:55] anyways, if you want to explore
- [12:56] different use cases and talk more about
- [12:57] some of the stuff, then you should
- [12:58] definitely check out my plus community.
- [13:00] The link for that is down in the
- [13:01] description. We've got over 200 members
- [13:02] who are building with NAND and building
- [13:04] businesses with Naden every single day.
- [13:06] We've got a classroom section full of
- [13:08] courses. We've got agent zero, which is
- [13:09] the foundations for beginners, 10 hours
- [13:11] to 10 seconds, where you learn how to
- [13:12] identify, design, and build time-saving
- [13:14] automations. And then for our premium
- [13:16] members, we have one person AI agency
- [13:18] and subs to sales. And then we've got
- [13:19] tons of step-by-step live build projects
- [13:22] in here. We also run a live Q&A every
- [13:24] single week. So, I'd love to see you
- [13:25] guys in those calls in the community.
- [13:27] But that's going to do it for the video.
- [13:28] So, if you enjoyed, please give it a
- [13:30] like. It definitely helps me out a ton.
- [13:31] And as always, I appreciate you guys
- [13:32] making it to the end of the video. I'll
- [13:34] see you on the next one.
