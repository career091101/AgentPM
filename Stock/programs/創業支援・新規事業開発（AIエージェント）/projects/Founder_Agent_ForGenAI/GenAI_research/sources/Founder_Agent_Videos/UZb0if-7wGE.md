## Text

- [00:03] For the past few weeks, I have
- [00:04] completely switched from cursor to cloud
- [00:06] code and learned a ton of things that
- [00:08] made my cloud code super effective. And
- [00:10] today, I will take you through how do I
- [00:12] use cloud code, how did I bring hero
- [00:14] type of specdriven demand process as
- [00:16] well as tips and practical examples of
- [00:19] how I use feature like hooks, custom
- [00:21] commands, and list of tips that made
- [00:23] myself much more effective. So, without
- [00:25] further ado, let's get started. But
- [00:27] before we dive into that, I know many of
- [00:29] you are just getting started learning
- [00:30] programming. And one question I got
- [00:32] asked a lot is what does road map look
- [00:35] like for learning code effectively.
- [00:37] That's why I want to introduce you to
- [00:38] this free ebook made by Google's
- [00:40] principal analytics lead and data
- [00:42] scientist where she wrote down all the
- [00:44] secret tips and methodologies that she
- [00:46] used to learn coding with claw and chatb
- [00:49] especially how she get output
- [00:51] personalized learning road map based on
- [00:53] her specific situation. It also cover
- [00:55] all the absolute fundamentals and basics
- [00:57] of coding like how do you choose the
- [00:59] right coding language to start with and
- [01:02] best practice prompt for different
- [01:03] coding scenario like debugging and
- [01:05] optimizing the code as well detailed
- [01:07] road map of how to master language like
- [01:09] Python in just four months. There's even
- [01:12] a custom GPT that has baking all the
- [01:14] core knowledge of latest package and
- [01:17] learning resource that you can talk to
- [01:19] alongside detailed video tutorial
- [01:20] showcasing her step-by-step work. So, I
- [01:22] definitely recommend you go take a look
- [01:24] if you're just getting started with your
- [01:26] coding journey. I put a link in the
- [01:28] description below for you to download
- [01:29] for free and thanks HubSpot for sharing
- [01:32] this awesome material with us. Now,
- [01:34] let's get back to how do I use cloud
- [01:35] code. So, first thing first, you want to
- [01:37] install this cloud code extension and
- [01:40] this will allow you to deeply integrate
- [01:42] into your current ID like cursor, VS
- [01:44] code or wingserf. So now I can click on
- [01:46] this run cloud code button and it will
- [01:49] automatically open cloud code in my
- [01:50] current ID and on the bottom right you
- [01:53] should see that it is detecting the
- [01:54] specific file I'm in and if I select
- [01:56] some lines it will also automatically
- [01:57] detect it. You can still use the
- [01:59] terminal here as well and you can just
- [02:01] do / IDE to choose the specific ID that
- [02:04] you wanted to connect to. Next the first
- [02:06] thing before you do anything is that you
- [02:08] should run this init command line. So
- [02:11] what this in command line do is that it
- [02:13] will get cloud start analyzing your
- [02:15] codebase to learn about what already set
- [02:17] up what are the kind of dependencies
- [02:19] components that you should be using. It
- [02:21] will also ask your permission to do
- [02:23] something for those type of commands
- [02:24] like cd I just don't care I will just
- [02:26] click on always auto approve and you
- [02:28] will see this thing is automatically
- [02:30] saved as permissions. I know some of you
- [02:32] actually want to get cloud code always
- [02:34] automatically run tools and there's a
- [02:36] way you can run that as well. You can do
- [02:38] this dangerously skip permissions and
- [02:41] this will show you that it is bypassing
- [02:42] all the permissions. So now tool it will
- [02:44] ask you for permission though I wouldn't
- [02:46] actually recommend this because from my
- [02:48] experience one of the key advantage of
- [02:50] the cloud codes UX is that allow you to
- [02:52] interact with cloud much better and I
- [02:55] will explain what I mean. All right so
- [02:56] after it scan finish it will try to
- [02:58] create this cloud MD file. If you're
- [03:00] using cursor, that's basically your
- [03:01] cursor rules. And if we click inside,
- [03:03] you can see that it automatically detect
- [03:05] what are the kind of tax stack, what are
- [03:08] the ROM build commands, the
- [03:09] architecture, the project structure, all
- [03:12] the useful stuff. So this give cloud a
- [03:14] very good base to continue developing
- [03:16] new things on top of this ripple. And
- [03:18] this cloud MD as I mentioned before is
- [03:20] pretty much the cursor rules. The only
- [03:22] difference is that in cursor the rules
- [03:24] are injected more programmatically. But
- [03:26] for cloud is much easier. Basically
- [03:28] every single run this text you define
- [03:30] here is appended on top of system
- [03:33] message and I know there are a lot of
- [03:34] people have different sorts of like a
- [03:36] cursor rules that to enhance the
- [03:38] workflow. For me it normally is pretty
- [03:40] simple. One prom I do add in is this
- [03:42] plan and review mode. This basically
- [03:44] tell cloud code that before we start
- [03:46] working on the project always in the
- [03:47] plan mode make a plan first. And for the
- [03:49] plan we want to save to this docloud
- [03:52] /task/taskname.md
- [03:54] so that we can keep track that later.
- [03:56] And inside this task, we should kind of
- [03:57] break down into different tasks. While
- [03:59] cloud code is doing its job, it should
- [04:01] also update the plan as we go and append
- [04:03] what it does into the doc. And this is
- [04:05] really useful because it is almost
- [04:07] always better to just align with cloud
- [04:09] code what exactly do you want. And this
- [04:11] kind of also similar to Amazon's new uh
- [04:13] kro workflow as well where they call it
- [04:16] like spec driven development. And what
- [04:19] it does is kind of similar. Uh it will
- [04:21] ask you to go through the requirements
- [04:22] and also kind of go through the
- [04:24] architecture design come up. It's
- [04:26] basically same thing and obviously you
- [04:28] can go as deep as like ko where you will
- [04:30] break down this three steps process but
- [04:33] I often found it's effective enough to
- [04:35] just do one kind of prd. So I will save
- [04:38] this and now we can get cloud code to
- [04:39] start implementing our feature. Normally
- [04:41] the first thing I would do is make a
- [04:43] plan. So our give prompt we are building
- [04:45] a beautiful online ID front end. help me
- [04:47] break down into key components and put
- [04:49] them together in the end. And here I'm
- [04:51] going to do shift tab. It will firstly
- [04:53] get into this auto accept edits mode,
- [04:55] but you want to shift tab again into
- [04:57] plan mode. So this plan mode is a really
- [05:00] really useful feature. When the agent is
- [05:02] in plan mode, it has this special system
- [05:04] prompt and limit access to tools. So it
- [05:07] will focus on doing things like web
- [05:08] search to understand the latest like tax
- [05:10] stack or documentations and also
- [05:13] planning the architecture and in the end
- [05:15] it will generate final reports and this
- [05:17] planning sometimes will take a while for
- [05:19] any feature that is semi complicated. I
- [05:21] would always do this plan mode first
- [05:23] back and forth a few times to align the
- [05:25] plan with cloud code and only after I
- [05:28] getting it start implementing the
- [05:29] feature. So here you will see that it is
- [05:31] showing task. When you see task it
- [05:33] basically means cloud code is calling a
- [05:35] sub aents that is specifically doing
- [05:37] this planning and research. So at
- [05:39] default cloud code has 17 different
- [05:41] tools that can do things like run
- [05:42] command line, read and find files, file
- [05:45] operations and web search. And this task
- [05:47] tool basically means it will launch a
- [05:49] new agent for keywords and file search.
- [05:51] When cloud code agent is calling this
- [05:53] task tool, it basically is creating
- [05:56] another agent that has almost all the
- [05:57] tool except those planning related tools
- [06:00] like task to-do and this agent will
- [06:01] receive a well-defined tasks from the
- [06:04] parent agent do a list of things and in
- [06:05] the end say here are the findings. Only
- [06:08] the last part which is summary of the
- [06:10] findings will be sent back to the parent
- [06:12] cloud code agent. And this is one
- [06:14] message they have to really save the
- [06:15] token consumption for the parent agent
- [06:17] because otherwise the main agent might
- [06:19] be flooded with all sorts of context.
- [06:21] And knowing this, you can actually
- [06:22] utilize this task to a lot better. For
- [06:24] example, you can actually prompt cloud
- [06:25] code to use task two to set up multiple
- [06:28] parallel agent to do different task at
- [06:30] the same time. But also if there's a
- [06:32] task that you know already, it's going
- [06:34] to read some very large files. Try to
- [06:36] prompt cloud code to just use task two
- [06:38] to do this because that will help you
- [06:39] save the token a lot on the main agent.
- [06:41] So now I finished the planning and come
- [06:44] back with a plan about what are the
- [06:46] layout system should look like file
- [06:48] explorer which makes sense the code
- [06:50] editor component it decide to use
- [06:52] existing library and then it will break
- [06:54] down into different phases. The phase
- [06:56] one is just install everything and the
- [06:58] phase two is implement file explorer
- [07:00] code editor terminal integration and
- [07:03] some advanced feature as well as the
- [07:05] project directory plan. So this is a
- [07:08] pretty good plan and obviously I can
- [07:10] keep planning but here I can also ask it
- [07:12] to start do this plan and next is that
- [07:15] it will create this detailed
- [07:16] implementation plan incloud/tasks
- [07:19] and I will click yes. So it will create
- [07:21] this task folder and create this online
- [07:24] ID front end with a detailed plan and
- [07:26] tasks. So now I can ask it to let's do
- [07:29] phase one. It will create a to-do based
- [07:31] on the phase one requirements. So while
- [07:33] it is running I'm just going to quickly
- [07:35] talk about this to-do. So I was quite
- [07:37] curious how did cloud code actually
- [07:39] handle this to-do. Do they handling to a
- [07:42] different like planner agent to just
- [07:44] specifically come up with plan and
- [07:45] programmatically get the agent to do one
- [07:48] task of another? So I did some
- [07:49] investigation. What I found is the
- [07:51] entropy team actually took the the
- [07:53] simplest setup possible. Uh but it's
- [07:55] really effective. It has this tool
- [07:56] called to-do right description is
- [07:58] basically use this tool to create and
- [08:00] manage and structure task list. They
- [08:02] have a very specific prompt talk about
- [08:03] like when to use this tool, when to not
- [08:05] use this tool, some example as well. So
- [08:07] every time when agent run this tool, it
- [08:09] will try to come up a list to-do and
- [08:11] each to-do will have the content ID,
- [08:13] priority and status. It is as simple as
- [08:15] this. So now if we come back here it
- [08:18] finish all the to-do it also going back
- [08:21] to our doc and adding details about what
- [08:24] it actually did. So it marked this as
- [08:26] completed and also document all the
- [08:28] things that it does. Cool. So it has
- [08:30] this component implemented that it has
- [08:32] this file explorer resizable. It has
- [08:36] terminal. I can add multiple different
- [08:37] terminal as well. Nice. Obviously you
- [08:40] can see I can continue going because it
- [08:42] already have trace of the overall plan.
- [08:44] So every time it just need to focus on
- [08:46] one specific piece of work and if there
- [08:48] any time when the plan change we can
- [08:50] just prompt it to update the stock. So
- [08:52] this is kind my like doc or spec focused
- [08:55] workflow with cloud code. But what's
- [08:57] really cool about cloud code is that you
- [08:58] can customize cloud code in very deep
- [09:00] manner. So one super interesting feature
- [09:02] is hooks. So hook is a feature that
- [09:04] allow you to define things to happen
- [09:07] programmatically when cloud code takes
- [09:09] certain actions. One of the most basic
- [09:11] and common hook that I use is this stop
- [09:13] hook. So I can define a rule here when
- [09:16] cloud code stop which means it finish
- [09:17] the task it try to run this command
- [09:20] which will basically play the system
- [09:21] sound to notify me that the task has
- [09:24] been completed. So with this one if I
- [09:26] just send a message to cloud it'll play
- [09:28] this notification sound after the task
- [09:30] is finished. So this is basically simple
- [09:31] concept of hook but interesting thing is
- [09:34] that the customization here can go
- [09:35] pretty deep. Cloud code allow you to
- [09:36] define things to do before or after
- [09:38] certain tool is wrong or when user try
- [09:40] to send a new message to cloud code so
- [09:43] that you can ingest some additional
- [09:44] context in as well as when cloud try to
- [09:47] compress the conversation history or
- [09:49] when a sub agent finishes task and
- [09:51] here's a more sophisticated example that
- [09:53] I found actually pretty useful. So I can
- [09:54] define this post to use hook that every
- [09:57] time after cloud code run a edit
- [09:59] multi-edit or write to which means it
- [10:01] modify or create some new files. It will
- [10:03] run this Python file I define here
- [10:05] called type check. So this is a feature
- [10:07] that I probably missed the most from
- [10:08] cursor is that in cursor it has this
- [10:10] automatic linked arrow detection and
- [10:13] this is really useful context so that
- [10:14] cursor can capture those errors even
- [10:16] before you run the code and proactively
- [10:19] fix issue. But for cloud it didn't have
- [10:20] this and this hook will basically
- [10:22] replicate that functionality directly.
- [10:24] So inside this Python file it might look
- [10:27] a bit complicated but I will quickly
- [10:28] explain to you what that means. So we
- [10:31] firstly try to get input data. Each hook
- [10:33] comes with a list of different inputs
- [10:35] that you can use. For example for the
- [10:37] post to use input it will automatically
- [10:39] give you a list data that you can use in
- [10:40] this like which tool it is what are the
- [10:42] input agent generate for this tool and
- [10:44] what's the output of tool. And in our
- [10:46] case, we want to get the file so we know
- [10:47] which file agent just created or
- [10:49] modified. Then we'll get a file pass.
- [10:51] And if this file extension is ts or tsx,
- [10:53] which means it's typescript, we will run
- [10:55] the type check. And if this type check
- [10:57] failed, this is a part where we can send
- [10:59] feedback back to cloud code. So you will
- [11:01] do the print and the file will be system
- [11:03] std error. Here I define code to be two.
- [11:06] So code two means that it is a blocking
- [11:09] arrow and std arrow will be fed back to
- [11:11] cloud code so that it can use that to
- [11:13] define the next actions. But you can
- [11:15] also define other asset code that will
- [11:17] still send message back to cloud code
- [11:19] but it won't blocking it from continue
- [11:21] the next action. So with this hook if
- [11:23] cloud code generates on files that has
- [11:25] type errors it will automatically call
- [11:27] the script and return back a error
- [11:29] message if it has any type. So cloud
- [11:32] code can try to proactively fix issue.
- [11:34] So this is how hook works and there are
- [11:35] a lot of potentials. For example, you
- [11:37] can even define some critic agent. After
- [11:39] cloud code write any code, it can write
- [11:41] a test and validate it or if it write
- [11:43] API doc, you can automatically update
- [11:45] documentations. I have included a few
- [11:47] common hooks that I use a lot in AI
- [11:49] builder club. So you can go and grab. If
- [11:51] you guys want a more deep dive or hook
- [11:53] feature, please comment below, let me
- [11:54] know. I'm happy to do another one. On
- [11:56] the outside, cloud code also have this
- [11:58] commands feature where they do come with
- [12:00] a list of predefined command like check
- [12:03] cost, set up MCP, memory, models and
- [12:06] review PR commands even, but they also
- [12:08] allow you to define custom slash
- [12:10] commands. For example, I can create a
- [12:12] commands folder under cloud and just
- [12:14] create something called joke MD and make
- [12:17] a joke in all caps. Once I did this, I
- [12:21] can do slash and search for joke. Then
- [12:23] this command I define here will be
- [12:25] showing up. If I click on that, whatever
- [12:27] you define here in this command will
- [12:29] basically be sent to cloud code almost
- [12:31] as a prompt. Network start behave based
- [12:33] on the rules you define there. I have
- [12:35] another video where I talk about
- [12:37] different commands that I predefined
- [12:39] that can help you extract specific
- [12:41] styling from a screenshots as well as
- [12:43] getting cloud code into design mode to
- [12:45] design multiple different UI iterations.
- [12:47] And you can even have a command to get a
- [12:48] cloud code to set up multiple different
- [12:50] git work tree to have sub agents working
- [12:52] in parallel. So you can go check out
- [12:54] this video if you want to learn more.
- [12:55] And there's a one package I thought is
- [12:57] pretty useful recently called
- [12:58] supercloud. It's a open source package
- [13:00] that comes with bunch of commands that
- [13:03] they predefine and build. For example, I
- [13:04] can do slash command SC analyze. This
- [13:07] will trigger that command that take
- [13:09] cloud into a much deeper code analyze
- [13:12] mode. It will create list of to-do to
- [13:14] look through the whole codebase and come
- [13:15] back with a kind of architecture review.
- [13:18] There are other useful things like you
- [13:20] can run workflow to look at a PRD doc to
- [13:23] get cloud into kind of step-by-step
- [13:25] implementation process as well as build
- [13:28] command that will help bundle and npm
- [13:30] build your projects as well as
- [13:32] troubleshoot if you have some weird bug
- [13:33] that you don't know how to fix. So this
- [13:35] is a really useful package even though
- [13:37] the installation is not that
- [13:38] straightforward. We need to open in a
- [13:40] folder do uv in it first to set up a
- [13:42] python project and then do uv as
- [13:45] supercloud. This will add this
- [13:46] supercloud package and in the end do UV
- [13:48] run Python supercloud install then it
- [13:51] will take you through the step-by-step
- [13:52] installation process but once you
- [13:54] install it will be installed at global
- [13:55] level so you don't need to keep doing
- [13:57] this and all the file will be basically
- [13:59] saved to your docloud settings at user
- [14:01] level if we open it it will basically
- [14:03] add stuff into the cloud MD which link
- [14:06] to all the different files that contain
- [14:08] more details inside this command folder
- [14:11] you can see all the commands that you
- [14:12] define here so this kind of quick
- [14:14] example of how far the customization you
- [14:16] can do with just command feature.
- [14:19] Meanwhile, the list of very useful
- [14:20] feature and shortcuts that cloud code
- [14:22] has that I didn't know initially.
- [14:24] Firstly, I can do slash resume to
- [14:26] jumping back to a past conversation
- [14:28] history and continue the conversation
- [14:30] there. This is kind of similar to cursor
- [14:31] where you can choose a past
- [14:33] conversation. But on the other hand,
- [14:35] they also introduces export command. So
- [14:37] this feature will allow you to copy the
- [14:39] whole conversation history with cloud
- [14:41] code. So you can jump between cloud
- [14:42] code, cursor, werf or any other coding
- [14:46] IDE because you just need to paste in
- [14:48] conversation history and no need to
- [14:49] worry that cursor don't have the context
- [14:51] about what has been done and quite often
- [14:53] I will also go to cloud where I have
- [14:55] unlimited amount token to do some early
- [14:58] exploration. Apart from that another
- [14:59] really useful feature is that you can
- [15:02] double tap exit and this will allow you
- [15:03] to revert back conversation history to a
- [15:06] past point. So you can just click that
- [15:08] and continue the conversation from that
- [15:10] point. This really good because
- [15:11] sometimes cloud code will make a
- [15:13] mistakes and this can avoid it. The only
- [15:15] downside is that if you're in cursor
- [15:17] when revert back to a past conversation
- [15:19] it will automatically revert back all
- [15:20] your files as well but cloud code didn't
- [15:22] keep a snapshot. So you actually need to
- [15:24] use some external package to do the
- [15:27] snapshot and versioning. One of them is
- [15:29] called CC undo. So this is a package
- [15:31] that will automatically detect all the
- [15:33] changes that cloud code has made to your
- [15:35] file and allow it to roll back. So I can
- [15:37] do CC undo and the list. This will list
- [15:40] out all the change that your cloud code
- [15:41] has been made and you can do CC undo
- [15:43] preview to see the specific change that
- [15:45] cloud code has been made and then once
- [15:47] you confirm you can do CC undo undo and
- [15:49] select a change you want to revert. So
- [15:51] this package can work with cloud code
- [15:52] handing pretty well. Though the command
- [15:55] line might not be the best and easiest
- [15:56] way for you to preview the work. There
- [15:58] are more userfriendly version like yo-yo
- [16:00] where it receive a snapshot and you can
- [16:02] add some additional instructions to
- [16:04] remember what the changes are. Another
- [16:06] quite useful shortcut is that you can
- [16:07] type in acceleration mark. And this will
- [16:09] get the cloud code into bash mode. So
- [16:11] bash mode allow you to run command
- [16:13] directly without going outside cloud
- [16:15] code. So I can do quickshot car like
- [16:17] pmppm install or pmppm add certain
- [16:19] package and it will just run the command
- [16:21] directly here. So it is really fast but
- [16:23] also the more important part is that
- [16:25] this context will be part of
- [16:26] conversation history so that cloud code
- [16:28] will know what are the actions that
- [16:30] you've been taken and similarly you can
- [16:31] also do hashtag which will activate the
- [16:34] memory mode. So here is where you can
- [16:36] type in things that you want cloud code
- [16:38] to memorize like I'm JSON we're building
- [16:40] online ID using chassis and component
- [16:42] and then it will ask you to choose where
- [16:44] do you want to save this memory it can
- [16:46] be per level or can be user level across
- [16:48] all the projects and once you confirm it
- [16:50] just save that information to the
- [16:52] cloudme and the last part I also want to
- [16:54] show you the easiest way for you to
- [16:56] connect cloud code to kim K2 model if
- [16:58] you don't know Kim K2 model is a new
- [17:00] open-source coding model that has
- [17:02] similar performance like cloud 3.5 to
- [17:04] cloud four but 80% cheaper. So it is
- [17:07] really good one to experiment if you run
- [17:08] out of credits. And the easiest way to
- [17:10] set up is that you can open terminal and
- [17:12] do code open this zshrc file. If you're
- [17:16] on Mac like me, you probably just do
- [17:18] this. But if you're on Windows, you
- [17:19] might need to change to bash. This will
- [17:21] open a file like this. So this will
- [17:23] basically control your terminal
- [17:25] behavior. So here I will define Kimi API
- [17:27] key. And don't worry, I already disabled
- [17:28] this key. So it's not going to work for
- [17:30] you guys anymore. And I can define kimi
- [17:32] where it will export entropic base URL
- [17:34] to moonshot using this API key and run
- [17:37] cloud. So with this one I can just go to
- [17:40] my any terminal and then do kimi. This
- [17:42] will open cloud code with the special
- [17:44] model that I defined there. So if I type
- [17:46] in hi here it is actually going to talk
- [17:48] to the kimi k2 model. And similarly you
- [17:51] can also define things here like claw
- [17:54] bash maintain per working directory to
- [17:56] be one. What this will do is that
- [17:58] basically every time when cloud is
- [18:00] running, it will always append the
- [18:01] current working directory into the
- [18:03] prompt. So it will always remember where
- [18:05] it is instead of running command in run
- [18:08] place. So here's a quick overview of how
- [18:10] I use cloud code. If you want to learn
- [18:11] more, you can join AI builder club where
- [18:13] we have weekly sessions to talk through
- [18:15] the latest workflow and tips for AI
- [18:17] coding and build large language models
- [18:19] as well as all detailed rules, hooks and
- [18:21] commands that I personally use. So you
- [18:23] can copy paste directly. In upcoming
- [18:25] weeks, we'll have more detailed
- [18:26] breakdown of how does a cloud code
- [18:28] actually work behind the scenes and try
- [18:30] to rebuild cloud code from scratch so
- [18:31] that we can learn the best practice of
- [18:33] building effective AI coding agents. I
- [18:35] put a link in the description below for
- [18:37] you to join. I hope you enjoy this
- [18:38] video. Thank you and I see you next
- [18:40] time.
