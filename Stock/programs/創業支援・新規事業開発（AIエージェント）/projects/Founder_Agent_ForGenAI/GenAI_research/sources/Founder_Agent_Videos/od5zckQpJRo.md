- [00:00] Hey chat GPT start computer use to
- [00:02] create GPT6.
- [00:08] Google deep mind released a new Gemini
- [00:11] 2.5 computer use model uh a few days ago
- [00:15] maybe yesterday already I think so. So
- [00:17] today uh I built an MCP server that is
- [00:20] using this uh computer use model. So I
- [00:23] have kind of two stages. One is browser
- [00:26] use and one is controlling my Mac here.
- [00:29] Right. So, uh it's pretty interesting
- [00:31] and the MCP server is working great. So,
- [00:33] today I just want to take you through a
- [00:35] few different use cases uh how we can
- [00:38] use this computer use model from Gemini
- [00:41] to yeah control our computer or our
- [00:44] browser. So, let's just get into it and
- [00:47] I can show you a few things we can do
- [00:48] with this. To show you this uh we are
- [00:50] going to use cloud code. So, I'm just
- [00:52] going to go to cloud code here. I'm
- [00:54] going to do my I have a global one for
- [00:56] this. So/MCP you can see computer use
- [00:59] this the only one we have here and if
- [01:01] you look at the tools now I kind of did
- [01:03] this in two different um yeah I can
- [01:06] quickly show you the code here but we
- [01:08] have four tools for browser use and we
- [01:11] have four tools for open Mac as u Mac OS
- [01:14] app control app do a screenshot and
- [01:17] actions and we have the same for browser
- [01:19] use right screenshot and execute actions
- [01:22] so if you look at the code here I'm not
- [01:24] going to go through the code but you can
- [01:25] see we have one uh TypeScript for
- [01:27] browser and we have one for MacOSS right
- [01:31] and in the index we kind of reference to
- [01:33] both so we can control them uh yeah you
- [01:36] can see some examples here uh but I
- [01:39] don't want to spend too much time on
- [01:40] this here's kind of our type definitions
- [01:43] like I said X screenshot Mac screenshot
- [01:46] browser and you kind of get the point uh
- [01:49] if people want to dive deeper into this
- [01:51] let me know if you are interested in the
- [01:53] exact code here But the idea today is
- [01:57] just show you how this work in practice
- [01:59] and kind of how well this model performs
- [02:02] in real use cases. So I think I want to
- [02:05] start off with a MacOSS use case. Then
- [02:08] we can do a browser use case and maybe
- [02:10] finish with the favorite use case I
- [02:12] created. Uh yeah, you will see that in
- [02:14] the end of the video. So let's just
- [02:16] start with something simple here for the
- [02:19] the Mac OS app. So, uh, I think it was
- [02:22] last week before the new Taylor Swift
- [02:24] album, I asked Sunno to create like a
- [02:27] new try to guess what the songs were
- [02:30] going to be on that new album. And it
- [02:33] created a song called Elizabeth. Yeah,
- [02:35] it's an uh video file ismpp4.
- [02:39] And we're going to ask the computer to
- [02:41] find this uh on my Mac and rightclick
- [02:44] the file and open it with a quick time
- [02:46] player. So, I'm just going to hit enter
- [02:49] now. And we're going to see the MCP
- [02:51] server. Now do some yeah commands to
- [02:54] this model. Right? If you wait a second,
- [02:56] you can see tool use here. Find the file
- [02:58] name uh here on the computer. Right
- [03:00] click, open the quick time player. Max
- [03:02] turns 15. So we have like a limit on
- [03:05] turns here. So I'm just going to say
- [03:07] yes. So now, of course, I'm hands off.
- [03:10] You can see that. So this is going to
- [03:12] try to use the tools we created with the
- [03:14] MCP uh with the model now. Okay. So we
- [03:17] got some errors here. So, it needs to
- [03:18] maybe do a smaller screenshots. Let's
- [03:20] try that again. Uh, okay. So, now you
- [03:23] can see it went to the finder. It's
- [03:25] probably going to do some kind of
- [03:26] search. Let's see.
- [03:29] Okay. So, it's clicked on search. That's
- [03:30] good. So, let's see if it types in
- [03:33] Elizabeth, I would say. I would guess
- [03:35] would be the best the thing to do here.
- [03:38] Yeah, it's doing Elizabeth MP4. Great.
- [03:41] So, it found that. So, now it should
- [03:43] just rightclick it and do open with
- [03:46] QuickTime player.
- [03:49] Okay, so it's going into archive. So it
- [03:52] should do open w with or open me here in
- [03:55] Norwegian and it should do quicktime
- [03:57] player. So let's see if it finds that.
- [04:00] Okay, so open with and we have quicktime
- [04:03] player and hopefully that should open up
- [04:05] the video. So you can see it's not very
- [04:08] fast, but it is pretty good at actually
- [04:10] finding the right pixels. Okay, good. So
- [04:13] I don't know if it's going to click play
- [04:14] here. Let's see.
- [04:24] Okay. So, I would say that was task
- [04:26] completed. So, you can see it found it,
- [04:28] opened it, and played it. So, yeah, it's
- [04:32] playing the content. Uh, so I think that
- [04:34] was a pretty good job. Wasn't really
- [04:36] fast. I would do it, of course, much
- [04:38] faster, but I think it executed pretty
- [04:40] well on controlling my computer here. So
- [04:43] now let's go over to the browser use
- [04:45] case and see if we can do that. Okay, so
- [04:47] I wanted to see if we can do some uh
- [04:49] filling out some forms. So we have this
- [04:51] robo form here test. Yeah, something we
- [04:54] can do here, right? We can test this to
- [04:56] fill out forms. So I'm going to go to my
- [04:58] MCP server. I have a big film uh form to
- [05:01] fill out. I'm going to do the URL. Help
- [05:04] me fill out all of this. Uh the
- [05:06] assignment should is to role play as Neo
- [05:08] from Matrix, right? So just make up
- [05:11] something to fill out. So what happens
- [05:12] when we run this now? So this is not
- [05:15] going to be opened in Chrome now. This
- [05:17] is going to be opened in um uh Chromium
- [05:21] I guess. Play right. So you can see
- [05:23] we're going to do the screenshot page or
- [05:25] I'm not quite sure. Maybe you're going
- [05:27] to do it something else. Uh I think it's
- [05:29] just going to be the Chromium one,
- [05:31] right? Yeah. So we go to this robo form
- [05:34] filler here. We do a screenshot. And now
- [05:36] I think we go back to computer use and
- [05:39] planning out back to the cloud code
- [05:42] agent to plan out what we're going to
- [05:44] fill out. So we go back in again. Okay.
- [05:47] So we did that extra evaluated. It's
- [05:49] scrolled down just to see the full page.
- [05:51] And now it's going to fill out the form
- [05:53] as Nate Neo from Matrix. You can see
- [05:55] here it's doing the plan. Okay. I'm
- [05:58] going to say yes to that. Okay. So we go
- [06:00] back to the robo form. Uh now I kind of
- [06:02] want to see it start filling out this.
- [06:04] Right. So, we should just press got it
- [06:07] there on the cookies and start filling
- [06:10] out uh because it has all the
- [06:11] information it needs now, I think. Yeah,
- [06:14] you can see we start with Mister and
- [06:16] it's probably going to be Thomas, isn't
- [06:18] that Thomas Anderson? Yeah. So, I'm just
- [06:21] going to speed this up and I'll be back
- [06:23] when uh let's see how far we can if we
- [06:26] can do the full thing. I'm not quite
- [06:27] sure because of the turns, but let's see
- [06:29] how far we get here.
- [06:32] Okay, as you probably saw, it closed
- [06:34] down the page, but you can you kind of
- [06:36] saw it filled out all the forms. So, not
- [06:40] I think it stopped uh on a few last of
- [06:42] the fields because we didn't have any
- [06:43] more turns here. I could have up the max
- [06:45] turns, but that's fine. Uh it did
- [06:47] actually do what we asked for and I
- [06:49] think it worked pretty good. So, uh I
- [06:51] want to do a final test and that is
- [06:52] going to be back on the MacOSS use and
- [06:55] we're going to do some terminal stuff.
- [06:56] So, let's see how that uh works. Okay,
- [06:59] so the final thing I wanted to do was to
- [07:01] use the computer, use MCP, open up
- [07:03] cursor, create a file, uh, hello
- [07:05] YouTube.py, add Python code to print
- [07:08] hello YouTube, then execute this code.
- [07:11] Uh, I'm just going to set the max turn
- [07:13] to 15. So, let's just see what happens
- [07:15] now. Are we going to go into cursor? Are
- [07:17] we going to go open up a new version?
- [07:19] Let's just see. I haven't tried this
- [07:21] before. Okay, so I guess we went
- [07:22] straight to cursor. Um, does it even
- [07:25] know how to navigate this? I'm not quite
- [07:28] sure. Okay, so we did a new file at
- [07:30] least. So, let's see what happens now.
- [07:32] It's probably going to screenshot this.
- [07:35] And it should just be able to Where is
- [07:37] that file? Is it this?
- [07:40] Okay, so it's
- [07:43] that's not going too well. Why is it
- [07:45] writing so strangely? Maybe I should set
- [07:48] that on a region European keyboard. I'm
- [07:51] not quite sure. Okay, so now it's trying
- [07:53] to save the file, I guess. So it's
- [07:55] called it some kind of untitled Hello
- [07:57] Python. Okay, that's it's not perfect,
- [08:00] but I guess it's fine. Okay, so it is
- [08:02] actually doing a fine job saving here, I
- [08:05] guess. But we also need the code in this
- [08:07] file. Okay, so now we have the Python
- [08:09] here. Let's see if we can actually do
- [08:11] the coding code here. Okay, so it looks
- [08:13] like we did the correct code here. So
- [08:15] it's print hello YouTube. That looks
- [08:17] better. So now it has to save this
- [08:19] before we can run it. Why is it doing a
- [08:22] new agent? So, I'm not quite sure if
- [08:25] it's just going to go to file or save or
- [08:27] if it's just going to do control uh
- [08:29] command s. Okay, so it did save it. So,
- [08:32] it's going to Python hello YouTube.py
- [08:34] can open it. No such file. Was it the
- [08:37] wrong file? I did a plus sign. Okay, so
- [08:41] let's see what it's going to do then.
- [08:43] Okay, so it clicked on the split edit or
- [08:45] why? Just click on the play now and we
- [08:48] should be good to go. I don't know if it
- [08:50] knows the keyboard layout. I'm not quite
- [08:51] sure what's going on here now. It's
- [08:53] trying to change the name of the file.
- [08:55] Okay. Okay. So, it changed the name to
- [08:58] hello.py.
- [09:00] Okay. Why is it doing a new terminal
- [09:03] now? It's so close now. It just has to
- [09:06] run the Python code and we should be
- [09:08] good to go here. Okay. So, why did it
- [09:10] close the terminal now? That was very
- [09:12] strange.
- [09:14] Okay. So, it has the terminal now at
- [09:15] least again.
- [09:18] So all it has to do now is do python
- [09:20] hello yt.py and we should be done here.
- [09:24] Okay, so we're doing a screenshot.
- [09:27] Okay, finally.
- [09:29] That took forever. That was very
- [09:32] unefficient, but we got there in the
- [09:34] end. Okay, that's fine, I guess. Uh but
- [09:38] uh yeah, that wasn't too impressive, but
- [09:41] it was cool, but not very impressive.
- [09:43] But overall, I think this new model is h
- [09:45] quite exciting. Uh, I had a lot of fun
- [09:47] with it setting up this MCP, trying out
- [09:50] different stuff. Uh, there were some
- [09:51] clips I didn't include. I tried to do
- [09:54] some painting uh on paint and I did some
- [09:57] other stuff with Yeah, maybe in another
- [10:00] video. Uh, but there's a lot of fun
- [10:01] things you can do with this. Is this
- [10:03] perfect now? I don't think so. Uh, but
- [10:06] it's getting incrementally better. It's
- [10:08] much better than the first time I tried
- [10:10] the cloud computer use. and it's just
- [10:13] keep uh upping each other these
- [10:15] different model providers. So, it is a
- [10:17] step forward and it's going to be
- [10:19] interesting to see where this part of
- [10:21] the stack goes. And it's pretty
- [10:23] interesting when you combine it with an
- [10:25] MCP tool and you can just get access to
- [10:28] more context and your context
- [10:30] engineering can get like a bump up in
- [10:32] level if you find the right use cases
- [10:34] for it. Uh, I had a lot of fun playing
- [10:36] around with my Mac computer uh,
- [10:38] controls, but it's a bit risky, so I
- [10:42] don't know if I recommend it. But go
- [10:43] check it out. Gemini 2.5 computer use
- [10:46] model. Thank you for tuning in. Have a
- [10:48] great day, and I'll see you again soon.
