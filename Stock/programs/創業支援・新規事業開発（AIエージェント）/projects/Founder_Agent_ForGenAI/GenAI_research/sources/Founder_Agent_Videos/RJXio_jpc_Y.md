- [00:00] here is a chick that's been fluttered
- [00:02] with copper
- [00:06] kind of spooky
- [00:09] I realized I hadn't made a video yet
- [00:12] about my scanning electron microscope
- [00:14] and I've been posting pictures I got
- [00:16] from it all over my blog or website
- [00:18] recently and I wanted to make a quick
- [00:21] video where I show the setup and basic
- [00:24] operation of this microscope so this is
- [00:27] that this is a Joel jsm 6300 scanning
- [00:31] electron microscope I picked it up on
- [00:33] eBay a couple of months ago and the
- [00:37] Pascal month I've been studying up and
- [00:39] learning how to use it and it's been
- [00:41] really really fun I didn't know really
- [00:44] anything about this just a couple months
- [00:46] ago and now I'm able to operate it and
- [00:49] get the basic images so I'll give a
- [00:52] quick tour of it now so this is the main
- [00:56] console on the left here there's an
- [00:58] analog CRT monitor and on the right
- [01:00] displays the digital images that are
- [01:03] required and below it are all the
- [01:05] controls for magnification focus the
- [01:08] stig mater all kinds of scan settings
- [01:11] and here you can switch between the
- [01:13] secondary and backscatter electron
- [01:14] detectors all kinds of other things
- [01:17] because what you use to saturate your
- [01:19] filament and is a couple of keyboards
- [01:21] there's a computer built in here and
- [01:23] there's also this other computer out
- [01:24] here that runs Windows 98 and this has
- [01:26] the digital capture software and stuff
- [01:28] on that's pretty fun the image capture
- [01:32] from the day 1996 there abouts was this
- [01:35] Polaroid camera here which is pretty
- [01:37] awesome there's a CRT down here that
- [01:39] fires upward and you're supposed to put
- [01:42] polarized film in here and scanned the
- [01:44] beam across and will expose a Polaroid
- [01:48] sheet on top of the console here I have
- [01:53] electronics waveform monitor so I can
- [01:55] just Center the like NTSC analog video
- [01:58] on the sole scope I was playing around
- [02:00] earlier with measuring the probe current
- [02:02] and this is my really high tech vacuum
- [02:06] meter this is wired in the column over
- [02:09] here has three Pirani gauge is on it so
- [02:11] I tapped into one of them and I can just
- [02:14] get a it's not accurate but I can get a
- [02:16] quick visual on whether word
- [02:20] atmosphere pump down or somewhere in
- [02:23] between and pump down this is about one
- [02:25] time since the - forced to work is this
- [02:27] is a diffusion pump based machine if you
- [02:30] had the big manual which I couldn't have
- [02:31] got it working without around back of
- [02:36] the console see all the wires and
- [02:39] everything I had to connect to get this
- [02:42] thing running so there's a ton of
- [02:43] unlabeled and crazy cables and luckily I
- [02:47] had a wiring diagram so I was able to
- [02:49] figure out you know what different
- [02:50] circuit boards and things do but it
- [02:51] really is the rats mess back here this
- [02:54] is the 30 kV power supply for the
- [02:57] filament there's a high tension cable
- [02:59] that comes out of it and this is all
- [03:00] immersed in transformer oil I had to
- [03:03] replace that that was fun and this is
- [03:09] the column here so this is the actual
- [03:11] microscope the whole thing is under high
- [03:13] vacuum right now the top part here has a
- [03:16] little cap this will pop open that's
- [03:18] where your filament goes so this is the
- [03:20] electron source and the focused electron
- [03:22] beam gets shot down here there's tilt
- [03:25] and shift coils and goals focusing and
- [03:27] diggnation coils and there's an aperture
- [03:29] right here which consists of a very very
- [03:31] small piece of foil with small like 50
- [03:35] micron ish holes in it you can just and
- [03:37] center that and there's a gate valve
- [03:39] here that separates this column from
- [03:41] your specimen specimen stage and this
- [03:44] thing is pretty cool you can put up to a
- [03:46] six inch 6 inch specimen in it which is
- [03:49] quite huge especially for this being in
- [03:51] 1996 era you can draw out this entire
- [03:55] thing it'll slide out it's on like
- [03:57] little desk chair wheels down here and
- [03:59] you can put a six-inch sample in or you
- [04:02] can put a smaller sample in through the
- [04:04] load lock or an air lock in the front
- [04:08] here so I'll show you that in a bit and
- [04:11] that's a really really nice feature it
- [04:12] saves a lot of time this down here is
- [04:14] the backscattered electron preamplifier
- [04:16] this is the secondary electron detector
- [04:18] and these are motorized XY manipulators
- [04:22] that go down to a microns these are very
- [04:24] nice there's stage tilt and rotation and
- [04:28] all kinds of other adjustments
- [04:30] around there this is the evacuation
- [04:32] manifold so this is what evacuates this
- [04:35] area down to high vacuum this is one of
- [04:37] those Piranha gauges I was talking about
- [04:38] so I tap into one of those on that
- [04:41] multimeter requires a nitrogen cylinder
- [04:45] that's right here and that does there's
- [04:48] all kinds of solenoids and stuff in here
- [04:51] and it also when you bring the chamber
- [04:53] up to atmosphere rather than just
- [04:54] letting air go ahead back into the
- [04:56] chamber it can control that with the
- [04:57] nitrogen and it's also much much cleaner
- [04:59] this is the rotary mechanical pump and
- [05:03] that goes through a vibration isolators
- [05:04] down here it's like a big heavy brick
- [05:06] and then that goes into the back of
- [05:08] machine I has a side panel off here so
- [05:10] you can see the inside there's one of
- [05:14] the diffusion pumps here there's one
- [05:16] right here and then one in the back
- [05:17] there and it's a mess in here as well up
- [05:21] there there is a 10 liter vacuum
- [05:23] reservoir which allows you to pump down
- [05:25] the little airlock thing there really
- [05:29] really quickly which is nice and the
- [05:32] diffusion pumps are water cool I'll show
- [05:34] you the children in a few minutes and
- [05:37] this is the back of the vacuum control
- [05:38] board which are having some issues with
- [05:40] so I have the front panel off as well
- [05:41] this thing is supposed to automatically
- [05:44] control the vacuum system so when you
- [05:46] turn the microscope on it should rock
- [05:48] the main chamber and then evacuate it
- [05:50] down with the diffusion pumps
- [05:51] automatically but it's having some
- [05:53] issues so I have to do it manually by
- [05:54] flipping all these switches and looking
- [05:55] at this diagram here so it's a little
- [05:59] bit annoying but it's not that big of a
- [06:01] deal
- [06:02] that's everything down here the water
- [06:06] chiller which I'll show you in a second
- [06:08] needs a water supply of its own this is
- [06:09] basically a heat exchanger so I had
- [06:11] these copper pipes here plumbed and they
- [06:13] go all the way up to the ceiling and all
- [06:16] the way in the back to a to the same so
- [06:19] behind the microscope under this bench
- [06:21] here there's an electrical pedal right
- [06:25] here and so the main shutoff and then a
- [06:28] 30 amp breaker for the microscope and a
- [06:30] 15 amp breaker for the chiller this is a
- [06:33] power supply this thing has three big
- [06:35] transformers on the bottom I had to
- [06:37] change the taps on this so it takes 240
- [06:39] volts in and makes 200 volts and
- [06:42] wonderful
- [06:42] the other weird power the microscope
- [06:44] needs it's a Japanese machine and this
- [06:47] is the cello right here it'll do
- [06:50] something like plus or minus 0.1 of a
- [06:52] degrees C per hour something like that
- [06:54] and it flows about five liters per
- [06:56] minute it's got a temperature digital
- [06:59] temperature readout on the front which
- [07:01] is nice it's pretty nice unit
- [07:03] and that's basically everything for the
- [07:10] microscope so now I'll go through the
- [07:13] setup procedure and get it running we
- [07:15] can look at a couple samples first thing
- [07:17] I do is go to this panel here and hit
- [07:20] the main breaker next thing I'm going to
- [07:23] do is walk over here and turn the
- [07:26] nitrogen cylinder on and have pressure
- [07:33] the lines from last time now I'm going
- [07:38] to walk you outside of the shop by the
- [07:40] sink and this is the water supply line
- [07:44] for the chiller now that's on we can go
- [07:47] back and now I'm going to start up a
- [07:48] chiller it's going to get a little bit
- [07:49] noisy the chiller runs water through the
- [07:54] diffusion pumps and also in the back of
- [07:56] this console here there's a bunch of
- [07:57] electronics that are water-cooled so
- [08:01] this is an interlock switch for the
- [08:03] chiller
- [08:05] now that's on I want 68 degree water
- [08:09] which is about 20 degrees C right now
- [08:11] we're at 66 degrees that's going to come
- [08:13] up and we can see over here that we're
- [08:17] at 5 meters so now we have the power on
- [08:26] the water chiller and the nitrogen on
- [08:28] and we can go ahead and turn the actual
- [08:31] microscope on down here is a little key
- [08:33] switch just like starting a car you put
- [08:36] it on the on setting and then flip it to
- [08:38] start and the CRT is fully going to come
- [08:44] on you heard the rotary pump just come
- [08:46] on and some lights are turning on down
- [08:47] there on the vacuum control panel so
- [08:50] things are happening the first digital
- [08:52] CRT is coming on I'm going to boot up
- [08:54] the windows 98 computer at this point I
- [08:57] takes a little while to go turn this guy
- [09:02] on
- [09:05] and our vacuum you just turned on in the
- [09:09] meter and that's going to Center down in
- [09:13] a minute and it's going to be somewhere
- [09:14] around here when I last used it it was
- [09:17] pumped down and then it leaks up a
- [09:18] little bit but we're not quite at
- [09:20] atmosphere so in a minute here that's
- [09:21] going to that's going to come down
- [09:22] that's not a real reading so want to
- [09:27] show you how to load a sample the cool
- [09:28] way the less interesting way is using
- [09:32] this thing here you'll load your sample
- [09:35] on to a sample holder or pedestal like
- [09:37] this and the end of this rod will thread
- [09:39] into it and the rod will be inserted
- [09:42] into the microscope like that the
- [09:45] airlock will be evacuated and then you
- [09:46] push this red ball all the way in there
- [09:48] and then you unthread the sample some
- [09:50] sample stays in there and you can
- [09:52] retract this and pull it out but I want
- [09:55] to show you the hole inside of this so I
- [09:57] have to bring this up to atmosphere and
- [09:59] then it's going to slide out so to do
- [10:01] that we go down to you're on the vacuum
- [10:03] control and we can vent the gun or the
- [10:06] specimen chamber hammer event the
- [10:07] specimen chamber so I'll hit that valve
- [10:10] lv3 will open that flows nitrogen into
- [10:14] this chamber and then in a couple
- [10:16] minutes I'm gonna be able to draw that
- [10:17] out the computer is booting up here okay
- [10:21] there we go alright this guy is ready to
- [10:23] be drawn out
- [10:32] this is the stage here the sample will
- [10:36] fit right here and this is the XY table
- [10:40] that's the cash is that if you can pump
- [10:42] with that screen there and you can see
- [10:45] up there at the backscattered electron
- [10:47] detector and then to the right of that
- [10:49] is through the Faraday cage on the
- [10:51] secondary electron detector now we can
- [10:56] put a sample in so I have this one for a
- [10:58] parrot already this guy has a ton of
- [11:01] things on it it's got a bunch of bugs
- [11:03] and stuff as you can see that really so
- [11:11] this is got a bunch of bugs that I've
- [11:12] sputtered so they're conductive so you
- [11:15] can look at them under the microscope
- [11:16] it's also got a light bulb filament a
- [11:18] really really tiny gallium arsenide high
- [11:21] electron mobility RF transistor FET and
- [11:24] some really small medical chains and
- [11:28] devices and cool stuff like that so they
- [11:33] come over the microscope
- [11:36] and just slide it on here
- [11:41] make sure it's seated and now I can
- [11:45] close this
- [11:52] and if everything was working perfectly
- [11:53] I would be able to depress this button
- [11:58] and the chamber would automatically vent
- [12:00] itself but it's not working so instead
- [12:05] of doing that I have to come to the
- [12:06] vacuum panel here and I have to initiate
- [12:09] the roughing sequence manually so I have
- [12:11] to switch I had to flip switches v1b v4
- [12:14] and v6 and it's a bit over to manual and
- [12:18] now that's in a sucking I'm just pulling
- [12:23] there and it grabbed so now this chamber
- [12:26] is being roughed down by the mechanical
- [12:28] pump and we'll do the new on the vacuum
- [12:30] gauge start to come down in a minute and
- [12:32] I'll come back when Matt's rough down to
- [12:35] the point where I can start the
- [12:37] diffusion pump the diffusion pumps are
- [12:39] being heated right now the heater is not
- [12:41] all the way warmed up and gated by that
- [12:43] light and then I'll come back then and
- [12:47] we'll turn on that if your ship works ok
- [12:49] but the system is been rough down so
- [12:53] when I'm in here I'm going to connect
- [12:54] the diffusion pump to do that I'm going
- [12:56] to close valve v6 and b4 and I'm going
- [12:59] to leave v1 be open and open B 1 a and B
- [13:02] 2 and it's going to rough down for a
- [13:05] couple minutes
- [13:06] or rather evacuate to 1 a minus 4 for a
- [13:09] couple minutes really doesn't make that
- [13:10] long and once that's done I will open
- [13:14] the 7 which is the gate valve between
- [13:16] the gun and the specimen chambers and
- [13:18] then I can turn my electron beam on
- [13:20] saturate the filament and we are getting
- [13:22] some images then they can do which is
- [13:26] pretty nice rather than redoing all the
- [13:29] settings for gun alignment everything
- [13:30] like that every time I turn the computer
- [13:31] on or turn the microscope on I can load
- [13:34] and see the SCM parameters so system or
- [13:37] a couple days ago and I can load that on
- [13:41] to the microscope these are all my
- [13:43] settings
- [13:44] and I'm going to start loading in here
- [13:48] on the computer it just saved some time
- [13:53] I waiting for it to pump down and I got
- [13:57] bored so I thought I'd show you how I
- [13:58] prepare the samples this is my high
- [14:00] vacuum chamber and right now it's set up
- [14:02] for sputtering so over here I have some
- [14:05] gases I can flow argon into the chamber
- [14:08] via the mass flow controller very very
- [14:10] precisely and well first I have
- [14:13] activated with the turbo pump over there
- [14:14] and then once the blazing that slowed
- [14:16] down I can allow argon back into it and
- [14:17] make whatever partial pressure of argon
- [14:20] I walk and inside of it I have right
- [14:24] there that big stainless plate there is
- [14:26] where you put the sample you want a coat
- [14:28] and on top I have a plate of copper and
- [14:30] that's the target I get sputter down
- [14:32] onto it and big electrical fuse down
- [14:34] here those wires are too small for
- [14:38] sputtering right now I've got a few
- [14:40] plasma cleaning my sputtering supply
- [14:43] actually burnt out so I'd come over here
- [14:47] and the pressure is too high right now
- [14:48] so I can't sustain the plasma and if
- [14:50] energies of arcing in the chamber but I
- [14:53] can just go like this and turn that on
- [14:57] to few hundred volts and you can see the
- [15:00] plasma the chamber
- [15:06] [Music]
- [15:13] [Music]
- [15:17] we're all pumped down so I can go ahead
- [15:19] and turn the acceleration or pajama when
- [15:22] I turn that on except the 2080 right now
- [15:25] when I turn that on the meter here is
- [15:27] going to come up and that's showing the
- [15:28] emission current through the filament
- [15:31] I'll click this and I'll show the
- [15:32] forward current that we're spending too
- [15:34] so I just turned on the acceleration
- [15:37] voltage and the current voltage and
- [15:39] later you know and you'll see up on the
- [15:43] waveform monitor we actually have an
- [15:46] image so without even touching anything
- [15:48] else right now I can adjust that in
- [15:51] brightness and contrast an actual image
- [15:54] of what's going on in the chamber so I'm
- [15:57] not going to touch that right now I'm
- [15:59] going to quickly make sure that the
- [16:03] foliage is saturated and right now we're
- [16:05] putting on 6 about 70 micro amps out and
- [16:09] make sure that's saturated and I'm going
- [16:13] to align the gun on for children ship
- [16:15] and a couple of other things and then
- [16:17] we'll be ready to go
- [16:25] [Music]
- [16:50] in the tungsten filament as you go to
- [16:52] saturate it would be a first peek in a
- [16:53] second you when you're doing critical
- [16:55] work you want to write the second peak
- [16:57] that'll give you higher resolution with
- [16:58] your filament will burn out faster so
- [17:00] I'm gonna get the first peak right now
- [17:02] for lower clarity +5 we're assessing
- [17:06] around experience
- [17:27] it's very very quick
- [17:30] that
- [17:32] all right
- [17:34] just bring it a little bit closer here
- [17:37] and see what's going on so these are all
- [17:41] of the parts that are cited it the
- [17:46] computer has an awesome function we're
- [17:48] using this ball mouse here when you
- [17:51] going to the right menu you can use it
- [17:53] to actually move the stage so wash these
- [17:57] manipulators and they move the ball
- [17:59] mouth around pretty useful feature so we
- [18:07] can look around and I'll find some cool
- [18:09] stuff to look at
- [18:11] I'm sorry for these artifacts on the
- [18:13] screen here it's kind of hard to film
- [18:15] CRT but anyway this is the light bulb
- [18:20] filament I have a center dump on here we
- [18:24] look to wise little glass feed bag later
- [18:27] I'd add that
- [18:31] and then I can just operate in and the
- [18:34] background you're seeing here is the
- [18:36] double sniffing table using prepare the
- [18:37] sample its conductive carbon
- [18:44] these images are quite low quality
- [18:47] because we're very fast and of going on
- [18:50] here
- [18:50] let's look better yeah it looks a little
- [18:52] bit better so you can actually see even
- [18:56] in these lower quality skin you can see
- [18:58] lines across the pumpkin filament and
- [18:59] those are actually the tooling in
- [19:01] perfection and the dullness of the tool
- [19:04] that they use to create this element so
- [19:07] if I wanted to get a higher quality
- [19:09] image I would then do it a little bit of
- [19:12] a slower scan and then it would
- [19:14] integrate over multiple passes of the
- [19:17] electron beam and you get a much higher
- [19:19] resolution image that's pretty neat
- [19:24] looking back to a fast scan and it zoom
- [19:27] out a little bit and I'm gonna suppose
- [19:30] can that again and then what I'm happy
- [19:32] with the image I can then send it up to
- [19:35] the digital computer and then I could
- [19:38] then export it to a more modern computer
- [19:40] so I go to the imaging tab I take your
- [19:42] speed and it'll freeze the digital
- [19:46] monitor there and it'll send it over via
- [19:48] skuzzy cable to the ancient computer
- [19:56] and there we go we have the image we're
- [19:59] in auto brightness contrast if you look
- [20:02] around it's pretty cool and I can
- [20:05] imagine all executed with ruff diameter
- [20:07] of the wire is roughly thirty six point
- [20:10] eight six microns
- [20:12] and the diameter of the overall winding
- [20:19] almost 200 microns across it
- [20:26] here is a kick that's been sputtered
- [20:29] with copper kind of spooky
- [20:37] yeah pretty scary
- [20:44] this poppy thief
- [20:50] looks pretty neat
- [20:55] and here's the leg of some insect three
- [20:58] large insect I only know what what it
- [21:02] was though
- [21:06] those are the hairs on the leg of some
- [21:09] insects which I know yeah there you go
- [21:23] now if I wanted to actually grab really
- [21:25] high-resolution images the two things I
- [21:27] would use the first thing I would do is
- [21:29] I put the some woman at its absolute
- [21:30] saturation so that's the second peak I
- [21:33] would go over the aperture right there
- [21:34] and I would close that in right now
- [21:35] we're at aperture setting 3 which is a
- [21:37] pretty wide aperture so we're close late
- [21:39] in that would physically it was a
- [21:40] smaller electron beam then I would lower
- [21:42] the probe current which further gives
- [21:45] you a smaller beam I would make sure the
- [21:48] acceleration voltage is maxed out at 30
- [21:50] kV then I would redo a gun alignment for
- [21:53] tilt and shift and I would also Center
- [21:56] the aperture by engaging the wobbler
- [21:58] here and it's actually pretty well
- [22:00] centered right now so that's all for my
- [22:06] scanning electron microscope video
- [22:09] please check out my website and posting
- [22:11] a lot more pictures from this and really
- [22:13] having a lot of fun with it so thanks
- [22:16] for watching and I hope you learned
- [22:17] something and if you do too do decide to
- [22:20] grab one of these for yourself and put
- [22:22] it in your garage best of luck and have
- [22:26] fun search around eBay
