- [00:00] SPEAKER: Gemini 3 Flash can
handle a huge number of function
- [00:03] calls reliably at low latency.
- [00:06] In this function
calling challenge,
- [00:07] it must successfully sequence
tasks to prepare dishes.
- [00:11] Let's cook some ramen.
- [00:13] We start with a hundred
ingredients and a hundred tools,
- [00:16] which the model has to
reason across simultaneously.
- [00:19] Each kitchen tool is a
separate function call.
- [00:23] There are three agents
powered by Gemini 3 Flash.
- [00:27] The cooking agent triggers
the function calls.
- [00:30] It plans ahead by combining raw
ingredients to use later on.
- [00:34] New combinations get added
to the ingredients list.
- [00:39] Each new combination
is being generated live
- [00:41] by the alchemy agent
with super-low latency.
- [00:45] You can imagine this
function calling setup
- [00:47] working in any environment
with multiple agents
- [00:49] and a large number of tools
that the model can use.
- [00:53] OK, looking at the
Kitchen Log, we
- [00:55] can see the ramen is
starting to come together.
- [00:57] And it looks like the
verification agent is
- [00:59] happy with the final outcome.
- [01:02] Check out this Function Calling
Kitchen demo at the link
- [01:05] or build your own with Gemini.
