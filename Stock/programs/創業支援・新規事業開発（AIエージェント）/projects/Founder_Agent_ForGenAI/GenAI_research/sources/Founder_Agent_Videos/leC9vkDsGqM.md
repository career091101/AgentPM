- [00:00] Data teams spend more time wrangling data and maintaining pipelines than delivering insights. Agentic
- [00:05] AI can change that. Data engineering today is very complicated and siloed. The data lives
- [00:12] across different clouds, operational warehouses, data
- [00:18] lakes, as well as APIs. And each of these
- [00:25] systems comes with its own set of constraints. Additionally, when data engineering teams are
- [00:30] building pipelines, the engineers often depend on a mix of schedule jobs,
- [00:40] stored procedures, complicated
- [00:47] scripts, as well as transformation logic. And each of
- [00:53] these work together just to keep the data flowing. Sometimes when a single schema change or column
- [01:00] rename happens on a source system, this can trigger hours of debugging and retesting. And when
- [01:06] new requests for data keep coming in, much of the team's effort goes into maintenance rather than
- [01:11] building new capabilities. Now imagine an agent built specifically for data integration that can
- [01:18] handle all of the steps a data engineer would take. First, the agents can understand not just
- [01:24] one, but all of the data sources in your system.
- [01:32] And this spans different structures of data, whether it's relational data, unstructured data,
- [01:38] such as documents, or data from API. And these data sources can also be across different premises,
- [01:45] such as cloud or on-prem. Secondly, the agents also understand the metadata as well as the
- [01:51] entity relationships. And this is important so
- [01:58] that the agents and AI can understand the different business terms and meanings behind the
- [02:05] data itself. And then lastly, the agents can also handle the
- [02:11] complexity of creating a data pipeline with multiple joins, transformations, logic and
- [02:18] business rules.
- [02:27] Underlying all of this, the agents can figure out the best mechanism to deliver that data, whether
- [02:33] it is through ETL, ELT,
- [02:40] change data capture, which is replication, as well as streaming
- [02:49] or unstructured integration.
- [02:56] Moreover, an integration agent can fit into an engineering team's entire workflow, from
- [03:02] requests with ticketing systems that feed directly to the agents themselves. And
- [03:10] when a data integration agent builds a pipeline, it can also determine which targets
- [03:17] to feed the data to. How do these AI agents work? An
- [03:24] agentic system utilizes large language models, and these large language models
- [03:30] help to parse the natural language requests and intent from users and translate them into
- [03:36] structured actions. Reinforcement learning is also used so that these agents can improve their
- [03:43] plans over time by successfully rewarding the pipeline runs that are completed. And
- [03:50] additionally, these AI agents don't just generate text. They also caught APIs with tool calling.
- [03:59] And tool calling helps so that the agents can utilize applications and systems that are
- [04:06] needed to connect to data sources, understand the metadata and carry out the transformations.
- [04:13] And working together, these agents can produce and execute fully working pipelines without the
- [04:20] manual work of hand-coded ETL that bogs down data teams today. What are the potential use cases of
- [04:27] AI agents for data integration? There are a few practical examples. The first is declarative
- [04:32] pipeline authoring.
- [04:42] Using this, engineers or analysts can describe the outcome that they desire and the
- [04:48] agent will be able to create the full data pipeline. The second is that business users will
- [04:55] be able to self-service their data.
- [05:04] With this approach, analysts can request or create new data sets with self-service, resulting in
- [05:10] improved accuracy, as well as faster time to insights.
- [05:23] And then lastly, AI agents can also help with data quality and observability.
- [05:35] The agents would be able to detect column changes or type
- [05:42] mismatches early and propose fixes before jobs fail. Continuous checks for
- [05:48] anomalies, automatic backfills and rerouting around failed data sources will help to keep data
- [05:54] trustworthy for downstream uses in AI systems. Agentic AI for data integration solves
- [06:01] many challenges and generates value for data engineering teams. First, AI agents generate value
- [06:08] for engineers. For data engineers, this means
- [06:14] that they get to work on fewer repetitive fixes and have more time to focus on complex
- [06:20] integration, as well as strategic work. Secondly, AI agents help business users.
- [06:32] Business users are able to get faster access to reliable data without long handoffs.
- [06:39] And then third, AI agents help with data for AI.
- [06:49] Agents help to generate cleaner, fresher pipeline that pipelines that feed analytics and machine
- [06:55] learning models with less friction and greater speed and accuracy. Ultimately,
- [07:02] AI agents can intelligently solve problems in data integration, helping to plan, monitor and
- [07:08] adapt to data challenges so data arrives where it needs to be with the quality and timeliness that
- [07:14] your workloads require. As the as these AI agents mature, data integration moves from a patchwork
- [07:21] of jobs and custom logic to an adaptive, goal-driven process ready to support the next
- [07:27] generation of AI.
