- [00:00] If you want to start building AI agents
- [00:03] for real world use cases and deploying
- [00:06] them on the cloud or using them for your
- [00:09] own projects on your local desktop, this
- [00:12] is the video for you. These are the
- [00:15] seven best
- [00:17] agent development kits available for you
- [00:20] to start trying and using today. So
- [00:23] number one is this Google agent
- [00:26] development kit. I've spoken about this
- [00:27] before. The Google Agent Development Kit
- [00:29] is open source. Of course, it's backed
- [00:31] by Google. It's Python first. It
- [00:33] integrates seamlessly with Google Vertex
- [00:36] AI and the AI garden. So, you can see
- [00:39] the AI garden. You've got pre-built
- [00:41] customizable blueprints and source code.
- [00:43] Got these tools you can connect to. It
- [00:45] offers deterministic guard rails for
- [00:47] orchestration controls and you can use
- [00:50] other LLMs with light LLM. It does
- [00:54] support OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, but by
- [00:56] default, of course, it works with the
- [00:58] Gemini models and developers appreciate
- [01:01] the Google ADK because it has excellent
- [01:03] documentation. It's got really good
- [01:05] documentation. And if you're anything
- [01:07] like me, it's not that you have to sit
- [01:09] down and study every part of the
- [01:11] documentation, but the fact that you can
- [01:12] give the URL for the documentation to
- [01:15] the AI and query it, question it, that's
- [01:17] the main thing. So, good documentation
- [01:19] is an absolute must. That's why this ADK
- [01:22] is at the top of my list. But some agent
- [01:24] types and workflow interfaces do seem a
- [01:26] bit over complicated for simple use
- [01:28] cases. It's not a huge problem. It's
- [01:30] just something I've noticed. Number two
- [01:32] is Crew AI. So Crew AI offers role-based
- [01:36] collaborative agent crews with
- [01:38] self-organization and scripted flows. So
- [01:41] you get a modular multi- aent
- [01:42] orchestration. So kind of like the
- [01:44] Claude sub agents, you can define
- [01:46] different roles. So researcher, writer,
- [01:49] marketer. It supports both open-ended
- [01:51] and explicit workflow scripting, shared
- [01:53] memory modules for collaboration, and
- [01:56] uses Python functions and API
- [01:58] integration by default. Crew AI is also
- [02:00] quite popular due to its intuitive
- [02:02] design for complex teamwork
- [02:04] applications. It also has a massive
- [02:06] open-source community. Now, the next one
- [02:08] on the list is Autogen and Autogen
- [02:10] offers a conversation ccentric multi-
- [02:13] aent collaboration. Some of the key
- [02:15] features are the event-driven
- [02:16] asynchronous architecture, the
- [02:18] extensible agent personas and inter
- [02:20] agent communication, tool integration
- [02:22] and code execution within agent loops,
- [02:25] and then human in the loop support.
- [02:27] Autogen is best for simulating realistic
- [02:30] human-like meetings, debates, critique
- [02:33] sessions. It's also strong in R&D and
- [02:35] analytics. Now, the next one on the list
- [02:37] is Langchain. And lang chain is probably
- [02:40] the most popular LLM workflow or agent
- [02:43] framework for custom tool chains. Some
- [02:45] of the key features of this framework
- [02:46] are extensive integrations with vector
- [02:49] DBs, APIs, external tools, multi- aent
- [02:52] orchestration and LLM to LLM workflows,
- [02:55] flexible abstractions and concurrent
- [02:57] workflows. And Langchain is best used
- [02:59] for custom production grade AI agent
- [03:01] ecosystems or general use. So that's why
- [03:04] it's quite popular. I find that most
- [03:06] businesses, if they know anything about
- [03:08] AI agents, they tend to request lang
- [03:11] chain. So that's something to keep in
- [03:12] mind if you're exploring these different
- [03:14] frameworks. What do people prefer and
- [03:16] why? So lang chain great general use
- [03:18] agent framework. The next one on the
- [03:20] list is Lindy. So Lindy is a no code
- [03:23] business focused platform. The first
- [03:25] thing you probably notice is the UI. It
- [03:27] looks a lot like the lovables, the
- [03:29] tempos, the bolt news of the internet
- [03:33] world. So that should tell you a bit
- [03:34] about it. No code, business focused. You
- [03:37] don't need to be a developer or have
- [03:40] experience with machine learning or
- [03:41] anything like that to start building
- [03:43] with it. You've got the visual drag and
- [03:45] drop pipeline designer and builder. And
- [03:47] it's got hundreds of out of the box
- [03:49] integrations. WordPress, Gmail, Slack,
- [03:52] Salesforce, Google Sheets, Zoom. You can
- [03:55] see all the logos there, but tons and
- [03:57] tons of out of the box integrations. And
- [03:59] then you've got agent swarms for
- [04:01] executing many automations in parallel.
- [04:04] So parallelizing your different
- [04:05] workflows. Very very important if you
- [04:08] want to be efficient. And this is best
- [04:10] for entrepreneurs and business users
- [04:12] launching agents without coding. So that
- [04:14] will be at the top of my list for no
- [04:16] code. The next one on the list is the
- [04:18] Open AI agents SDK. And this is an
- [04:20] official Python toolkit for robust agent
- [04:23] orchestration using OpenAI's latest
- [04:25] models and API. So you've got the simple
- [04:28] Python abstractions, agents, handoffs,
- [04:30] guardrails, sessions, schema validation,
- [04:34] embedded tracing and debugging. You can
- [04:36] plug in Python functions as tools, so
- [04:38] it's designed for fast experimentation
- [04:41] and deployment, fast prototyping. It's
- [04:43] enterprise ready and supports multi-
- [04:45] aent and multi-tool workflows. The next
- [04:47] one is Lang Graph and this is a
- [04:50] framework. If you if I go back to Lang
- [04:52] Chain over here, you've got different
- [04:54] frameworks. You've got Langraph and Lang
- [04:55] Chain. So, Lang graph as the name
- [04:58] suggests is a graph-based agent
- [05:00] orchestration specifically uses DAGs for
- [05:03] agent workflows and it features visual
- [05:05] workflow design, deep execution control,
- [05:08] fine- grain management of agent
- [05:09] dependencies and error paths and it's
- [05:12] ideal for highly structured multi- aent
- [05:15] logic and decision tree style
- [05:17] automation. So, this is for advanced use
- [05:20] cases, but it does have a steeper
- [05:22] learning curve compared to some of the
- [05:25] other agents mentioned. And honestly,
- [05:28] the documentation
- [05:30] is a bit lacking in comparison. But in
- [05:32] any case, you're still going to take
- [05:34] your documentation, give it to the AI,
- [05:36] ask it questions, use the internet,
- [05:38] figure things out yourself, test it out.
- [05:41] But yeah, those are the top seven agent
- [05:43] development kits to start using today to
- [05:45] build and deploy real world AI agents. I
- [05:49] hope you found this video useful. If you
