- [00:00] Yesterday, OpenAI stepped into the web
- [00:02] browser Thunderdome with the release of
- [00:04] Atlas, their new AI powered browser
- [00:06] built around chat GPT. And although I
- [00:09] had anniversary plans, I imagine this is
- [00:11] just how John Mir felt when he said,
- [00:13] "The comments are calling and I must
- [00:14] go." The idea for Atlas is pretty
- [00:16] simple. The Fort Chromium and Vibe add
- [00:18] chat GPT into it as an assistant that
- [00:21] can see, remember, and help with
- [00:23] anything you need. Like imagine you
- [00:24] wanted to eat food. To do that, you'd
- [00:26] usually have to go to the Door Dash app
- [00:28] and go through the work of ordering it
- [00:29] yourself like a prehistoric hunter
- [00:31] gatherer. But now with Atlas, you can
- [00:33] just tell it exactly what you want to
- [00:35] eat, and it'll do the work for you.
- [00:37] Augustus Gloop himself couldn't have
- [00:38] designed a better experience. Of course,
- [00:40] Atlas is only available on Mac, but
- [00:42] thankfully, my neighbor is an unemployed
- [00:44] JavaScript developer, so I was able to
- [00:46] borrow his to check it out. It is
- [00:48] October 22nd, 2025, and you're watching
- [00:51] the Code Report. As a believer of the
- [00:52] free and open web, there's nothing I'd
- [00:54] enjoy more than to hear that OpenAI
- [00:56] pushed Codeex to its limits and built a
- [00:58] new engine and browser from scratch. But
- [01:00] like almost all new browsers lately,
- [01:02] Atlas is just a fork of Chromium,
- [01:04] Google's free and open- source web
- [01:06] browser. According to the keynote,
- [01:08] OpenAI didn't want it to just feel like
- [01:10] Chrome with Chat GBT bolted on. And
- [01:12] after playing with it for a little bit,
- [01:13] I can confidently say that's exactly how
- [01:16] it feels. Sam Alman even told me they
- [01:18] completely reinvented the way a browser
- [01:20] is used. But I think the reality is that
- [01:22] they mostly just copied Perplexity
- [01:23] Comet. Despite that, there are still
- [01:25] some cool parts to it. Because it can
- [01:27] see everything you do, it's able to use
- [01:29] your browsing history as context when
- [01:31] you ask it questions. Now, I know that
- [01:33] sounds like a horrible violation of your
- [01:34] privacy, but you are able to control
- [01:36] what it remembers and delete certain
- [01:38] memories if you need to. And as you saw
- [01:40] earlier with the Door Dash order, agent
- [01:42] mode lets chat GPT take actions on your
- [01:44] behalf. It does feel a bit like watching
- [01:46] a disabled pirate try to use a mouse for
- [01:48] the first time. But as I told my wife on
- [01:50] our honeymoon, the experience improves
- [01:52] with practice. But of course, Agentic
- [01:54] powered browsers don't have the best
- [01:56] track record when it comes to privacy or
- [01:58] security. Earlier this year, a team at
- [02:00] Brave was able to successfully
- [02:01] orchestrate a prompt injection in
- [02:03] Perplexity's Comet AI browser. But by
- [02:05] embedding malicious instructions inside
- [02:07] of an image that would get triggered
- [02:09] when a screenshot was taken of it and
- [02:11] analyzed by the model. And that same
- [02:12] team discovered that Fellow, which coins
- [02:14] itself as the world's first agentic
- [02:16] browser, was also vulnerable to a prompt
- [02:19] injection simply by instructing the
- [02:20] model to visit a website with the
- [02:22] malicious instructions. Because your
- [02:24] browser usually contains highly
- [02:26] sensitive cookies and data, the team at
- [02:27] Brave's ultimate takeaway was that
- [02:29] indirect prompt injection is not an
- [02:31] isolated issue, but a systemic challenge
- [02:34] facing the entire category of AI powered
- [02:36] browsers. It was Benjamin Franklin who
- [02:38] famously said that those who would give
- [02:40] up essential liberty to purchase a
- [02:42] little temporary safety deserve neither
- [02:44] liberty nor safety. But old Benjamin
- [02:46] Unbutton was always down for a good
- [02:48] time. And I'm pretty sure even he'd be
- [02:49] tempted to trade in his entire digital
- [02:51] privacy and security for an easier way
- [02:53] to order Taco Bell. Like the new flaming
- [02:55] hot colon prolapser grilled cheese
- [02:57] burrito available for a limited time at
- [02:59] participating US Taco Bell locations.
- [03:02] But if you want to avoid this temptation
- [03:03] altogether, another browser that's being
- [03:05] worked on is Ladybird. Unlike the
- [03:07] others, it's fully independent and
- [03:09] recreating both the engine and browser
- [03:11] from scratch without using code from any
- [03:13] other existing browser. It's an
- [03:15] incredibly ambitious project, but they
- [03:17] just recently passed the 90% threshold
- [03:19] on web platform tests, which makes them
- [03:21] eligible to be an alternative browser
- [03:23] engine on iOS. But though Ladybird
- [03:25] doesn't have any AI aspirations, every
- [03:28] developer and company out there is
- [03:29] trying to build the next big AI product.
- [03:32] But the hard truth is that your LLM is
- [03:34] basically worthless without a good
- [03:35] search engine, which is why you need to
- [03:37] check out Melee Search, the sponsor of
- [03:39] today's video. It's a restful search API
- [03:41] that understands user intent and returns
- [03:44] relevant results in milliseconds. That
- [03:46] means your app's AI features actually
- [03:48] feel intelligent instead of the typical
- [03:50] vague AI sloth. The search is hybrid,
- [03:52] semantic, and multimodal, which allows
- [03:54] it to pull rich context from any data
- [03:56] type. And it has over 53,000 GitHub
- [03:59] stars with developers appreciating how
- [04:01] you can drop it into any text stack and
- [04:03] then instantly scale up to millions of
- [04:05] searches. Try out Melee Search Cloud for
- [04:07] free for 2 months using the code fire
- [04:09] ship at the link below. This has been
- [04:11] the code report. Thanks for watching and
- [04:13] I will see you in the next one.
