- [00:00] Murray Webb, a senior machine learning
- [00:01] architect at PH data. The products and
- [00:03] services that we're using to support um
- [00:06] our AWS roadmap and strategy are mainly
- [00:08] around um Amazon Bedrock uh strands as
- [00:12] our agentic framework and agent core to
- [00:15] productionalize those assets. Um so the
- [00:17] foundation layer is bedrock do a lot of
- [00:19] model routing and things of that nature.
- [00:20] The framework is strange. Generally
- [00:22] speaking, we're push making a big push
- [00:23] into that. And then the uh the
- [00:25] production layer is Asian core and then
- [00:27] everything that within AWS is the
- [00:29] ecosystem. AWS is paramount to our
- [00:31] growth and to our innovation. We think
- [00:32] Amazon's just their own road map in
- [00:34] particular. Every, you know, every
- [00:36] summit that they have, we're watching,
- [00:37] we're learning. Um we're taking courses.
- [00:39] We have 250 certifications inside of
- [00:41] AWS. We're very proud of that. Um as
- [00:43] well as uh we're incredibly hyped on on
- [00:46] on the Agentic services that AWS is
- [00:48] rolling out. [music] um as well as some
- [00:50] the old school services that they stand
- [00:51] on top of. So we are full in on AWS. AWS
- [00:55] helps PH data uh be more interesting to
- [00:57] customers. They allow us to sort of
- [00:59] stand on the cutting edge without
- [01:00] falling all the way over and really
- [01:01] balance on the foundation of what Amazon
- [01:03] is.
