- [00:00] Okay, so OpenAI has just had their
- [00:03] launch for ChatGpt Atlas and this is
- [00:07] basically their launch of a browser or
- [00:10] rather their reskinning of the Chromium
- [00:13] browser from Google. They're not the
- [00:15] first ones to do this. Earlier in the
- [00:18] year, we had Perplexity do the same
- [00:20] thing with Comet and they basically
- [00:21] launched a browser with almost identical
- [00:24] features to what we've seen come out
- [00:27] today from OpenAI. And I got to be
- [00:30] honest that if anything I think perhaps
- [00:32] the perplexity one is a little bit more
- [00:35] interesting of where they're going and
- [00:37] the kind of things that they're doing.
- [00:39] But OpenAI is also following on from
- [00:42] Anthropic launching as a Chrome
- [00:45] extension about a month and a half ago.
- [00:47] Now the key thing with all of these is
- [00:50] that they realize the power of a
- [00:51] browser. And don't be mistaken, we're
- [00:54] seeing a battle for getting people to
- [00:57] change their browser. And if you're
- [00:59] going to get significant market share in
- [01:01] this answer engine game, you need to
- [01:04] have your own browser. You don't want to
- [01:06] be having your users constantly
- [01:08] accessing all your services through a
- [01:11] Google Chrome browser. So both
- [01:14] Perplexity and Chat Gvt have gone the
- [01:17] way of using Chromium which makes the
- [01:20] most sense rather than having to develop
- [01:22] a browser from scratch. It gives them
- [01:24] whole platform that they can make use of
- [01:27] already. They can import all your
- [01:28] bookmarks. They can do all that kind of
- [01:30] thing. So let's go through the key
- [01:32] features that they basically put in
- [01:34] here. So the first thing is this now
- [01:36] just becomes your default way to
- [01:38] interact with chat GBT that it's there
- [01:41] rather than you having to open a
- [01:42] separate app or a tab in your browser.
- [01:46] You've got this where you can actually
- [01:47] use this. But more than this, they've
- [01:50] rolled out what they're calling ask chat
- [01:52] GPT. And this is where you can have a
- [01:56] side popin where you can chat about the
- [01:59] content that you've got on the page.
- [02:01] Basically, it's just pulling in the
- [02:03] content of the page as context. You can
- [02:06] then just chat with it. This is not
- [02:09] really that new. People have done Chrome
- [02:11] extensions that have done this kind of
- [02:13] thing. You can actually do more fancy
- [02:15] stuff if you're doing a Chrome extension
- [02:17] where you could have it customize
- [02:19] exactly like what you want. You go to a
- [02:21] page, it just automatically summarizes
- [02:23] stuff. And I think that the sort of
- [02:25] whole idea where this is going to really
- [02:28] get some traction is around browser
- [02:32] memory that if they've been watching you
- [02:35] go to a whole bunch of different sites,
- [02:37] they'll be able to remind you when you
- [02:39] ask things like what was the site I was
- [02:41] looking at yesterday that had an article
- [02:43] like this. That's the kind of thing
- [02:45] where this ask chat GBT and the browser
- [02:48] memory stuff is going to become really
- [02:50] powerful. The other big feature that
- [02:52] they've introduced, similar to what
- [02:55] Perplexity has done, is the whole idea
- [02:57] of having an agent running for you. You
- [03:00] can see in this example here that when
- [03:03] you put it into agent mode, it has the
- [03:05] ability to go off and find things for
- [03:08] you and do tasks for you as well. Now,
- [03:12] in my experience of testing it, I've
- [03:14] found this to be sort of mixed on both
- [03:17] ChatBT Atlas and Comet. Not to mention
- [03:21] that on all of these services, this ends
- [03:23] up being really slow and tedious if
- [03:27] you're actually sitting there watching
- [03:29] it do something. The last main feature
- [03:31] that ChatgBT Atlas has actually launched
- [03:34] with is this ability to just insert uh
- [03:38] text wherever you are. They're calling
- [03:40] this cursor chat. And this is basically
- [03:43] inline text generation where you could
- [03:45] say, "Okay, here's my email. please
- [03:48] reply to this email for me. And I think
- [03:50] this is something that a lot of people
- [03:52] will like and actually could end up
- [03:54] being the killer feature of this is that
- [03:57] it's often a pain to copy something
- [04:00] across to Chachi BT or Claude or Gemini,
- [04:04] get the answer, and then copy it back.
- [04:06] So having this very quick inline text
- [04:09] generation where you can say, "Hey,
- [04:11] write me a response to this email is
- [04:14] probably going to be one of the key sort
- [04:15] of features for this." Now, they do make
- [04:18] the point that they've got a lot of
- [04:20] security and privacy controls in here.
- [04:24] So that you can allow Chachi PT to see
- [04:27] things. You can actually run the agent
- [04:29] tasks either logged in or not logged in.
- [04:32] I do like that feature a lot. It does
- [04:34] seem to be a cool thing they've added.
- [04:36] My guess is that is probably enough to
- [04:38] at least get people trying this out. So,
- [04:41] you can see here they're constantly
- [04:42] trying to reassure people that you're in
- [04:44] control. You're the one who actually
- [04:46] does this. So, like I mentioned, the
- [04:48] browser itself is good. I did find it
- [04:51] funny watching the launch that Samman
- [04:54] talked about that this is just a great
- [04:56] browser all round. It's smooth. It's
- [04:58] very quick and nice to use. Well, that's
- [05:02] not surprising because it basically is
- [05:04] Chromium, right? It's the same core
- [05:07] engine and system that is being used for
- [05:11] most the browsers that are out there
- [05:13] nowadays. Anyway, let's jump in and look
- [05:16] at how you can get set up with this and
- [05:17] have a quick play with it.
- [05:20] Okay, to get started with Atlas, you can
- [05:23] just come over to chatgpt.com/atlas
- [05:27] and you'll be able to see here where you
- [05:29] can download it. This is currently only
- [05:31] available for MacOSS.
- [05:34] It it's not available for Windows yet,
- [05:36] but my guess is that we'll see it come
- [05:38] along very soon. And it's also going to
- [05:40] be really interesting to see how long
- [05:41] before they have a mobile version of
- [05:44] this as well. So in here, we can see the
- [05:47] actual features. Agent is one of the big
- [05:50] things that they're pushing in here.
- [05:52] This seems to be using their same setup
- [05:56] that they've done for agents before,
- [05:59] like the computer use agents before,
- [06:01] except now it's running locally on your
- [06:04] machine as opposed to running on a
- [06:06] machine in the cloud. Actually turns out
- [06:08] to be a lot cheaper for OpenAI to do
- [06:10] that. So that makes a lot of sense.
- [06:12] Okay. Once you've got it installed, it's
- [06:14] going to ask you, do you want to import
- [06:16] data from another browser? I'm going to
- [06:18] skip this. I don't want OpenAI sucking
- [06:21] up all my browser information.
- [06:25] And we can see that this is where the
- [06:27] memory feature is really coming in,
- [06:28] right? They're going to have things like
- [06:30] where you can turn on browser memories,
- [06:32] make your cursor a collaborator. I'm not
- [06:35] going to set it as my default. It's
- [06:36] interesting that if you do set it as
- [06:38] your default browser, you boost your
- [06:40] Chat GBT limits. As you can see, I'm now
- [06:44] done. It's telling me I joined Chatyppt
- [06:47] 1,200 days ago, which I think is more
- [06:49] than 3 years and it's only been out for
- [06:51] that. And I joined Atlas 2 minutes ago.
- [06:54] All right, let's jump in and have a play
- [06:56] with it. You can see that we could just
- [06:58] do the normal sort of things of go to
- [07:01] amazon.com.
- [07:03] Here I'm going to have Amazon not liking
- [07:06] the fact that I'm using a chat GPT
- [07:07] browser. And then you can see I've got
- [07:10] access to the sort of inline chatgpt
- [07:13] here. I can ask it, okay, go and
- [07:15] actually find something for me. Now, I
- [07:19] didn't turn on the agent. So, you can
- [07:21] see it's thinking about what to do. So,
- [07:24] now it's asking me, okay, would I like
- [07:26] to start using the agent? I'll say yes.
- [07:28] And then now I've got this agent mode
- [07:31] may introduce risks. This is obviously a
- [07:33] key part of this. I'm going to start as
- [07:35] logged out. Now, it's taking over my
- [07:38] browser and using it in agent mode. And
- [07:41] we can see that this because it's kind
- [07:42] of running over the top of the actual
- [07:45] browser as well. At any point I can take
- [07:47] control or stop it. That said, I'd still
- [07:51] be quite reluctant to use this with my
- [07:53] credit card logged in etc. So one of the
- [07:56] things with many of the agent browser or
- [08:00] technically these are called sort of
- [08:01] computer use agents is that they're very
- [08:04] slow, right? You're sort of sitting
- [08:06] around waiting for ages for them to be
- [08:09] able to run things. So they're really
- [08:11] the kind of thing that you want to just
- [08:13] run in the background and then leave it.
- [08:16] So we can see that it's gone off. It's
- [08:18] found some stuff. Interestingly, it
- [08:21] hasn't changed my browser window. So I
- [08:24] can't see what it's actually found. And
- [08:27] it doesn't look like I can click into
- [08:30] the product or anything like that. Has
- [08:32] it given me a new tab? No, it's just
- [08:34] given me another Amazon tab. That one I
- [08:37] would say is a bit of a fail. So you can
- [08:39] see when we click into agent mode, we've
- [08:42] got the ability to run that logged in or
- [08:44] logged out. I do think that's a really
- [08:46] cool thing they've put in here. On the
- [08:48] whole, this is just more of the same
- [08:52] stuff that we've seen. I'm not seeing
- [08:54] anything hugely interesting. Okay, so
- [08:56] I'm running it now in agent mode. I'm
- [08:59] asking it to go and find out about the
- [09:01] new James Bond movie. I'm curious to see
- [09:03] like what can it actually find? Where
- [09:05] does it look? That kind of thing. Don't
- [09:07] forget there are a lot of sites now that
- [09:10] are blocking OpenAI. So, how is that
- [09:13] going to work? If you're using the
- [09:15] OpenAI browser and you're trying to go
- [09:19] to some of these sites, are we going to
- [09:21] see that this browser is just not going
- [09:24] to work on certain sites or not? Okay,
- [09:28] we can see that it went off and did some
- [09:30] stuff. Now, I didn't actually see where
- [09:32] it went. So, it's come back with
- [09:34] information. The information I think is
- [09:37] probably okay. We've got some nice
- [09:39] different citations. Really no different
- [09:42] than what we would have in chatgpt.com.
- [09:45] That is interesting. We can see if we
- [09:48] click here the different search results.
- [09:50] We can see different images really
- [09:53] trying to basically just sort of become
- [09:55] I guess a search engine in here. It is
- [09:58] kind of funny that for videos everything
- [10:00] seems to be pretty much YouTube most of
- [10:01] the time. And we can see that, okay,
- [10:04] they've gone and gotten some news
- [10:07] results that relate to this in some way.
- [10:09] So, just to finish up, this is clearly
- [10:12] still very much early days with Atlas.
- [10:15] I'm actually kind of surprised that they
- [10:17] rush this out, but my guess is that over
- [10:19] time we will see this get a lot better.
- [10:22] If you don't have access to something
- [10:24] like Claude Chrome or you don't have
- [10:27] access to perplexity, etc. I know they
- [10:30] were tightly controlling access. This is
- [10:33] now open to pretty much everyone. And
- [10:36] the agent stuff I think you need to have
- [10:37] a paid account, but everything else you
- [10:39] can use for free. It's going to be
- [10:41] interesting to see, do people adopt this
- [10:44] or not? And it's also going to be
- [10:46] interesting to see between now and the
- [10:48] end of the year, what is going to be
- [10:50] Google's sort of answer to this. Are we
- [10:53] going to see a lot of these kind of
- [10:54] features just be automatically
- [10:56] integrated into Chrome? Google obviously
- [10:59] doesn't have the antitrust issues around
- [11:02] Chrome now that they did perhaps a
- [11:04] couple of months ago. So, let me know in
- [11:06] the comments what you think. I'm kind of
- [11:08] on the fence. I'm not sure I necessarily
- [11:10] would be using this as my main browser
- [11:12] dayto-day. I would like to see what else
- [11:14] they're going to add to this to actually
- [11:16] sort of empower it. It could be
- [11:18] interesting to see how the computer use
- [11:20] agents in this are actually working and
- [11:23] be able to get a sense of what they're
- [11:26] doing in there. if you're trying to
- [11:27] build agents yourself, etc. Anyway, as

- [11:35] for now.
