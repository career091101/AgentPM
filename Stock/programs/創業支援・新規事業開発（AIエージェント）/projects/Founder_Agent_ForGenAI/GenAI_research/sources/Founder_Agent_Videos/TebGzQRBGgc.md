- [00:00] Next up, we have a fireside chat with
- [00:02] Desiree from Walmart being moderated by
- [00:04] Susan who's with Microsoft. Hey, hey,
- [00:07] I'm Susan Linger.
- [00:09] This is Desi Gossby. We're going to go
- [00:11] enterprise now.
- [00:13] Um, thank you so much for joining. So,
- [00:16] Desi has this incredible role at
- [00:18] Walmart. Um, I'm going to start with a
- [00:21] little bit of context, right? Because I
- [00:23] think we do need to go back up to the
- [00:24] 50,000 foot level and just set some
- [00:27] context. So Walmart is an organization
- [00:30] that of course everybody knows that has
- [00:33] an extraordinary long reputation and
- [00:36] particularly around process. Um and at
- [00:39] the same time we find ourselves in this
- [00:40] moment where I don't know what what you
- [00:42] all think but like I'm taking bets on
- [00:45] how many times we all say vibe coding
- [00:46] today. Um this is my this is my one. I'm
- [00:50] probably not going to say it again. Um
- [00:51] but I do I'm not going to say it at all.
- [00:53] She's not going to say it at all either.
- [00:54] Okay. So I want to start Desi with um
- [00:58] you know given where you sit in the
- [00:59] organization you have seen a lot of
- [01:02] change both in the industry and also at
- [01:06] Walmart and so what does this moment
- [01:09] mean to you?
- [01:11] Yeah I it's um you know for for Walmart
- [01:14] and and and in in general it it's it's a
- [01:17] pretty significant moment. We see this
- [01:19] as uh a pretty um big inflection point
- [01:22] very similar to uh to the internet. And
- [01:26] um you know what we mean by that is
- [01:27] really when we take a step back it's as
- [01:30] profound as um uh in terms of how it is
- [01:34] that we're actually going to operate,
- [01:36] how it is that we actually you know do
- [01:37] work. Uh but the core principles around
- [01:40] you know how how we're going to apply uh
- [01:42] you know this this new moment um really
- [01:44] isn't going to change. But um but it is
- [01:48] a significant uh inflection point and it
- [01:50] it's permeating everything it is that we
- [01:52] do. Uh but at the end of the day the way
- [01:55] that we look at it is um you know we we
- [01:57] always start with our customers and our
- [01:59] members and really understanding how
- [02:01] it's going to impact them. We look at
- [02:03] how it's going to impact uh our our
- [02:05] operations. We look at how it'll impact
- [02:07] how it is that we actually do
- [02:08] development and you know what we call
- [02:10] our ways of working. it's going to
- [02:12] permeate all parts of of of what it is
- [02:15] that we do. Uh and um you know with that
- [02:18] you know we're looking at it in terms of
- [02:19] how it is that we actually take this
- [02:22] take what it is that you know AI has
- [02:23] always been part of our DNA as a company
- [02:25] but take this and how do we take the
- [02:27] things that we do uh you know to the
- [02:28] next level. Walmart has always been um
- [02:31] what we call a um an EDLC EDLP company.
- [02:35] And what that means is that we are very
- [02:37] focused on how it is that we drive
- [02:40] everyday, you know, low cost uh so that
- [02:42] we can provide everyday low prices for
- [02:44] our customers. And that means that we
- [02:46] have to be incredibly rigorous in terms
- [02:48] of the process that we use uh across the
- [02:51] board in terms of delivering product,
- [02:53] you know, to our customers that that
- [02:55] they love. uh and making sure that we
- [02:58] are uh eliminating anything that's you
- [03:00] know u manual work um using automation
- [03:03] wherever it is that we can uh and um and
- [03:07] and delivering the best experience
- [03:09] removing friction you know for our
- [03:10] customers uh as part of that. So so um
- [03:14] so let's get a little specific on that.
- [03:16] So let's talk maybe a little bit about
- [03:18] some use cases uh just to make it a
- [03:21] little bit more um direct. So what are
- [03:24] some of the use cases for example that
- [03:26] you started with and then I'd love it if
- [03:28] you could talk a little bit about some
- [03:29] of the things that are more emerging
- [03:30] right now. Yeah. So um let me put a
- [03:33] little bit of framing on on how how we
- [03:35] look at things a little bit more and
- [03:37] then I'll go specific into a couple of
- [03:39] use cases. Uh so when we look at um how
- [03:43] it is that we're we're we're looking at
- [03:45] applying um geni and aentic AI um you
- [03:50] know we're moving into this world where
- [03:51] we potentially have you know thousands
- [03:53] of different use cases and so we want to
- [03:56] make sure that we are um uh you know
- [03:58] removing as much friction or removing as
- [04:00] much cognitive burden for for our users
- [04:03] as possible. And so we think about it in
- [04:05] sort of four different buckets. it's the
- [04:07] customer member and how do we basically
- [04:09] create an experience around that and so
- [04:11] specifically um you know we've been
- [04:13] working on a a shopping assistant called
- [04:15] Sparky uh as part of that and uh and
- [04:18] bringing our customers along on the
- [04:19] journey for how it is they can start to
- [04:21] use uh this sort of new class of AI to
- [04:23] help them in their uh commerce
- [04:25] experiences. We look at in a second
- [04:28] bucket around our associates
- [04:30] specifically you know our associates
- [04:32] that might be working in the field uh in
- [04:34] the stores in the in the uh in the
- [04:36] distribution centers how we can remove
- [04:38] friction for them uh as well as for our
- [04:40] associates that are sort of in the home
- [04:42] office like our merchants and there
- [04:43] we've developed uh assistance for them
- [04:45] to help them with decision-m uh that
- [04:48] they need in terms of the products that
- [04:49] the that they might want to bring to
- [04:50] bear. We have assistants that are
- [04:52] helping our our field associates in
- [04:53] terms of what actions they need to take
- [04:55] in the store so that they can be more
- [04:57] efficient uh you know as more productive
- [05:00] uh you know as they're working. Uh and
- [05:02] then um we have uh sellers and suppliers
- [05:05] you know that you know that we work with
- [05:06] uh as well. And so um you know working
- [05:09] with them on how uh how to make it
- [05:12] easier for them to do to do business
- [05:13] with us. Uh, and then of course we've
- [05:15] got developers, uh, and really, you
- [05:17] know, giving them the superpowers and
- [05:19] charging them up with, you know, with
- [05:21] the new, um, agentic tools. And I'm not
- [05:23] going to use that word, so
- [05:26] word around that. Um, but, um, um, we
- [05:30] can talk about more specific examples,
- [05:32] but, um, but we have, um, you know,
- [05:35] hundreds, if not thousands of different
- [05:37] use cases, uh, you know, across the
- [05:39] company that we're, you know, that we're
- [05:40] bringing to life. And again, it comes
- [05:42] down to looking at our different
- [05:44] processes. Where is it that we've got,
- [05:47] you know, things that are manual that
- [05:48] now if we bring more data, more
- [05:51] intelligence to bear, we can start to
- [05:53] remove that friction for for our for our
- [05:56] users, for our associates, and for our
- [05:57] customers uh and going from there. Yeah.
- [06:00] And it I mean clearly so you've got
- [06:02] multiple stakeholders, you know,
- [06:04] multiple personas that you're that
- [06:06] you're building for. Um, each of them of
- [06:09] course has a set of expectations about
- [06:10] what a process with Walmart should look
- [06:12] like, right? Has looked like, should
- [06:14] look like. Yeah. How do you navigate
- [06:16] that area, that white space between sort
- [06:20] of the expected and the new in a
- [06:23] trustworthy way? Yeah, I I think it um
- [06:27] it's it's just part of how it is is that
- [06:29] we work, you know, from a customer
- [06:31] perspective. of you know trust is part
- [06:32] of our value uh value proposition and we
- [06:35] want to make sure that we're bringing uh
- [06:37] you know our our customers along for the
- [06:39] journey and the example that I often use
- [06:41] is um you know with my u I use my mom
- [06:45] she's a a longtime Walmart customer and
- [06:47] I remember growing up going to to the
- [06:49] store and doing the weekly grocery shop
- [06:51] uh you know at at Walmart um if you take
- [06:53] a step back that really is a it's a very
- [06:55] you know manual process um but she's
- [06:58] also been interacting with AI you know
- [07:00] through that whole time the fact that
- [07:01] she was able to go to the store and get
- [07:03] what it was that she wanted. It was on
- [07:04] the shelf. Um AI was used, you know, to
- [07:07] do that. Um can you can you kind of get
- [07:10] into a little bit of where the AI
- [07:12] actually or like what it is and where it
- [07:13] is in the process? Uh yeah, it's it's in
- [07:17] in so many different places. Um maybe if
- [07:19] I if I talk a little bit about you know
- [07:22] where we are to now you know the again
- [07:25] using the example of my mom. She you
- [07:26] know co comes along um she can get her
- [07:29] she can now get her you know groceries
- [07:31] delivered with online pickup and
- [07:32] delivery. Uh that whole process of being
- [07:36] able to um uh go um understand what um
- [07:41] you know what the um u you know for the
- [07:44] for us what the demand is and doing
- [07:46] demand prediction, figuring out what
- [07:48] things need to be on the shelf, figuring
- [07:49] out um you know back from the DC what um
- [07:53] you know what uh what pallet to
- [07:55] basically construct in a way that can
- [07:57] actually go to the go to the store and
- [07:59] that the people who are actually
- [08:00] unloading the trucks actually know
- [08:02] exactly what what aisle to actually put
- [08:04] things on. All of that is being driven
- [08:06] uh driven by AI and it shows up you know
- [08:08] for you know for our customers and then
- [08:10] as we move forward you know into this
- [08:12] new world um you know and you're doing
- [08:15] starting to do more things online
- [08:17] everything from the you know the site is
- [08:18] personalized you know predicting um you
- [08:21] know what what things she's going to buy
- [08:23] um being able to do replenishment and so
- [08:25] we move into this this new world where
- [08:27] where it is that we're going when I ask
- [08:29] her the question um instead of having
- [08:31] you having to go and weekly you know
- [08:32] figure out where groceries you you know
- [08:34] you you need to have delivered. What if
- [08:36] it just showed up for you uh
- [08:38] automatically because we actually
- [08:39] understand everything about you, what
- [08:41] things actually need to be replenished,
- [08:42] and it just shows up at your doorstep uh
- [08:45] potentially delivered all the way into
- [08:46] into your home. And all of that is being
- [08:48] driven by um AI, JAI, aentic AI. And
- [08:52] she's like, "Yeah, there there's no
- [08:53] question there." And that's part of what
- [08:55] I mean by bringing uh to your question
- [08:57] around bringing um bringing um you know
- [09:00] uh you know in this case the customer
- [09:01] along if you're adding value uh to what
- [09:04] it is they're uh you know to their lives
- [09:06] and in our case um you know helping them
- [09:08] you know to you know to to remove
- [09:10] friction helping them to save save money
- [09:11] and live better um which is part of our
- [09:13] mission um and we you know live up to
- [09:16] that promise then you know the the trust
- [09:18] comes and then from an associate
- [09:20] perspective if we're actually helping
- [09:22] them uh to uh um uh to do their jobs
- [09:26] better, faster, and more efficiently,
- [09:28] bringing them along on the journey as
- [09:30] well. Um you know, they're they're
- [09:32] making decisions um and then they get to
- [09:34] the point where they trust it. Um you
- [09:36] know, that's that's part of that's part
- [09:38] of how it is that we how how it is that
- [09:39] we work and we've seen that, you know,
- [09:41] both of our associates and both our um
- [09:44] our customers are coming along with us
- [09:46] on the journey.
- [09:48] Yeah. And one of the areas that I think
- [09:51] um we wanted to talk about was a little
- [09:53] bit deeper dive into inventory
- [09:55] management. So what does that look like
- [09:56] for you? Yeah. So for inventory
- [09:59] management um it's uh um you know we
- [10:03] look at that every single part of the
- [10:05] process from you know from the origin uh
- [10:08] to how it gets to the store to how it
- [10:10] gets to your home and and back and um
- [10:13] and every piece of that um is is driven
- [10:16] by AI whether it's really looking at our
- [10:18] signals and understanding the demand
- [10:20] demand prediction uh to how it is that
- [10:22] it's getting to the you know to the
- [10:23] right warehouses to how it is that we
- [10:25] then um use that to construct as I said,
- [10:28] you know, the pallets to getting to into
- [10:30] the store to figuring out where in the
- [10:31] store um you know, the the demand is um
- [10:34] and then um and and getting the getting
- [10:36] the products on the shelves. One of
- [10:39] things that we're starting to do um uh
- [10:41] uh differently uh you know in in the
- [10:44] sort of new world when it comes to
- [10:45] inventory management is starting to
- [10:47] really take a look at regional signals
- [10:49] uh and trends uh that are out there. And
- [10:52] we have something called um uh um trend
- [10:56] um a trend to product and um and that's
- [10:59] really helping us uh um especially in
- [11:02] the fashion space to really take a look
- [11:05] at uh social media signals signals that
- [11:07] we're actually getting from our
- [11:08] customers to uh to not only create new
- [11:12] products but to create them and
- [11:13] understand them and and do that really
- [11:15] really fast uh and get those um and and
- [11:18] get the products that our customers want
- [11:19] and love uh you know online into uh into
- [11:22] the store as quickly as possible. All
- [11:25] that's being driven by AI, driven by,
- [11:26] you know, Gen AI and all the new
- [11:28] techniques that are out there. And
- [11:29] that's just one case where we're
- [11:31] starting to use that in terms of
- [11:33] identifying the right products um and
- [11:35] creating the right products, you know,
- [11:36] for our customers and doing that as and
- [11:38] and and reducing the, you know, the
- [11:40] cycle for that. Uh trend to product has
- [11:42] gotten us down from, you know, from
- [11:44] months to weeks, you know, to getting
- [11:45] the right products, you know, to our
- [11:46] customers. and we're going to be able to
- [11:48] apply that to to multiple areas uh as
- [11:50] part of our um in inventory management
- [11:52] flow moving forward. But that's just one
- [11:54] example. Sure. Sure. And so on the agent
- [11:57] side like what's the state-of-the-art in
- [11:59] terms of where you're using agents and
- [12:01] then the orchestration part of the
- [12:04] agents which is of course a whole
- [12:06] different you know yeah I think um again
- [12:09] you know Walmart is a is a huge
- [12:11] enterprise we have a very large u you
- [12:14] know set of of um of services uh already
- [12:18] um and so the the way that we think
- [12:20] about it is we have a lot of the the
- [12:21] different building blocks for you know
- [12:23] for the types of different flows uh you
- [12:25] that we want to enable, you know, for
- [12:27] our um, you know, for our customers and
- [12:29] and for our associates. And so the way
- [12:31] that we look at uh at agents is how do
- [12:34] we put the right uh capabilities in
- [12:36] place around uh our services uh and
- [12:40] exposing it, you know, with the right
- [12:42] sets of experiences so that um so that
- [12:44] they can take advantage of those things.
- [12:46] And so um you know I'm sure we've
- [12:49] already talked about and we'll be
- [12:50] talking about um we break down our
- [12:52] domains and really looking at um you
- [12:56] know how do we wrap those things as MCP
- [12:58] uh uh with the MCP protocol uh and then
- [13:01] exposing those things so that we can
- [13:03] then start to orchestrate different uh
- [13:04] agents um and using you know using
- [13:07] things like A2A. So we're looking very
- [13:09] much at at at standardization um you
- [13:11] know as part of as as part of how it is
- [13:13] that we're looking to take our existing
- [13:15] infrastructure break it down and then
- [13:18] recompose it into the agents that we
- [13:19] that we want to be able to build. Say
- [13:21] the other piece that we're really
- [13:23] looking at is you know we have a lot of
- [13:24] structured data today whether it's our
- [13:26] catalog you know for example um and um
- [13:29] but we now can bring a lot of
- [13:31] unstructured data uh as well uh and how
- [13:34] is that we expose that so that we bring
- [13:36] that intelligence uh to help with you
- [13:39] know answering the questions for our
- [13:40] customers or orchestrating these
- [13:42] different flows predicting what it is
- [13:43] that they want to be able to do you know
- [13:45] uh you know moving forward. So um you
- [13:49] know for us um you know it's it's
- [13:52] creating assistance creating um and then
- [13:55] going along that journey then figuring
- [13:57] out you know once we build that trust
- [13:59] what is it that we can just sort of
- [14:00] fully automate uh and uh and and going
- [14:03] from there. So it it permeates all parts
- [14:06] of of of what it is that we do. Uh and
- [14:08] in the future what you should expect is
- [14:10] yes, we're going to automate you know
- [14:12] your your grocery delivery uh you know
- [14:14] as much as possible and with your
- [14:15] permission you know you know be able to
- [14:17] do that. Well we're on our way uh on our
- [14:19] journey for that. Great. So quick
- [14:21] followup on this. So some of the
- [14:22] unstructured signals are probably fairly
- [14:24] obvious. Are there any other
- [14:26] unstructured data sets or signals that
- [14:28] you're Yeah. So I I think um you know
- [14:31] the way that we we talk about um you
- [14:33] know the the you know how we we um what
- [14:37] we want to do is we have um you know
- [14:40] thousands of merchants who are excellent
- [14:42] uh at at what they do. They are experts
- [14:45] uh in in the categories that they
- [14:47] support. You know we have a a cheese
- [14:49] merchant who knows exactly what wine
- [14:51] goes with what cheese pairing. U but
- [14:53] that data isn't necessarily captured in
- [14:56] a structured way. Uh and now um you know
- [14:59] with the tools that we have we can
- [15:00] capture you know that that expertise you
- [15:03] know that they have uh and really bring
- [15:05] that to bear uh you know for our
- [15:06] customers when they're when they're
- [15:08] trying to figure out hey I need to you
- [15:10] know to throw the party you know what
- [15:11] kind of appetizer should I have what
- [15:13] sort of things that that's expertise
- [15:14] that that's now going to be at our
- [15:16] customers you know fingertips as an
- [15:18] example. So I'm looking forward to the
- [15:20] agentic shakurerie board frankly.
- [15:24] So, we just have a few minutes left. Um,
- [15:26] and I thought it would be a good time to
- [15:28] just ask you, you know, you've
- [15:30] obviously, you know, we're going through
- [15:32] this pretty quickly at a high level, but
- [15:33] like you've seen a lot of change. You've
- [15:36] probably had some struggles and
- [15:38] challenges that you can't talk about and
- [15:40] some struggles and challenges that maybe
- [15:42] you can talk about that you've learned
- [15:44] from. What advice do you have for folks
- [15:46] as they are sort of embarking on the
- [15:48] next, I don't know, 12 to 18 months?
- [15:50] Yeah, it's um it always comes back to
- [15:53] basics whether it's you know the change
- [15:56] with the internet you know for me the
- [15:57] most recent one was like you know with
- [15:58] mobile um really just take a step back
- [16:02] and first understand what problems do
- [16:05] you really need to solve you know for
- [16:07] your customers in our case for our
- [16:09] associates uh and um and where is their
- [16:13] friction where is there you know manual
- [16:16] work that you can now start to think
- [16:18] differently about how it is that you you
- [16:20] you automate those things. That is just
- [16:23] going to open up, you know, a world of
- [16:25] of many many different um ideas and
- [16:27] things that you didn't think or or or
- [16:29] know uh were possible. Uh and down to
- [16:32] the level of the individual. Um uh and I
- [16:35] do this for myself. I'm a developer at
- [16:37] heart and with with you know with these
- [16:39] new tools I'm not going to use the word
- [16:40] but you know I look at my job and um and
- [16:44] I'm creating my own you know agents and
- [16:46] things to you know to automate you know
- [16:48] the you know that work but it comes down
- [16:50] to the problems you know that I have and
- [16:51] where it is that I have friction. I'd
- [16:53] say the other thing from an enterprise
- [16:54] perspective um you know the other way to
- [16:57] look at this is we are moving the the
- [17:00] the change that we're seeing today is
- [17:01] very similar to what we've seen uh when
- [17:04] we went from monoliths to distributed
- [17:06] systems. Uh we don't want to repeat
- [17:08] those mistakes. So how do you take a
- [17:10] step back and take a look at the
- [17:12] foundational capabilities that you
- [17:13] already have the services and platforms
- [17:15] that you've already built and really
- [17:17] then think about okay what does it mean
- [17:19] for those services uh and platforms to
- [17:22] operate uh in an agentic world so how do
- [17:25] you decompose you know your domains what
- [17:28] MCP servers should you have what sort of
- [17:30] agent orchestration should you have what
- [17:31] is the experience we're going to be
- [17:33] looking at a very different type of
- [17:34] experience where customers are expecting
- [17:36] us to anticipate what it is that they
- [17:38] need So how are you thinking end to end
- [17:40] about um really reinventing the you know
- [17:43] the experience for our customers and
- [17:45] then using the the capabilities that you
- [17:46] have as the foundational building blocks
- [17:48] and then building on top of uh and and
- [17:50] and enabling those things to be surfaced
- [17:52] in a in in an agentic way. So yeah it
- [17:56] feels like I mean and I I don't know
- [17:58] that the extent to which you've been
- [18:00] working on this but it feels like the
- [18:02] signals that you use to evaluate
- [18:06] are going to change too. you know, in
- [18:07] other words, the methods that you use to
- [18:09] figure out what is working and what
- [18:10] isn't working. That's a whole other
- [18:12] world of sort of, you know, future
- [18:14] analytics. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it um
- [18:17] you know, in the agentic world and we're
- [18:19] starting to you know to you know to work
- [18:20] through this and it's going to change
- [18:22] but um it's going to be you know the
- [18:25] metrics around conversion and things
- [18:27] like that that those are are not going
- [18:28] to change but um uh but we're going to
- [18:31] be looking at you know goal completion
- [18:33] things like that. What does that mean?
- [18:34] How do you measure that? um did we
- [18:37] actually you know achieve you know what
- [18:38] it that you know the ultimate goal that
- [18:40] um you know that our associate that our
- [18:42] customers are actually solving. Uh and
- [18:44] so that's going to be a new way to
- [18:46] really look at how is it that we're
- [18:47] delivering you know at the end of the
- [18:49] day it's it's a measure of are we
- [18:50] delivering the benefit are we delivering
- [18:53] you know the value um you know you know
- [18:55] that we expect uh and then working back
- [18:57] from there to basically figure out the
- [18:59] right metrics and I think you know for
- [19:00] us you know you know at the end of the
- [19:02] day it's our our customers are trying to
- [19:04] solve a problem for themselves same
- [19:06] thing for our associates did we actually
- [19:08] solve that problem with these new tools
- [19:09] and so that that's what we mean by you
- [19:11] know was the goal actually met for for
- [19:13] for our customers and associates. So
- [19:15] great. Well, Desi, thank you so much.
- [19:17] Please give Desi a warm round of
- [19:19] applause.
- [19:20] Um, thanks everybody.
- [19:23] Thanks,
