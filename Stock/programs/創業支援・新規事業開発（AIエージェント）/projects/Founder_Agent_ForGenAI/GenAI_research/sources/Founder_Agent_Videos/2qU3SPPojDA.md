- [00:00] hey guys in today's video I'm going to
- [00:01] show you how you can use vzer cursor and
- [00:04] Claw to crank out Nexus applications
- [00:06] just like this one in no time at all and
- [00:09] to help you properly use these tools I'm
- [00:11] going to be sharing my three-step
- [00:12] process I use to help me go from idea to
- [00:15] app in no time so if you're an AI
- [00:17] developer looking to launch an AI
- [00:19] startup or you're an AI freelancer
- [00:21] looking to land more clients I cannot
- [00:23] stress to you enough how important it is
- [00:25] for you to learn this teex deack because
- [00:27] it helps you put Working Solutions in
- [00:29] front of your clients 10 times faster
- [00:31] and this is so important because it
- [00:33] allows you to start getting feedback
- [00:34] which helps you build better apps which
- [00:36] eventually helps you get more customers
- [00:38] so with all that out of the way and
- [00:40] hopefully you understand why it's so
- [00:41] important to land this Tech stack let's
- [00:43] go ahead and dive into what is the
- [00:44] three-step process and how the heck do I
- [00:46] start using cursor Claude and
- [00:48] VZ all right guys let's quickly cover
- [00:50] what the heck is this three-step process
- [00:52] and how does it work with our new AI
- [00:54] code stack all right so first things
- [00:56] first when it comes to our three-step
- [00:57] process our first goal based one is to
- [01:00] do a brain dump so what we're trying to
- [01:02] do is get all the ideas out of our head
- [01:04] about the application we want to build
- [01:06] and we need to do this in Two Steps step
- [01:08] one we're going to use Claude to ask us
- [01:11] a bunch of questions about what we're
- [01:12] trying to build and ultimately build up
- [01:14] a large text document of like how the
- [01:16] entire application works that's part one
- [01:19] we're going to get text part two we're
- [01:20] going to use some sort of drawing tool
- [01:22] like excal draw or you can use eraser or
- [01:25] just an actual pen and paper to go off
- [01:27] and write out and draw out like yeah I
- [01:29] want to have this page that's going to
- [01:31] have like a list of items when you click
- [01:32] on an item it's going to take you to
- [01:34] like a detail view where you can see
- [01:35] some more information about that item
- [01:37] that's a second step so we're going to
- [01:38] end end up getting a large text document
- [01:41] and a drawing of all the different pages
- [01:43] of our application this is going to set
- [01:44] the foundation for everything that we're
- [01:46] going to do which is in step two we're
- [01:49] going to go off and actually start
- [01:50] stubbing out the entire application
- [01:52] using a combination of Claude and v0 now
- [01:56] here's why Claude is great at
- [01:58] understanding like what's going on High
- [01:59] level but VZ is phenomenal at cranking
- [02:02] out nextjs code so when it comes to
- [02:05] building out your pages your service
- [02:06] side components client side components
- [02:08] v0 does a phenomenal job of
- [02:11] understanding how this framework works
- [02:13] and how to turn the text and images that
- [02:16] we pass into it into actable usable code
- [02:19] so we're going to start stubbing out the
- [02:20] entire UI using vzero then once we have
- [02:24] all the core Pages kind of stubbed out
- [02:26] looking nice then what we're going to do
- [02:28] is dive deep into phase three where
- [02:31] we're actually going to start adding in
- [02:32] functionality and in phase three we're
- [02:34] going to use a combination of v0 once
- [02:36] again and cursor now here's how I like
- [02:39] to think about phase three cuz this is
- [02:40] where things actually like you know they
- [02:41] go from looking nice to actually usable
- [02:44] so in phase three what we're going to do
- [02:46] V is going to help us dive deep into
- [02:48] like actually setting up you know our
- [02:50] functions inside of our code but even
- [02:53] though it's great at getting things like
- [02:55] 90% there we still need a little bit
- [02:57] more help so that's where cursor is
- [02:59] going to come in and it's basically
- [03:00] going to help smooth out any errors we
- [03:02] run into help us generate some like
- [03:04] synthetic data whenever we need to and
- [03:06] basically just like ultimately make it
- [03:08] to where as programmers we're not having
- [03:10] to code anymore we're just typing out
- [03:12] like hey this is broke fix it or hey add
- [03:15] this button make it look nice so at the
- [03:16] end of this that's exactly what you guys
- [03:18] are going be able to do really just talk
- [03:19] to your computer using this text deack
- [03:21] pretty much zero code and crank out a
- [03:23] beautiful application that you can start
- [03:25] showcasing to your potential customers
- [03:27] so with all that out of the way let's go
- [03:28] ahead and start hopping over to phase
- [03:30] one and actually start building out an
- [03:32] application together using this process
- [03:34] right here all right guys welcome to
- [03:36] phase one where we're going to start
- [03:37] getting the ideas out of our head over
- [03:39] into images and into text files so in
- [03:41] this part we're going to focus on
- [03:42] getting the ideas out of our head into
- [03:44] our initial drawings for what we want
- [03:46] our end application to look like so
- [03:48] here's some core lessons that you need
- [03:50] to know when building out your UI so
- [03:52] first things first we just need to keep
- [03:54] things super high level for right now so
- [03:56] think what are the pages I want to have
- [03:58] in my application and what do I want to
- [04:01] do inside of these different pages so
- [04:03] right now there's really only two pages
- [04:06] that I need so the first one just going
- [04:07] to be an offer list page to where I can
- [04:09] view a list of all of my offers I can
- [04:12] click new this will pop up a modal and
- [04:14] then once I go ahead and type in the
- [04:16] person's name and address in here it'll
- [04:19] allow me to go over to the offer detail
- [04:21] page which is the second page so as you
- [04:23] can see I'm keeping things very high
- [04:25] level I'm going to have a list of items
- [04:27] when you click this it does this so very
- [04:29] high level not much detail just here's
- [04:31] what the buttons are and then over here
- [04:33] in the detail page once again high level
- [04:35] what are the things the core things I
- [04:37] want to do well I want real estate
- [04:40] agents to be able to chat and update the
- [04:42] offer instead of manually doing it so
- [04:44] just like hey update the price hey make
- [04:46] sure the terms say this and let AI do
- [04:49] all the heavy lifting and updating the
- [04:50] document and everything like that over
- [04:52] there speaking of the offer this is
- [04:54] where in real time the agent can view
- [04:56] their offer and see the changes being
- [04:58] applied in real time with AI super cool
- [05:01] for you guys to actually see this in
- [05:02] action and then finally the biggest
- [05:04] power lift of AI is I want there to be
- [05:06] some sort of file upload section as you
- [05:09] can see very high level once again where
- [05:11] we're going to allow the agent to upload
- [05:13] files such as text files and emails so
- [05:17] that we can have our AI parse through
- [05:20] all those different conversations and go
- [05:21] oh the price of the house is this they
- [05:23] want to buy this property here's the
- [05:25] buyer here's the seller it's going to
- [05:27] parse all the information from the
- [05:28] different conversations we've had with
- [05:30] our client and other agent and actually
- [05:32] go off and fully update this offer so
- [05:34] once again AI is going to power all of
- [05:37] this and update our offer to make our
- [05:39] life easier for real estate agents so as
- [05:42] you can see this is a perfect highlevel
- [05:44] overview of what we want to build for an
- [05:46] initial MVP inside of our application
- [05:49] and I'm so excited for in the next
- [05:50] section where you actually see like
- [05:51] we're going to use a vzer to take this
- [05:54] highle drawing to an actable UI so that
- [05:57] we can actually eventually start showing
- [05:58] it to our clients to once again seal
- [06:00] more deals make more money as AI
- [06:02] developers so now that you have a high
- [06:04] level understanding of like what we need
- [06:05] to do visually when it comes to the
- [06:07] planning out stage let's hop over so you
- [06:09] can see how we're going to use Claude to
- [06:11] help us extract all the ideas out of our
- [06:13] head and into our computer so let's hop
- [06:14] over to that real fast all right so now
- [06:16] it's time for us to start focusing on
- [06:18] getting the ideas out of our head and
- [06:20] into a text format for Claude to
- [06:22] understand what the heck's going on so
- [06:23] what you can see right now on my screen
- [06:25] is I have passed in a special template
- [06:27] that's focused on making Claude a
- [06:30] professional developer who is going to
- [06:32] extract all the core ideas from our head
- [06:35] about what application we're trying to
- [06:37] build now I have this actual template
- [06:39] for free down below you guys can click
- [06:40] it and use it yourselves it's the same
- [06:42] template that I used in the last claw
- [06:45] tutorial I used so if you already have
- [06:47] it this is the same one to use but what
- [06:49] you can see what we're trying to do is
- [06:50] say all right Claude your professional
- [06:52] developer start asking me questions in a
- [06:54] conversational manner about what the
- [06:56] heck am I trying to build so that you
- [06:58] gain a full understanding of what I'm
- [07:00] trying to do the reason I like this
- [07:02] approach is because instead of me having
- [07:03] to type out everything and making sure
- [07:05] I'm being proactive about providing
- [07:07] information we're going to go no Claude
- [07:09] you be proactive and ask me the
- [07:11] questions so instead of watching me type
- [07:13] this up what I want to do is just like
- [07:14] show you an actual conversation I had
- [07:16] with Claude so that we can kind of speed
- [07:18] through this and see how we get our
- [07:20] master plan which is the text document
- [07:22] that we're ultimately after because that
- [07:23] text Document Plus our images is going
- [07:25] to help vzer work some magic and crank
- [07:28] out some beautiful nextjs code for us so
- [07:31] let's uh see what this actually looks
- [07:32] like so we're going to start the
- [07:33] conversation so you can see it goes
- [07:36] hello super excited to help you plan out
- [07:37] your app what would you basically like
- [07:39] to build and this is the perfect
- [07:41] opportunity to once again pass in those
- [07:44] highlevel images of what we just created
- [07:47] over inside the last section inside of
- [07:49] excal draw we can kind of pass those in
- [07:51] here as well to help Claude understand
- [07:53] what we're trying to build and then
- [07:54] outside of that we can just do an actual
- [07:56] brain dump as if you were trying to tell
- [07:59] a fellow co-founder what you're trying
- [08:00] to build so here's a little bit about
- [08:02] how I approach this so that you can use
- [08:04] it on your own when you're trying to
- [08:06] build your own applications so right out
- [08:08] the gate what do I like to do first
- [08:09] things first I want to go ahead and say
- [08:12] hey I'm basically just trying to make a
- [08:13] real estate application that makes it
- [08:15] easier for real estate agents to create
- [08:17] offers there are two pages inside of
- [08:20] this application there's going to be the
- [08:23] list View and the detail view just like
- [08:25] we talked about and just like we
- [08:27] uploaded then I just do a brain dump
- [08:29] inside of Claud saying here's what's
- [08:32] going to happen in each page just so it
- [08:34] fully understands exactly what should be
- [08:36] going the list view needs to have this
- [08:39] there's a button when you click the
- [08:40] button it does this basically just walk
- [08:42] through each one of the core parts of
- [08:44] this so that the AI knows what you want
- [08:46] to build and just is a quick cheat so
- [08:48] you can go off and do it on your own
- [08:50] what I usually like to do whenever I'm
- [08:52] making these brain dumps is on my Mac
- [08:54] you can set up a keyboard shortcut ask
- [08:57] chbt how to do it for your system but I
- [08:59] can hit command twice then it will allow
- [09:01] me to start talking to my computer
- [09:04] basically so I can come in here and say
- [09:05] like hey when it comes to the offer list
- [09:07] view I want to make sure that we have a
- [09:09] list of all offers I want to have a
- [09:11] button in the top right hand corner that
- [09:13] when you click it it allows me to do a
- [09:14] modal so that I can go ahead and create
- [09:16] a new offer so as you can see like yes
- [09:19] this is a little bit overwhelming
- [09:20] writing this all out but don't worry
- [09:22] we're not writing we're talking to our
- [09:23] computer so that our computer can turn
- [09:25] our ideas our voice into actual text
- [09:28] that AI specifically vzero will go off
- [09:30] and use to create beautiful applications
- [09:33] so I hope this makes sense so let's
- [09:34] quickly speed through a little bit more
- [09:36] about what's going on we just going to
- [09:37] say hey for the detail page you're going
- [09:39] to allow a chat section a file upload
- [09:41] section and an offer section here's what
- [09:43] should be happening each one of these so
- [09:45] as you're off on your own just think if
- [09:47] you were a user playing with your
- [09:48] application what do you want it to do so
- [09:50] yeah just basically make a wish list of
- [09:52] what you want to happen and then finally
- [09:53] the way I like to wrap things up just
- [09:55] coming from more experienced developer I
- [09:57] just go ahead and specifically say I'm
- [09:59] using these Technologies I'm going to be
- [10:01] using these other tools for my database
- [10:04] in our case we're going to be using
- [10:05] vercell postgress and I'm going to be
- [10:06] using drizzle as our om and I'm going to
- [10:09] be using clerk for authentication so I
- [10:12] just go ahead and dump out all the
- [10:13] different ideas of what I'm going to do
- [10:15] and also if you don't know hey doesn't
- [10:17] matter the way the AI is set up is it
- [10:19] will ask you and provide you suggestions
- [10:20] of like oh you didn't talk about
- [10:21] authentication would you like me to add
- [10:23] in some sort of authentication so super
- [10:26] excited for this to kind of give you
- [10:27] guys some guide rails to help get all
- [10:28] the ideas out of your head in a
- [10:31] eventually a master plan that we can
- [10:32] share with AI so I'm going to speed
- [10:33] through the rest of it real fast so we
- [10:34] can hop over to phase two where we're
- [10:36] actually going to start coding but as
- [10:37] you can see it's just going to ask us a
- [10:39] bunch of questions to help gain Clarity
- [10:41] around what we're trying to build so hey
- [10:43] what's the primary goal you know you're
- [10:45] suggesting to use AI well what do you
- [10:47] mean by that oh you want to use 40 so
- [10:49] that's basically what we're trying to do
- [10:51] even though we have a good understanding
- [10:52] we need the AI to have a good
- [10:54] understanding of what we're trying to
- [10:54] build so we just go back and forth back
- [10:56] and forth till eventually we end up with
- [10:59] a master plan so finally we just say hey
- [11:01] I'm done generate my master plan so that
- [11:03] I can have a nice markdown file of
- [11:06] exactly what I want to build so as you
- [11:08] can see this is a huge document kind of
- [11:10] outlining everything we've talked about
- [11:12] and what's beautiful about this is once
- [11:13] we're over in v0 we can say like hey I'm
- [11:16] working on the offer detail Page look at
- [11:18] the master plan to see what the heck
- [11:19] this is going to do so hopefully you're
- [11:21] understanding like why this all matters
- [11:22] and why it works together and sets
- [11:24] ourselves up for success as we go off to
- [11:26] Builder application so let's go ahead
- [11:28] make sure you download this file and now
- [11:29] we're going to head over to VZ so we can
- [11:31] start cranking out the initial UI of our
- [11:33] application using our master
- [11:35] plan all right guys welcome to phase two
- [11:38] where we're going to start focusing on
- [11:40] using vzer to turn our master plan plus
- [11:43] our initial images into an actual
- [11:45] stubbed out website that we can start
- [11:47] playing around in so what we're going to
- [11:49] do first in this section is upload all
- [11:52] the ideas and content that we've created
- [11:54] so far so we're right now over let me
- [11:57] show you the website we're over in
- [12:00] v.d chat and I'll have a link to it down
- [12:02] the description below so you can go
- [12:03] ahead and head over to this website on
- [12:04] your own but first things first what we
- [12:06] want to do is come in here and we are
- [12:08] going to upload all the information that
- [12:10] we have added so far so our master plan
- [12:13] and then I went ahead and took a few
- [12:15] different screenshots of the different
- [12:17] pages in our application so the front
- [12:19] end the back end what we want the you
- [12:21] know the list view to look like the
- [12:22] detail view all those I just went ahead
- [12:24] and take a screenshot from excal passed
- [12:26] it in so that we can start working with
- [12:27] it so I'm going to go ahead and add all
- [12:28] those in sorry let's actually take out a
- [12:31] few of those master plan front end I
- [12:33] think I added in a back end there we go
- [12:35] that's all we need right there great so
- [12:37] now that we're uploading everything what
- [12:38] I want to do is show you how you can go
- [12:41] and actually start going speed mode and
- [12:42] cranking out an initial UI and just to
- [12:44] put some additional context and what's
- [12:46] about to happen we are focusing on
- [12:48] stubbing out the UI so make sure
- [12:50] whenever you're talking to vzer to say
- [12:52] like Hey we're keeping things very high
- [12:54] level I just want to focus on creating
- [12:56] the pages and to make sure that they
- [12:57] look nice first because eventually we're
- [13:00] going to dive into actually building out
- [13:01] the functionality so here's how I would
- [13:03] go about working on this if I was you so
- [13:05] first things first I would say I need
- [13:07] your help creating a MVP for a real
- [13:10] estate offer application that I'm
- [13:13] working on and I would like your help to
- [13:16] initially build out the UI for the offer
- [13:19] list View and the offer detail view that
- [13:22] I have provided you once we have focused
- [13:25] on building out the UI and actually have
- [13:27] it looking nice we will will later come
- [13:29] back and start adding in functionality
- [13:32] to actually make the application work
- [13:35] period do you have any questions before
- [13:37] we begin so that should work and then
- [13:39] what we're going to do is go ahead and
- [13:40] send it off and make sure I what I
- [13:42] always like to do pro tip always ask the
- [13:44] AI do you have any questions just
- [13:46] because sometimes it might have a single
- [13:48] clarification question or two before it
- [13:51] goes off and build your application
- [13:52] which could lead to a much better result
- [13:54] so give it that opportunity to go off
- [13:56] and actually make it so as you can see
- [13:58] it's going to go ahead and actually
- [13:59] start going ahead and cranking out your
- [14:01] code and actually doing a pretty good
- [14:03] job so let me walk you through how you
- [14:05] can handle this as it's basically making
- [14:07] all the different parts of your
- [14:08] application so to start we're working on
- [14:10] the offers page which is our offers list
- [14:12] view so it's taking in you know the
- [14:14] title that new button we talked about
- [14:16] but right now it didn't have that create
- [14:19] offer modal so it eventually made it so
- [14:21] if we head back up we're going to say
- [14:22] fix with vzer and this is probably one
- [14:24] of my favorite Parts about VZ is like it
- [14:26] knows what's breaks says hey I can go
- [14:28] build it and it'll fix it for you so
- [14:31] basically let the AI work and solve its
- [14:32] own problems and it's going to
- [14:33] continually think so let me just show
- [14:35] you a few other things outside of that
- [14:37] you can see like hey we have an offers
- [14:39] page oh this is so exciting let me just
- [14:40] walk you through it real fast once it's
- [14:41] done generating so high level what VZ
- [14:44] just did for us is it made a page this
- [14:47] page is going to be inside of nextjs
- [14:50] this is going to be a serers side
- [14:51] component and this is one of the things
- [14:53] that's so beautiful about working with
- [14:54] VZ is it fully understands the nextjs
- [14:57] framework if you were to try to do this
- [14:58] with claw right now it would kind of
- [15:00] like generate a page it might try to do
- [15:03] the page routers approach and basically
- [15:05] if that doesn't make sense don't worry
- [15:07] it's just another way of working with
- [15:08] nextjs but just know Claude does not use
- [15:11] nextjs to its fullest vzer knows exactly
- [15:15] how nextjs works and can crank out
- [15:17] beautiful code that's stubbed out
- [15:18] properly and that's exactly what just
- [15:21] happened it made a offers page that has
- [15:23] an offers list view which this offer
- [15:25] list view is going to be the client side
- [15:28] component so this is exactly what you
- [15:29] would want to expect to see so this is
- [15:32] looking beautiful and then when it comes
- [15:34] over to our create offer modal for
- [15:36] whatever reason yeah the modal is not
- [15:37] going to pop up yet because this value
- [15:39] to open is not true so you're not going
- [15:40] to see it right now but like it's
- [15:42] starting to actually crank out some code
- [15:44] so let's go ahead and start working to
- [15:46] see if some of these extra pages aren't
- [15:48] made let's see if we can keep going
- [15:50] together it's looking nice for whatever
- [15:52] reason that modal isn't working but we
- [15:54] can actually go ahead and start working
- [15:56] out on slowly iterating through each one
- [15:58] of these Pages specifically the list
- [16:00] section first we're going to focus on
- [16:02] the list then we're going to hop over to
- [16:03] the detail so let's work on cleaning
- [16:05] these up super fast and sometimes VZ
- [16:07] doesn't do the best with things like
- [16:08] moduls and actually you know integrating
- [16:11] some of the different components it's
- [16:12] creating which is why it's great to have
- [16:14] VZ on one screen and your code editor in
- [16:17] the other so that you can kind of copy
- [16:18] what VZ does and add it over to your
- [16:20] application so let me show you this
- [16:21] actually in action so what I've done is
- [16:23] I went ahead and created a nextjs
- [16:25] application that is hooked up using
- [16:27] Tailwind CSS and and it's using Shad
- [16:30] scen I basically just followed all the
- [16:31] quick start guides to get to this exact
- [16:33] step that you're about to see right here
- [16:34] when I run the application you see the
- [16:36] typical nextjs startup screen that you
- [16:38] would normally see Okay cool so here's
- [16:40] what we're going to do we're going to
- [16:41] start copying the code from b0 over to
- [16:43] our editor so we can actually see it get
- [16:45] built in real time because this is it's
- [16:47] beautiful once you see it in action so
- [16:48] what we're going to do come over here
- [16:50] well you can actually do two things I'll
- [16:51] show you some magic here in a second so
- [16:52] you can go ahead and let's just copy
- [16:54] their initial page so in our case you
- [16:55] can see app offers page okay that's
- [16:58] important so we're going to do copy it
- [17:00] and then what we're going to do go over
- [17:02] make our folder so app offers and then
- [17:05] what we'll do new file and then page.
- [17:08] TSX paste it awesome looks great and I
- [17:11] did want to make sure that we spelled
- [17:13] things right offers plural fantastic
- [17:15] okay so that's one component and we can
- [17:17] actually start viewing it once we import
- [17:19] some of these missing components and
- [17:20] this is where the cheat code comes in so
- [17:22] let me show you how you can actually go
- [17:24] ahead and start working on implementing
- [17:26] some of these missing components that
- [17:27] are Shad CN components
- [17:29] that we haven't added yet but we need to
- [17:31] so here's how we can do it if you come
- [17:32] up here inside of vzer make a little
- [17:35] bigger for you guys and you see this
- [17:37] like little terminal button you can
- [17:38] click this add to codebase button what
- [17:40] it's going to do is it's going to use
- [17:41] Shad CN to add certain components over
- [17:44] to your project so let me show you this
- [17:46] cuz it's basically magic so copied that
- [17:49] back over in our code let's open up a
- [17:50] new terminal so you can see things in
- [17:52] action so what we're going to do now is
- [17:53] go okay I would like to add and then
- [17:57] what do I want to add well the
- [17:58] components that we just created so I'm
- [18:00] going to run it and what it's going to
- [18:01] do is it's going to go off and say hm
- [18:03] let me check to see what's out there let
- [18:04] me install some dependencies and then
- [18:07] what it's going to do is add in the
- [18:09] missing components so it added in the
- [18:11] app offers page for us which is exactly
- [18:13] the page you can see right here it added
- [18:15] as a component technically we don't need
- [18:17] this one because uh we actually have
- [18:19] like a full-blown you know page right
- [18:21] here so we can actually we'll delete
- [18:23] this one don't need it but the important
- [18:25] thing is we needed a button inside of
- [18:27] our code right here and it adds it for
- [18:29] us which is so cool so we have to do a
- [18:31] little bit of dancing with VZ because
- [18:33] like sometimes it'll add it as a
- [18:34] component when it needs to be a page and
- [18:36] vice versa but let me show you now that
- [18:38] we've kind of seen the initial part of
- [18:39] it working let's go ahead and import
- [18:41] these two other components so you can
- [18:43] actually see it working inside of nextjs
- [18:46] so then once you see like the initial
- [18:47] Parts working we're going to start going
- [18:49] speed mode and actually getting this
- [18:50] really cranked out so what was the other
- [18:52] part of our code that we're missing well
- [18:54] it was the offers list head over here
- [18:56] what are we going to do we're going to
- [18:58] copy our codebase button add it come
- [19:01] back over here we're going to paste it
- [19:02] in this should add our offer list View
- [19:05] and while that's running let's come over
- [19:06] here and speed mode through and grab our
- [19:09] offer modal great so that added the
- [19:12] proper component and it just spelled it
- [19:15] a little bit differently so what we'll
- [19:16] do is we'll come back and add that in in
- [19:18] a second and then what we'll do yeah
- [19:20] create offer modal let's go ahead and
- [19:22] add these part at part so what you can
- [19:24] do is you can go ahead and start trying
- [19:26] to import these in just a second and
- [19:28] then we'll go ahead and actually add in
- [19:30] our missing component so what you'll see
- [19:31] now is we are missing a few different
- [19:34] pieces of code so what we can do is
- [19:36] actually hop back over to our component
- [19:38] section and start saying hm all right I
- [19:40] want to add in our modal so you can see
- [19:43] this is called our create offer modal
- [19:45] component so just a slight different
- [19:47] name so we can just copy that over here
- [19:49] update and now what we can do is go
- [19:51] ahead and say yeah add in that piece of
- [19:53] code that we needed same for offer list
- [19:55] what we can do come back over here offer
- [19:57] list component paste it in
- [19:59] update our Imports great now what should
- [20:02] happen now that we have this all working
- [20:04] is we should be able to start seeing our
- [20:05] application run we do have a few more
- [20:07] Imports to clean up it looks like our
- [20:08] offer modal had some additional things
- [20:10] that needed to import so we'll let it
- [20:12] finish running up and then it should
- [20:14] work cool so we have just actually coded
- [20:16] out a page and a component and two other
- [20:19] components which is crazy so now let's
- [20:21] hop over to our application so we can
- [20:23] see it running so we'll go to for/
- [20:25] offers and this should show us our list
- [20:27] view on my gosh it's actually fully
- [20:30] working so now we have the ability to
- [20:31] see like hey these are the different
- [20:33] offers they're obviously not fully
- [20:35] working right now but you can actually
- [20:36] see it's all working we have a section
- [20:38] when I click new it's going to pop up an
- [20:40] offer confirmation that will actually
- [20:42] allow us to actually start putting in
- [20:44] our users you know their name and their
- [20:47] address so we now have like the initial
- [20:49] part of this working so what I'm going
- [20:50] to do because the whole part right now
- [20:52] is to get things working visually so
- [20:54] let's clean up the list view a little
- [20:56] bit more and then we're going to hop
- [20:56] over to the detail page so let me show
- [20:58] you how we can do this back over inside
- [21:01] of VZ just by strictly talking to our
- [21:04] editor and our chat and let AI do all
- [21:06] the magic for us and at this stage when
- [21:08] it comes to cleaning up there's really
- [21:10] two main things that I can think of that
- [21:11] we need to focus on fixing one we're
- [21:14] missing a nav bar which is huge so what
- [21:16] we need to do is kind of copy some hey
- [21:18] here's our current state of our
- [21:20] application over to v0 so it understands
- [21:22] where we're at and then we can say like
- [21:23] hey I was trying to add that navigation
- [21:25] bar inside of the initial drawings I
- [21:27] passed you but you're missing it so I
- [21:28] need you to go in and update the layout
- [21:30] to include a navigation bar additionally
- [21:32] when it comes to this list view I was
- [21:34] hoping that you were going to put this a
- [21:37] little bit differently specifically we
- [21:39] want to put the person's name then a
- [21:42] dash and then the actual address that
- [21:44] they're trying to work at so as you can
- [21:46] see these are just like high level
- [21:47] things that we want to be different but
- [21:49] we need our application to go off and
- [21:51] Implement so this is where we're going
- [21:52] to hop back over and start pasting in
- [21:54] necessary code that we want to update
- [21:56] along with our verbal changes so here's
- [21:58] how do it first what we want to do is we
- [22:00] said we wanted to add a navigation bar
- [22:02] so where you want to add a navigation
- [22:03] bar is usually in your layout component
- [22:06] so this is where what we're going to do
- [22:07] just like grab our layout and say like
- [22:09] hey you're going to be adding the nav
- [22:10] bar here so I'm just going to paste our
- [22:12] layout come back over here so what you
- [22:14] can do is you can add three back ticks
- [22:16] paste in your code and this will add it
- [22:18] as a code snippet into b0 and we'll say
- [22:21] hey I would like you to add in a
- [22:23] navigation bar that you can see inside
- [22:26] of the initial drawings that I passed up
- [22:29] where it's going to say AI offers in the
- [22:31] top leftand corner and then it's going
- [22:33] to have a navigation for offers and that
- [22:35] navigation link is going to be in the
- [22:37] far right hand corner and directly next
- [22:39] to that navigation link over to the
- [22:40] right we want to show the users current
- [22:43] authentication profile and that's going
- [22:45] to come from clerk great so that's all
- [22:48] we need to go ahead and set up our
- [22:50] basically set up our navigation bar and
- [22:52] the other piece of code is we wanted to
- [22:54] update our offer list view so you can
- [22:57] see right now it's kind of passing stuff
- [22:58] is like offer name and offer address and
- [23:00] we actually want to put these side by
- [23:02] side so what we can do is say hey we
- [23:04] need to update this code so what we're
- [23:06] going to do hop back over here and
- [23:07] because this code is already in v0 we
- [23:09] don't have to worry about updating it
- [23:11] additionally when it comes to working on
- [23:13] the offer list component you are not
- [23:16] properly displaying the information that
- [23:18] I was envisioning period eventually
- [23:20] going forward an offer model is going to
- [23:23] have a client name and a client address
- [23:29] period when you are generating the UI
- [23:32] cards for me to be able to click on an
- [23:35] individual offer I would like you to
- [23:37] show the client name then add a dash and
- [23:41] then show the address to the right of it
- [23:44] and make it look visually appealing and
- [23:47] the other thing that we can do guys is
- [23:49] let's just go ahead and set some basic
- [23:50] functionality just like Hey whenever you
- [23:52] click on this it should take us over to
- [23:53] the offer detail page because oh no it
- [23:55] already does it see that's how good it
- [23:57] is it already added in know that this is
- [23:59] a link so see it's already one step
- [24:00] ahead of us being proactive because in
- [24:03] our master plan which we passed up we
- [24:05] already said exactly for that
- [24:06] functionality to happen so hopefully
- [24:07] it's come in Full Circle for you to see
- [24:09] like oh yeah that is why we add a master
- [24:11] plan because it's kind of our guiding
- [24:12] North Star so the AI knows yeah this is
- [24:14] how things should connect so we didn't
- [24:16] have to say that we wanted to it just
- [24:17] did it so let's go ahead run it it'll go
- [24:19] off and actually start implementing our
- [24:21] feedback right now and it'll start
- [24:23] generating updated codes that we can
- [24:25] start adding back into our code so first
- [24:28] things first first it's going to go
- [24:29] ahead and update our layout this one's
- [24:31] simple we'll just be able to copy and
- [24:32] paste this over to our application cuz
- [24:34] layouts really aren't even viewable
- [24:35] anyway so um and you might notice
- [24:37] there's a few things when it comes to
- [24:39] clerk in here I did use clerk for
- [24:41] authentication but hey once again I
- [24:43] strictly followed the quick start guides
- [24:45] for Clerk and went ahead and just copied
- [24:47] and paste the code over into our layout
- [24:49] great layouts are done so you can just
- [24:51] click the copy button in the top right
- [24:53] come back over to our layout paste it
- [24:55] okay now it's going to it should throw
- [24:57] yeah so it went ahead and made our
- [24:59] navigation bar for us so cool then what
- [25:02] we can do come down here when it comes
- [25:04] to our offer list view you can see that
- [25:06] yeah it's actually starting to do this
- [25:08] pretty well however it's adding some
- [25:09] weird spacing so we can fix this really
- [25:11] fast but as you can see the power of V
- [25:13] Zer it's like as we're creating
- [25:15] different components and the code for it
- [25:18] what it's doing is it's going to go
- [25:19] ahead and show us a preview and this
- [25:21] preview is so powerful because we can
- [25:22] just quickly come in here and say like
- [25:24] no here's what I want to change this
- [25:26] list view is looking pretty good how
- [25:28] ever the one thing I dislike is that the
- [25:30] names are on the left and then the
- [25:32] addresses on the far right there doesn't
- [25:34] need to be this justify between
- [25:36] attribute I actually want these
- [25:38] components pretty close to each other
- [25:41] great so we're going to go ahead and run
- [25:42] that off and then what we can do is
- [25:43] start preparing to start working on the
- [25:45] next step which is the offer detail view
- [25:48] so what we'll do is we'll give VZ the
- [25:50] thumbs up of like hey I'm liking what
- [25:52] you're doing with the list view now
- [25:53] let's start moving over to finishing
- [25:55] stubbing out the detail view yeah much
- [25:57] better we're start working on stubbing
- [25:59] out the detail view so that that way we
- [26:01] can be done with phase two which is you
- [26:03] know the initial UI stub out so let's go
- [26:05] ahead this code looks great to me copy
- [26:08] you got to love a good old copy paste so
- [26:10] then we're going to come back over here
- [26:11] to our offered list view paste it things
- [26:13] look great later we could actually work
- [26:15] on adding in real data but hey future us
- [26:17] so let's see let's go ahead and go ahead
- [26:19] and refresh the component oop on didn't
- [26:22] recognize the server component ah we
- [26:25] should have update this real fast let me
- [26:27] fix this for you guys real fast
- [26:29] so update this View and just to show you
- [26:32] guys what I'm doing and it's weird cuz
- [26:33] it actually changes variables so this is
- [26:35] one of things I dislike about b z is it
- [26:37] sometimes changes the names so you can
- [26:38] see it now change it back to offer list
- [26:40] view so we'll just change it back to
- [26:41] component that way it'll work back over
- [26:43] here cool so as you guys can see there
- [26:46] are some weird Oddities of working with
- [26:49] these different you know AI tooling
- [26:51] they're not perfect but they help us
- [26:52] move really fast for cranking out MVP
- [26:54] all right this is beautiful when we come
- [26:56] back over here looks great so we're now
- [26:58] making progress when we click new we go
- [27:00] ahead and do this oh what we can do we
- [27:02] can also update the Modo super fast to
- [27:03] where it should allow us to say the
- [27:05] client name and client address so once
- [27:07] again we can hop back over and uh while
- [27:09] we're in it I just want to like show you
- [27:10] guys some like additional thoughts on
- [27:12] like how I use this tool because like I
- [27:14] said we're need to make a bunch of
- [27:16] progress in this very quickly so here's
- [27:17] how we do it so step one I'm going to
- [27:19] update that confirmation model and step
- [27:21] two I'm going to go off and update that
- [27:24] we should update our primary colors and
- [27:26] our Global CSS so that by def fault our
- [27:28] buttons are orange you know cuz like
- [27:30] right now we had to make the na bar
- [27:31] orange but that should just be our
- [27:33] primary color so what we're going to do
- [27:35] two things update confirmation modal
- [27:37] second update Global CSS so hopefully
- [27:39] you can see like we're able to quickly
- [27:40] speed through this the confir
- [27:43] confirmation model does look really
- [27:45] great however there needs to be two
- [27:47] input Fields the first input field needs
- [27:49] to be the client name and the second
- [27:54] input field needs to be the client
- [27:56] address so I should say offer needs to
- [27:59] be the offer name and the offer offer
- [28:01] client name so yeah as you guys can see
- [28:04] it's nice because you can just like
- [28:05] quickly add in and talk to it once you
- [28:07] make that change we also need to make
- [28:09] some additional changes to our Global
- [28:10] CSS period what I would like you to do
- [28:13] is make the global primary color orange
- [28:17] 500 so once I give you the global CSS
- [28:20] file please update the hsl values to
- [28:24] appropriately use this color and it's
- [28:28] also important to mention when it comes
- [28:30] to the rest of the color scheme please
- [28:32] look at my master plan where I describe
- [28:34] that the color scheme needs to be orange
- [28:36] gray white and black and please update
- [28:39] those values accordingly inside of my
- [28:41] Global CSS so I know that might have
- [28:44] seemed like a lot if you're not super
- [28:45] familiar with a global CSS but basically
- [28:47] it is your one place where you're going
- [28:49] to store all of your different variables
- [28:52] for like yeah this is my primary color
- [28:54] as you can see right now this is
- [28:55] basically black and we want that to be
- [28:57] orange so you can go ahead come back
- [28:59] over here paste in your Global CSS and
- [29:01] then let VZ do the work so as you can
- [29:03] see we have a direction we're trying to
- [29:05] go and we're just helping iterate very
- [29:08] very quickly through a bunch of
- [29:09] different like UI changes and ux changes
- [29:12] so UI we're making things more colorful
- [29:13] we're adding and missing input fields
- [29:15] and basically making everything look
- [29:17] like our initial drawings that we did in
- [29:19] excal draw so what you can see went
- [29:21] ahead and made our modal let's go ahead
- [29:24] copy paste that code over to our modal
- [29:28] looks great then what we can do let's
- [29:31] just make sure it didn't change the name
- [29:32] yeah it did change the name once again
- [29:34] we'll change it back to component looks
- [29:36] good and then we'll fix that over here
- [29:39] as well so one downfall of working with
- [29:41] v0 if we had more times we could tell it
- [29:43] not to make that change anymore but I
- [29:44] just want to move fast for you guys and
- [29:46] then finally when it comes to our Global
- [29:48] CSS you can see now it updated our
- [29:50] primary color and the rest of them
- [29:52] accordingly so let me just show you how
- [29:54] cool this is cuz this would have been a
- [29:56] pain in the butt like what the heck is
- [29:58] orange 500 in hsl like what is this
- [30:01] what's going on and I'll show you why
- [30:03] this is important a second but we'll
- [30:04] save it and then you can see
- [30:05] automatically our button is now orange
- [30:07] so and throughout the rest of the
- [30:09] application when we do our new one this
- [30:10] is orange that's orange so as you can
- [30:12] see we updated our Global variable in
- [30:14] one place and it made the rest of our
- [30:15] application look beautiful elsewhere and
- [30:17] this is a perk of using Shad CN because
- [30:20] just to give you guys a quick background
- [30:21] inside of Shad CN inside of our
- [30:23] components UI this is where we're adding
- [30:25] all the Shad CN components you can see
- [30:26] all of these are using background
- [30:28] primary and if you actually if it'll pop
- [30:30] up real fast you can see I might not do
- [30:33] it here I'll have to go back over here
- [30:35] you can see if we were to do something
- [30:36] like
- [30:38] primary background primary you can see
- [30:40] it's the hsl so that's a way to do like
- [30:44] you know there's hex rgba and hsl then
- [30:46] we want to look at the primary the
- [30:48] variable that's primary and that's
- [30:49] coming from our Global CSS So Okay cool
- [30:51] so you can see it's all coming together
- [30:52] it's all looking awesome and as you saw
- [30:54] earlier we now have client name and
- [30:56] address perfect this is everything that
- [30:58] we need in order to go off and actually
- [31:00] start working on the detail page so
- [31:02] let's go ahead next and start talking
- [31:04] back over to our vzer to start hey
- [31:07] saying hey now it's time to crank out
- [31:08] our detail
- [31:10] page so here we go all right so now I
- [31:14] would like your help working on the
- [31:16] offer detail page and as you could see
- [31:19] in the master plan and the drawings that
- [31:22] I passed up there were three major
- [31:24] components to this page the first
- [31:27] component was going going to be the chat
- [31:30] window which kind of feels like how when
- [31:33] you conversate with chat GPT where you
- [31:35] can pass messages back and forth that's
- [31:38] what we want the chat component to feel
- [31:39] like and look like below that we had our
- [31:43] file upload section where users and
- [31:45] specifically real estate agents can
- [31:47] upload conversations that they've had
- [31:49] between themselves and their clients
- [31:52] about the specific offer that they're
- [31:54] trying to put a bid in on and that
- [31:57] should allow people to upload text files
- [32:01] and HTML files and what we should do is
- [32:04] just store those inputs locally and
- [32:07] we'll work on handling them later but it
- [32:09] would be nice whenever we do upload
- [32:11] files if you could go ahead and show the
- [32:13] name of the uploaded files third over on
- [32:16] the right hand side of it missed it real
- [32:18] fast third we'll say the right hand side
- [32:22] of the screen we have a offer section
- [32:26] where the real estate agent can view the
- [32:28] offer that we're working on in real time
- [32:31] this offer is going to be updated by Ai
- [32:34] and it's important that you show this
- [32:37] offer in a markdown viewer because all
- [32:40] of the offer that we create is going to
- [32:43] be in markdown so we want it to look
- [32:45] nice and inside of this View and finally
- [32:48] it is important to mention that I would
- [32:50] like you to break each one of these big
- [32:52] items up into their own components just
- [32:54] so we can keep our code clean period do
- [32:57] you have any questions before we dive
- [32:58] into building this out also it is super
- [33:01] important that you keep everything high
- [33:03] level and focused on the visuals first
- [33:05] and later we're going to come back in
- [33:07] and add in the
- [33:08] functionality I almost didn't add that
- [33:10] last part which would have uh thrown off
- [33:11] our Phase 2 plans so as you can see now
- [33:13] it's going to go off and what it should
- [33:15] do hopefully KN on what it should
- [33:17] generate a page that page should then
- [33:19] have a few different components inside
- [33:21] of it so our check component file
- [33:22] component and our offer component so it
- [33:25] understands everything that we're trying
- [33:26] to do so yeah as you can see now it's
- [33:27] going to make that page this is a server
- [33:29] side page that's going to go off and say
- [33:31] like hey offers detail page then what do
- [33:33] we expect to happen well we're going to
- [33:36] have a chat window we're going to have a
- [33:39] over here we're going to have a file
- [33:40] upload section so as you can see we can
- [33:41] start previewing some of these pretty
- [33:43] darn cool if you ask me and then yeah
- [33:46] chat section beautiful do you know how
- [33:47] long this would have normally taken to
- [33:48] code up it just cranked it up for us
- [33:50] this is sick I love this and for our
- [33:53] offer section yeah you can see it's
- [33:55] already doing a pretty good job cuz I
- [33:56] uploaded like what a blank offer should
- [33:58] look like so it's already getting there
- [33:59] pretty well it even gave us a few things
- [34:01] to install so what I'm going to do we're
- [34:03] going to go ahead and copy these inp
- [34:04] install head back over to our
- [34:06] application go ahead and install it once
- [34:09] we do that what we can start doing is
- [34:10] actually applying some of these changes
- [34:13] however this is where you as a
- [34:15] experienced developer can provide some
- [34:17] feedback to the UI before it goes off
- [34:20] and actually we start copying this
- [34:22] specifically I see there's going to be a
- [34:24] problem between the parent page and all
- [34:28] the children component specifically in
- [34:31] the end version of our application we
- [34:33] need the ability for whenever we upload
- [34:36] a file for that to go update the offer
- [34:39] viewer so basically we need this
- [34:42] component to be able to like say hey
- [34:44] here's the updated offer show it and the
- [34:47] issue that's happening is we're missing
- [34:48] a client component so I'll just go ahead
- [34:50] and tell V hey you're missing this and
- [34:53] this is kind of where you get promoted
- [34:54] as a software developer from like a doer
- [34:56] to more of a software manager to where
- [34:58] you get to make sure yeah software that
- [34:59] you're building it's clean and it's
- [35:01] going to work as you would expect so
- [35:02] let's go ahead and say what changes we'd
- [35:04] like to see all of that looks absolutely
- [35:07] perfect exclamation mark I love the way
- [35:09] everything is looking visually however
- [35:11] we need to take a step back and add in
- [35:14] one additional component which is going
- [35:16] to be the offer detail client component
- [35:19] this offer detail client component needs
- [35:21] to receive the offer from the offer
- [35:25] detail page which is a server side
- [35:26] component and what what we want to do
- [35:28] inside of our offer detail client
- [35:30] component is share a offer between the
- [35:35] file upload component that you've
- [35:37] created and the offer viewer component
- [35:41] as well additionally we are going to be
- [35:43] sharing the offer with the chat window
- [35:46] so basically this one object is going to
- [35:47] get shared to the three children which
- [35:49] is why it needs to be a client component
- [35:51] because we're going to be using state so
- [35:54] as you can see it kind of needs you as a
- [35:56] software developer need to to know how
- [35:58] to speak the language of software
- [35:59] development this is a perfect time to
- [36:01] mention uh two different things while
- [36:03] codes generating it I just launched a
- [36:05] full stack AI developer master class
- [36:07] over inside my school community and just
- [36:09] to give you a heads up it is a in toin
- [36:12] project where you'll get to build a real
- [36:13] world full stack application that
- [36:16] focuses on AI automation people have
- [36:18] been loving the course I can't wait for
- [36:19] you to take it but if some of the things
- [36:21] that I'm saying are overwhelming
- [36:22] definitely recommend checking that out
- [36:23] cuz I really focus on going deep with
- [36:25] you guys building out a fullstack applic
- [36:28] using nextjs that where you go from step
- [36:30] by step to learning like server side
- [36:32] component client component oh this is
- [36:34] how you use for sell AI SDK like
- [36:35] everything that we're doing here I go
- [36:37] super deep so if you're looking to like
- [36:39] really freshen up as a AI software
- [36:41] developer cannot recommend that course
- [36:43] enough hundreds of people have already
- [36:44] joined they're absolutely loving it
- [36:45] would love for you to be a part of the
- [36:47] course as well but enough of that let's
- [36:48] hop back so you can actually see what's
- [36:50] going on so you can see now we have a
- [36:52] client component then we have a server
- [36:55] component then we have a yeah basically
- [36:58] did exactly what we wanted it to do so
- [37:00] what are we going to do well we're going
- [37:01] to do our best at copying and pasting
- [37:03] things over so what we can do is come
- [37:05] over here we're going to just start
- [37:07] doing the same thing with our codebase
- [37:08] and we're going to start actually
- [37:10] pasting in all of the different
- [37:12] components that it's asking us to
- [37:14] implement so we'll start off with the
- [37:16] client component which will create the
- [37:18] component offer detail client makes it
- [37:20] right there then what we're going to do
- [37:22] the page one we're going to have to
- [37:23] manually add ourselves no worries we're
- [37:26] just going to make a new let's see
- [37:28] offers ID page so you can see new offers
- [37:31] we'll make a folder ID and then inside
- [37:34] the ID we'll make a page and this is
- [37:36] just using nextjs route based pathing so
- [37:39] paste it there awesome cruising and then
- [37:41] we can go ahead and add in the final
- [37:43] three missing components so what we're
- [37:45] going to do just keep got to love this
- [37:47] the fact that we can just copy and paste
- [37:48] and literally just build code instantly
- [37:50] inside of our application so we're going
- [37:52] to add in our chat window next this
- [37:54] should probably go ahead and ask us if
- [37:56] we want to add a button no we already
- [37:58] have one do we want to add in the input
- [38:00] nope great so it went ahead and added in
- [38:03] a scroll area for us and made that new
- [38:05] component and then finally we're going
- [38:07] to keep chugging along to add in our
- [38:09] file upload section great copy that so
- [38:13] as you can see we've now like we are
- [38:14] speeding through we built an entire list
- [38:17] View and now we're cranking through a
- [38:18] detail View at Lightning Fast speeds and
- [38:21] you pretty much just have to watch this
- [38:23] to make sure that we're adding in the
- [38:24] appropriate components at different
- [38:26] times and then same for our off review
- [38:29] now for some reason this one's having a
- [38:31] little bit of a hard time reading
- [38:33] content and we'll work on adding that in
- [38:35] later basically it's just making a modal
- [38:38] basically just like making an offer
- [38:40] object and saying it should have a
- [38:41] Content but we'll come back to that
- [38:42] later because it's right now saying it
- [38:43] didn't get it but we'll go ahead and add
- [38:45] it into our project as well and that way
- [38:48] once we've added in all the components
- [38:49] we can hop back over and actually see
- [38:51] hey what the heck does this detail view
- [38:52] look like so once again no we already
- [38:55] have all the proper components great so
- [38:57] things are looking awesome so we are
- [38:59] importing all the important parts and
- [39:02] what we can do is go ahead and say what
- [39:05] do we want to happen so let's see for
- [39:07] some reason that component there it
- [39:11] looks like our page didn't get fully
- [39:12] pasted in let's copy and paste that yeah
- [39:15] it just didn't fully get pasted in all
- [39:17] right so let's work on fixing this
- [39:18] together and getting everything working
- [39:20] so first things first the offer detail
- [39:22] client is not being imported well what
- [39:25] do we need to do we need to head over to
- [39:27] to our file explorer and look for our
- [39:29] offer detail client and you can see in
- [39:31] here it's once again client component so
- [39:33] this is a big pain in the butt that it
- [39:35] takes component great so now we have our
- [39:39] page pretty much working we can update
- [39:41] our initial offer we'll make that
- [39:43] Anonymous and we're basically just
- [39:44] cleaning up bugs for right now that are
- [39:47] basically getting passed in whenever
- [39:49] we're stubbing things out so totally
- [39:51] doesn't matter we can console.log the ID
- [39:54] and like I said guys I'm just trying to
- [39:55] speed through so you can see the power
- [39:57] of going from idea to actually real
- [39:59] world application and show you some of
- [40:00] the common problems you're going to run
- [40:01] into along the way now what do we need
- [40:03] to do right now it's trying to import a
- [40:04] bunch of things that don't exist so what
- [40:07] do we do well we're going to come down
- [40:08] here and actually try importing them now
- [40:11] I'm going to cheat for you guys and show
- [40:12] you a little bit of how you can use
- [40:13] cursor to solve some of these errors so
- [40:16] one thing that you can do cuz like this
- [40:17] is kind of a pain what you can do is say
- [40:20] command a to select everything and then
- [40:23] you can do command l or control L on
- [40:24] Windows and what you can do is just have
- [40:27] check PBT solve this issue but the core
- [40:29] issue is we need to allow this to
- [40:32] understand where all of our components
- [40:34] are at so what you can do is do at and
- [40:37] then press down to go to folders and
- [40:39] then over to components perfect that's
- [40:41] all you need to do and this is using
- [40:42] cursor Pro so now we can say hey I am
- [40:45] having trouble importing the proper chat
- [40:48] file and offer viewer components can you
- [40:51] please look at the names in my
- [40:53] components folder and help me update my
- [40:55] imports as well as help me update the
- [40:59] names of the components I'm adding in
- [41:01] adding in and just to give you a quick
- [41:03] heads up whenever I'm building out
- [41:04] components like this if I'm solving a
- [41:06] problem that involves a little bit of
- [41:07] thinking I always use 40 if I'm doing
- [41:09] something that's like a quick like hey
- [41:11] just add this text I go off and actually
- [41:14] add in the ability to do basically I do
- [41:16] 40 mini so what you can see check your
- [41:18] components directory I guess it did like
- [41:21] it for whatever
- [41:22] reason it's saying it should work so hey
- [41:26] sometimes it fails sometimes it doesn't
- [41:27] but in our case what we'll do is
- [41:29] basically was the component issue we'll
- [41:31] come back to v0 later or sorry cursor
- [41:33] which when it's actually working but
- [41:34] you'll see it in a minute it is super
- [41:36] powerful when it works cool so now this
- [41:40] is a happy component life's looking good
- [41:42] everything else is looking good so what
- [41:44] we can do head over to our application
- [41:46] and what we need to do is just go over
- [41:47] to a random offers page so we'll go to
- [41:50] offers one 23 and now you can see that
- [41:53] holy crap we have a full-blown offers
- [41:56] detail page up up and running we're
- [41:58] saying like hey can I help your offer we
- [42:00] could probably let's see if we can type
- [42:01] in here we'll work on this together oh
- [42:03] my goodness we can even type in here and
- [42:04] add messages it'll looks sick eventually
- [42:07] what we're going to do in The Next Step
- [42:08] we're going to start adding
- [42:09] functionality we're going to have it to
- [42:10] where it's going to make some open AI
- [42:12] calls and actually go off and start
- [42:14] updating the offer over here in real
- [42:15] time similarly when it comes to the file
- [42:17] upload let's see if this will work let's
- [42:20] see if Shad CN and b0 work for us oh my
- [42:24] goodness it works there as well that is
- [42:26] so cool guys so now that we have the
- [42:28] basic entire application working to
- [42:31] where we can actually hop around to
- [42:33] different pages we can go ahead and hop
- [42:35] over we'll see if one of these list
- [42:37] views oh my goodness it fully works so
- [42:39] what we're going to do next is we're
- [42:40] going to hop over to the detail portion
- [42:42] of this in phase three where we're
- [42:44] actually going to start adding in
- [42:45] functionality and this is where you're
- [42:46] going to see a lot more of vzer working
- [42:49] with cursor to rough out some of the
- [42:51] errors that we're going to see when it
- [42:52] comes to implementation so let's go
- [42:54] ahead hop over to phase three so we can
- [42:55] start cranking out the rest of this this
- [42:58] application all right guys welcome to
- [43:00] phase three where we're going to start
- [43:01] adding in functionality to all of the
- [43:03] different components that we just
- [43:05] stubbed out in the last phase so you're
- [43:06] going to see us using v0 and cursor to
- [43:09] their full potential I'm so excited for
- [43:10] you to see this and just as a quick
- [43:12] overview of where we're going together
- [43:14] first we're going to go off and add in
- [43:16] functionality to our offer list view so
- [43:18] right now if we head over to our offer
- [43:20] list view let's go back for a second all
- [43:22] the data in here is static meaning you
- [43:24] know nothing about this is changing and
- [43:26] when we click new it's not actually
- [43:27] adding a new offer so we're going to
- [43:29] make this actually Dynamic and hooked up
- [43:31] to a database so we can save stuff and
- [43:33] all of it works then in the next section
- [43:36] we're going to go off and actually is go
- [43:38] off and set up this chat to actually
- [43:41] update the offer in real time so this is
- [43:42] where we're going to actually start
- [43:43] integrating some AI so you can actually
- [43:45] see like this all working together and
- [43:47] actually adding out modern AI
- [43:49] functionality to applications using vzer
- [43:52] and cursor so excited for you guys to
- [43:53] get to see this and as a quick
- [43:55] background I did just want to mention
- [43:56] for to make things super quick in this
- [43:58] video I went ahead and added in the fact
- [44:01] that we're using versell postgress so I
- [44:03] basically I I hooked up a database to
- [44:04] our application and I did this by going
- [44:07] and hooking up and creating a postgress
- [44:09] database inverell and then I ended up
- [44:12] standing up and setting up drizzle to
- [44:14] work inside of our local application so
- [44:16] basically this file right here saying
- [44:17] yep I'm using drizzle here's how we
- [44:20] connect to our database and I went ahead
- [44:22] and created an offers schema just so we
- [44:24] can move fast so in this you can just
- [44:26] see we have everything that we need to
- [44:28] know about an offer that we're creating
- [44:29] for application such as who made it what
- [44:31] user what's the name of the client and
- [44:33] where is the address of the house we're
- [44:34] trying to buy cool so now that we're on
- [44:36] the same page we can actually hop over
- [44:38] back to vzero and start implementing
- [44:39] some of the offer list features that we
- [44:41] just talked about and as a quick
- [44:42] overview I did want to mention if any of
- [44:44] this is confusing don't worry there's a
- [44:46] bunch of different options a if you head
- [44:47] over to my free AI developer School
- [44:49] Community feel free to go over there ask
- [44:51] some questions if you want a little bit
- [44:52] more help I am going to convert this
- [44:54] entire course into a much longer Mini
- [44:57] module over inside of my AI developer
- [44:59] accelerator Pro program so in there I'll
- [45:02] actually show you guys setting up the
- [45:03] database setting up clerk setting things
- [45:05] up in to end and adding out some
- [45:07] additional features such as like working
- [45:09] with the file upload section so you can
- [45:10] kind of see even more functionality if
- [45:13] you want that and then finally if you're
- [45:14] like man a lot of this full stack
- [45:15] development is way over my head don't
- [45:17] worry I just launched like I said a full
- [45:19] stack AI marketing platform course where
- [45:21] I teach you from in to end how to build
- [45:23] a modern AI fullstack application but
- [45:25] with all that out of the way let's go
- [45:26] ahead and hop back over to v0 so we can
- [45:28] start cranking out some of the new
- [45:29] features that we just talked about so
- [45:31] first things first when it comes to the
- [45:32] offer list view what we're going to do
- [45:34] is go ahead and grab that schema that I
- [45:37] went ahead and created for you guys come
- [45:39] back over here and what we're going to
- [45:40] do paste in our schema just so that VZ
- [45:43] knows the type of models that we're
- [45:45] working with so as we go off and say
- [45:46] like hey I want you to use the offers
- [45:48] model it will know exactly what it's
- [45:50] working with so what we're going to do
- [45:52] now is go ahead and describe what
- [45:54] Behavior we want inside of our
- [45:56] application and just as a quick
- [45:58] refresher sometimes vzer isn't the best
- [46:01] at keeping track of what your previous
- [46:03] models were or your previous Pages were
- [46:05] so what I also like to do is come in
- [46:07] here and in our case it was having
- [46:09] trouble with the offers page so I'm
- [46:11] going to add that in as well just put it
- [46:13] in three quotes that way it knows what
- [46:15] it is and also the offer list view
- [46:18] component it seemed to have trouble with
- [46:20] that one earlier so I'm going to also
- [46:21] drop this in three quotes great so now
- [46:24] that we've given VZ an updated version
- [46:26] of our application what we can do is go
- [46:28] ahead and describe exactly what we're
- [46:29] looking for so uh here's what we can say
- [46:31] I need your help in building out the
- [46:34] offer list view portion of the
- [46:37] application so here's what I would like
- [46:38] you to do first I would like you to
- [46:41] start using and creating a new queries.
- [46:45] TS file that goes off and pulls records
- [46:50] from the offers table for our specific
- [46:53] user so basically whenever we want to go
- [46:56] ahead and fetch all the offers for our
- [46:58] current user in the list view you should
- [47:00] use this queries file where you're going
- [47:02] to add in all of your queries to get
- [47:04] offers for the current user outside of
- [47:07] that what I want you to do is update the
- [47:09] offers page on load to go off on the
- [47:13] server side component and fetch the
- [47:16] current offers for the current user and
- [47:19] pass those fetched offers down to the
- [47:23] client side offers component period do
- [47:26] you have any questions before you go off
- [47:28] and update these pages and components
- [47:31] and create the new query so I know that
- [47:34] was a mouthful but what I wanted to do
- [47:35] just so you can see how I'm thinking
- [47:37] about this and hopefully this behind the
- [47:38] scenes helps so when you're out building
- [47:40] your own pages and components and own
- [47:42] applications you know exactly what to
- [47:43] say basically what I'm trying to do is
- [47:45] think programmatically of like what are
- [47:46] the key actions that I want to occur so
- [47:48] that's why I stated them at the end and
- [47:50] then what I like to do is as you begin
- [47:53] to use nextjs more and more you'll kind
- [47:54] of recognize like oh yeah this is a
- [47:56] serers side comp component this is a
- [47:57] client side component here's the
- [47:59] functionality and the flow that I would
- [48:01] normally code out myself but I can just
- [48:02] have v0 do it for me so as you can see
- [48:04] it went off and created a new queries
- [48:07] for us which is sick this is exactly
- [48:09] what we want where you can see we're now
- [48:10] going to grab from our database our
- [48:13] offers that are all for the current user
- [48:15] this is exactly what we wanted and it
- [48:17] went off and it looks like updated our
- [48:19] two other tables or our page in our
- [48:21] table two so you can see now it's
- [48:22] getting it and then it's passing it in O
- [48:24] looks awesome and then over here when it
- [48:27] comes to our offer list view component
- [48:28] you can actually see that yeah we're
- [48:30] getting State and adding it oh this is
- [48:32] exactly what we want so what we can do
- [48:34] we can grab each one of these and
- [48:36] actually add them over to our code so we
- [48:38] can start trying it out so what we're
- [48:40] going to do go over to our server and
- [48:43] here we're going to make a queries. TS
- [48:45] file and this is going to be where we
- [48:47] can actually add in support for our
- [48:49] queries so what I like to do whenever
- [48:52] there's import issues that's usually
- [48:53] just cuz VZ doesn't know what our local
- [48:56] application using like import pathwise
- [48:58] so you can just usually come in here and
- [49:00] press command period on a Mac or alt
- [49:02] period on Windows and import all the
- [49:04] missing dependencies so import from our
- [49:07] DB file grab it from our offers table
- [49:10] perfect this is exactly what we want now
- [49:12] we can head back over to our offers page
- [49:14] so we're in the offers page now go ahead
- [49:16] grab that component paste it over here
- [49:20] looking awesome now what you're going to
- [49:22] notice is we broke something and that's
- [49:23] because initial offers is a new thing
- [49:25] that we just added and and if we come
- [49:27] over here you'll notice in our offers
- [49:29] list view component we are now passing
- [49:31] it in as a prop and that's exactly what
- [49:32] we would expect to happen so if I come
- [49:34] over here paste it great and now we're
- [49:36] no longer using mock data we're going to
- [49:39] go ahead and create the real deal so
- [49:41] this is looking great guys so let's make
- [49:43] sure everything's working things looking
- [49:45] good and when it comes to our queries we
- [49:47] need to update to make sure we get them
- [49:49] from our server folder that we set up
- [49:51] just a second ago awesome so now if we
- [49:54] refresh the page what we should start
- [49:56] seeing in a second is all this working
- [49:58] so right now it's saying the offers
- [49:59] table isn't working this is a quick
- [50:01] schema issue so what we can do whenever
- [50:03] you're using drizzle to make a DB change
- [50:06] I just never pushed my changes you can
- [50:08] run npx drizzle kit push it'll push your
- [50:11] local changes to the database so you can
- [50:13] see it's going to go off and actually
- [50:15] make everything look nice and then let's
- [50:17] see create a column this was uh my my
- [50:20] bad I think we have to run it one more
- [50:22] time sometimes there's always a quick
- [50:23] little issue yeah now things are working
- [50:25] so now when we go back over to our
- [50:26] application and refresh what we'll start
- [50:29] to see is like yes we actually have
- [50:30] offers now so it's pulling it just so
- [50:32] happens that we don't have any offers
- [50:34] from our database yet so we could
- [50:37] manually create one but we're not going
- [50:38] to do that we're going to actually get
- [50:39] everything set up to support this new
- [50:41] button functionality so that's what
- [50:43] we're going to work on next whenever I
- [50:44] click this and actually come in here and
- [50:46] create a new offer it should add it to
- [50:48] our database so let's hop back over to
- [50:50] v0 and start stubbing this out so what
- [50:51] we're first going to do is hop back over
- [50:53] and just quickly look at what our create
- [50:56] offer modal looks like so we can see
- [50:58] what's missing and right now it just
- [51:00] looks like handle create isn't actually
- [51:03] doing anything so that's the main thing
- [51:06] like handle create should probably go
- [51:07] off and actually create a new endpoint
- [51:10] and then inside of our list view what
- [51:11] you'll notice is we're not really doing
- [51:13] anything with the basically with it so
- [51:15] we're just offer sorry the yeah the
- [51:18] create offer modal component should go
- [51:20] off and actually do something so what we
- [51:22] need to do is tell we're going to just
- [51:24] copy it over here we're going to hop
- [51:26] back over to v0 and start telling VZ how
- [51:28] it should properly handle working with
- [51:31] this client to go off and actually
- [51:32] create a new basically a new offer and
- [51:35] this is where we're going to start
- [51:36] setting up some endpoints so I'm excited
- [51:37] for you guys to see this can you please
- [51:39] help me add in functionality so that
- [51:42] whenever I create a new offer it
- [51:45] actually goes off and makes a request to
- [51:48] a backend endpoint to handle the
- [51:51] creation of a new offer so breaking this
- [51:53] down you need to use the axios package
- [51:57] to create and send off a post request to
- [52:01] a backend endpoint such as API offers
- [52:06] and I think that should be a great
- [52:07] endpoint to use right now then what I
- [52:09] would like you to do inside of that
- [52:10] backend endpoint is create a nextjs app
- [52:15] router post endpoint that should accept
- [52:19] and handle us passing over the client
- [52:22] name and the address of the offer that
- [52:25] we're going to go off and put a bid on
- [52:29] and once we go off and actually send
- [52:31] that request the post endpoint should
- [52:33] handle the creation of this new offer in
- [52:37] our drizzle postgress database and then
- [52:41] return the newly created offer back to
- [52:44] the front end period do you have any
- [52:46] questions before you go off and set up
- [52:48] this new API route and handle all the
- [52:52] functionality in the create offer
- [52:55] locally so this is a great first stb so
- [52:57] as a software developer I'm trying to
- [52:59] think like core functionality first and
- [53:01] then few things that I'm also thinking
- [53:02] about is like hm is VZ going to add in
- [53:04] some nice UI so back over here whenever
- [53:07] I click create is it going to do a
- [53:08] loader for us so these are just things
- [53:09] that I think about as bz's going off
- [53:12] working for us is like I try and like
- [53:13] think of like next steps and I usually
- [53:15] like to add them while it's working so
- [53:16] this way like I'm working faster so I
- [53:18] can see like loading while
- [53:21] creating what else can I do like I said
- [53:23] I just try and think proactively while
- [53:25] it's working so I'm stand sharp and B I
- [53:28] can just note down all the things that
- [53:30] we need to add in eventually and let VZ
- [53:32] do the heavy lifting for us and in a
- [53:34] little bit I promise we're going to get
- [53:35] over to cursor implementing some of the
- [53:36] more fine level details it's just right
- [53:38] now this highle code v0 just does so
- [53:40] well that it's actually hard to need
- [53:42] anything else okay so what we can see in
- [53:44] the create offer modal it definitely
- [53:46] added oh my gosh it did it for us it
- [53:48] added in is loading beautiful so you can
- [53:51] see now what it's going to go off and do
- [53:53] is make a post request to our offers
- [53:55] endpoint passing up all the information
- [53:57] we need looks great yeah this is exactly
- [54:00] what we want it is refreshing the page
- [54:03] we'll work on that and we can use cursor
- [54:04] for that but what we can do now is copy
- [54:06] this head back over to our create offer
- [54:08] modal paste in here get rid of all that
- [54:11] now what you're going to notice is it
- [54:12] doesn't have axios so what we can do is
- [54:15] come down into our terminal npmi axios
- [54:19] we're going to install the missing
- [54:20] package which will set us up for success
- [54:22] to go off and send request to our back
- [54:23] end and while we're here what we can do
- [54:26] is say we'll start using cursor so what
- [54:28] you can do highlight the text that you
- [54:30] want to and then you can hit command L
- [54:33] and then what it'll do windows check you
- [54:35] might have a different key but what we
- [54:36] can say is like hey I actually don't
- [54:38] want to refresh I want to navigate over
- [54:41] to the other page so here's what we can
- [54:42] do can you please update this code to
- [54:45] pull out the offer that gets sent back
- [54:48] in the response and then we want to use
- [54:51] react nav navigation to redirect us over
- [54:55] to the offers page and that offers page
- [55:00] is going to include the ID of the new
- [55:02] offer so we'll just go ahead and stub it
- [55:05] out for us so we'll do offers and then
- [55:07] we'll just do offer
- [55:08] ID perfect so this will go off and
- [55:10] actually get the right code working for
- [55:12] us so you can see now it's doing router
- [55:13] push we can apply that and for whatever
- [55:16] reason it didn't add in next navigation
- [55:18] but we'll work on that in a second so
- [55:20] you can see all of that looks great
- [55:22] looks great and then router use router
- [55:25] this is just yeah perfect this is
- [55:26] exactly what we wanted Okay cool so now
- [55:28] whenever we create a new offer it should
- [55:30] a make an entry in the database once we
- [55:33] update our API and then it'll redirect
- [55:35] us over to the detail page this is
- [55:37] coming along great guys we're cruising
- [55:39] all right so what was the final thing
- [55:41] that we wanted to do we wanted to set up
- [55:42] our API offers route so what can we do
- [55:45] well what we can do open up our file
- [55:46] explorer and then in our app folder what
- [55:49] we can do is create a new folder called
- [55:52] API and then they said API offers route
- [55:55] so as exactly what we're going to do
- [55:58] API offers and then we're going to make
- [56:00] a route. TS route. TS great and then
- [56:05] we'll just paste in our sorry wrong code
- [56:07] paste in our offers route code looks
- [56:10] great paste it in here and we should be
- [56:12] getting some sort of a post request and
- [56:14] per usual we got to clean up some of the
- [56:16] Imports just cuz it doesn't know exactly
- [56:19] what our local file structure looks like
- [56:21] and our offers tables sick and this
- [56:23] looks great guys and let me just quickly
- [56:25] walk you through what's happening we're
- [56:26] going to use clerk to get our current
- [56:28] user ID if they're not logged in throw
- [56:30] an error outside of that we're going to
- [56:31] get and check basically check to see
- [56:34] that the User submitted the client name
- [56:35] and address make sure that we got that
- [56:37] information if we didn't do some
- [56:38] validation then we're going to use
- [56:41] drizzle to go off and insert a new offer
- [56:45] into our offers table the content field
- [56:48] is where we're eventually going to store
- [56:49] the offer but for right now we'll just
- [56:50] set it to en and returning is going to
- [56:52] give us back the newly created offer so
- [56:54] this is how we're going to return the
- [56:55] offer back to our front end so now let's
- [56:57] take this for a spin to see if it works
- [56:59] so let's refresh the page looks great so
- [57:01] let's go ahead and click new and let's
- [57:03] just do
- [57:04] Brandon and let's just do 3 2 one
- [57:07] Atlanta Georgia and let's see should
- [57:10] create it go off and then it should
- [57:12] redirect us over to the offers detail
- [57:15] page which it exactly did looks sick
- [57:17] guys so now if I go back and actually
- [57:19] just update the URL real fast to go back
- [57:21] to regular offers I should now see the
- [57:24] newly created offer because when you
- [57:26] know this is now a part of our database
- [57:28] so you can see that our endpoint did
- [57:29] successfully add it to our backend
- [57:32] database and the API sent back a
- [57:34] response of the new offer so that we
- [57:36] could redirect over to the offers detail
- [57:38] page this is awesome so now that we got
- [57:40] our basically got this initial part
- [57:42] working what we can do is head over and
- [57:44] start working on the offers detail page
- [57:47] and this is where we're going to get our
- [57:48] hands a little bit dirtier and getting
- [57:49] this chat functionality to work to where
- [57:51] this chat will update this offer it's
- [57:54] going to be a little bit more in the
- [57:54] weeds but I'm super excited for you guys
- [57:55] to see it in action so let's go ahead
- [57:57] and we're going to hop back over to b0
- [57:59] and start cranking this out and actually
- [58:00] real fast before we hop over to b0 I
- [58:02] think this is a perfect opportunity to
- [58:03] show how you can start using cursor to
- [58:06] implement some of these features so what
- [58:08] we're going to do this time is we're
- [58:09] going to hop over to the versel AI STK
- [58:12] docs I'll have a link to this down the
- [58:14] description below but you can see right
- [58:16] now we're in the chat box section so
- [58:18] what we're going to start working on is
- [58:20] implementing their examples for setting
- [58:23] up a page a client side component to go
- [58:26] go off and start chatting with versel AI
- [58:29] SDK tools so this is how we can start
- [58:31] actually chatting over here and actually
- [58:32] start sending a request over to an open
- [58:34] AI llm to actually send us back a
- [58:36] response an AI response so what are we
- [58:38] going to do well the cool way to do this
- [58:41] is on a Mac you can just go ahead and
- [58:43] copy this URL so I copied the URL now
- [58:46] what we're going to do we're going to
- [58:47] hop back over to our code and this is
- [58:49] where we can start leaning on cursor to
- [58:51] start doing some extra implementation
- [58:53] for us so you can see right now I'm in
- [58:55] the chat at window TSX file what we're
- [58:58] going to do is I'm going to open up a
- [59:00] sidebar and the first thing I'm going to
- [59:02] do is I'm going to add a reference to
- [59:06] those docs so I can hit at and then what
- [59:09] I can do is go down to docs now once I'm
- [59:12] in docs I can add new docs so in this
- [59:14] case I'm going to paste the URL of the
- [59:17] documents we were just looking at
- [59:18] awesome and then I can just call this AI
- [59:22] SDK chatbot great so now it's going to
- [59:25] go off it's going to parse all the
- [59:26] information from those docs and now what
- [59:28] I can do whenever we come back over to
- [59:31] our code is I can say basically hey
- [59:33] please help me update this and add in
- [59:36] the support for a new chat API endpoint
- [59:39] so here's how I can do it and for bigger
- [59:41] request like this I always use 40 cuz
- [59:44] there we need to do some thinking can
- [59:45] you please help me update my chat window
- [59:48] to allow me to start using the versel AI
- [59:51] SDK functionality of chatting with
- [59:55] basically basically the AI and in
- [59:57] addition to that can you help me also
- [59:59] set up an API chat endpoint that will
- [60:04] work with this new chat functionality
- [60:06] that we're working on setting up
- [60:07] together great and let me just go ahead
- [60:09] and fix this versell AI
- [60:13] SDK Oh wrong one verel versel AI SDK
- [60:19] great so this is going to go off read
- [60:20] those docs and then what it's going to
- [60:21] do I'll zoom out just a little bit so we
- [60:23] can kind of see it so first it's going
- [60:24] to say he you'll need to update this to
- [60:26] start using chat so that was the hook
- [60:28] that's being recommended and then it's
- [60:29] going to go ahead and show us exactly
- [60:31] the changes we need to implement in our
- [60:33] system so Step One update our code step
- [60:36] two go create that endpoint so we're
- [60:37] going to just click apply to make this
- [60:39] magic happen so we're going to go ahead
- [60:40] and start importing these so we're going
- [60:42] to say yes then what we're going to do
- [60:45] is now it's going to cause a few
- [60:46] different issues but what we can do is
- [60:49] start actually importing these so we can
- [60:51] ask a follow-up question how can I
- [60:53] install AI react
- [60:58] and the other
- [60:59] dependencies needed for the chat bot
- [61:03] this one might not work but hey we'll
- [61:05] try it together cuz like sometimes the
- [61:06] docs don't have all of it so but right
- [61:08] now it looks like it does and we're
- [61:09] using npm so let's see if this works npm
- [61:12] install that should hopefully go off and
- [61:15] work things are looking great so this
- [61:17] should hopefully get rid of that in just
- [61:19] a second if not we might need to install
- [61:21] yep no perfect so it worked now what
- [61:23] you're going to notice is it had a few
- [61:26] different small issues with sending off
- [61:30] our request so like I said it's not
- [61:32] perfect and it's also not handling our
- [61:35] current offer and updated offer so what
- [61:38] we can do and this is where you can
- [61:39] start using some of the magic of AI what
- [61:41] we're going to do is we're going to get
- [61:42] this working then we're going to go set
- [61:43] up our backend API endpoint so here's
- [61:46] what I want to do as you can see in this
- [61:48] file we're not using offer or update
- [61:51] offer and what I would like you to do is
- [61:54] start using these different props as
- [61:58] local state variables like we were doing
- [62:00] at the beginning of this code change so
- [62:03] here's what I would like to happen as
- [62:06] you go off and make changes to the code
- [62:12] what I want to do is sorry whenever you
- [62:14] go off to send a chat message I also
- [62:16] want you to pass along the current offer
- [62:20] as well in addition to that I'm noticing
- [62:23] that Onkey press is deprecating
- [62:26] inside of the input tag inside of the
- [62:30] code you just created now some of this
- [62:33] is going to be a little out of place
- [62:35] just because right now we only are going
- [62:37] to set up chatting but in the next part
- [62:39] we're going to set up chatting with some
- [62:40] tool calling so that's why we need to
- [62:42] start handling and working with offer
- [62:45] and update offer so you can see it's
- [62:47] going to go ahead and start going down
- [62:49] the right path yeah this is exactly what
- [62:51] we want so we're going to implement it
- [62:52] and once we start actually going off
- [62:54] yeah accept so accept all
- [62:56] looking great so yeah in just a second
- [62:58] we're going to go off and actually start
- [63:00] implementing some tool functionality to
- [63:02] handle offer change so this is perfect
- [63:04] for right now then what we can do is go
- [63:06] off and actually add in that API code I
- [63:10] can't remember what it is so we can just
- [63:11] say hey can you please show me that API
- [63:14] chat code again so that's just me being
- [63:16] hyper lazy but while it's going up and
- [63:19] loading we can go ahead and create a new
- [63:21] file to support this so it was chat
- [63:24] route. TS great then what we can do is
- [63:27] add in their code right here so let's go
- [63:30] ahead and apply it into our new route
- [63:32] continue and it'll go off and actually
- [63:34] add it looking great and then what we
- [63:36] can do is say like Hey how do I import
- [63:38] this so once again how do I install the
- [63:41] AI SDK open AI then it'll go ahead and
- [63:44] give us the proper command that we need
- [63:46] to install on our local machine to get
- [63:48] all this working so it's asking us to do
- [63:51] open Ai and AI I don't know if those are
- [63:53] right and this is where sometimes like
- [63:54] cursor falls apart art when it's kind of
- [63:57] new knowledge cursor is great at solving
- [64:00] existing problems but when it comes to
- [64:02] like like I said new problems that are
- [64:04] like specific to what we're what we're
- [64:06] trying to do sometimes it kind of falls
- [64:08] apart so in our case let me go ahead and
- [64:10] find the package free guys real fast
- [64:11] yeah it actually was just a super quick
- [64:12] fix all we have to do is come down here
- [64:14] and paste in open AI SDK and sorry let
- [64:18] me move this out of the way so you can
- [64:19] see it so we can do
- [64:21] npmi then paste in the name and that
- [64:23] should go ahead and get that working
- [64:25] okay so once it properly shows that
- [64:27] we've installed the proper package which
- [64:30] it's done now what we can do let's hop
- [64:32] back over to our code let's comment this
- [64:34] out for now and what we're going to do
- [64:35] is going to start trying to make sure
- [64:36] that it is working and what we can do I
- [64:40] don't think that'll cause any errors
- [64:41] we'll leave it how it is right now so
- [64:43] what we can do now is we'll start
- [64:45] actually asking questions in our chat to
- [64:47] make sure that it's properly handling
- [64:49] and showing all the different messages
- [64:52] so you can see right here messages just
- [64:54] to give you a little bit background all
- [64:56] of this like these messages the input
- [64:58] the handle input change all of that's
- [64:59] coming from used chat so that's the hook
- [65:02] that we've basically by using the
- [65:04] versell AI SDK that's how we're going to
- [65:06] be able to access all these nice
- [65:08] functions that make our life super easy
- [65:10] for interfacing with the AI so what we
- [65:12] can do now is if we hop back over to our
- [65:14] code we can start asking questions so
- [65:16] let's go back over here to our chat
- [65:18] refresh the page and one thing is super
- [65:20] important to mention you will need to
- [65:22] add your open AI API key into your EMV
- [65:25] file so over here you know you'll need
- [65:28] to add in your open AI key to thatv file
- [65:31] so that it can actually like have a
- [65:33] proper key to go off and do it so now we
- [65:34] can actually start asking questions so
- [65:36] we can start say like let's smoke test
- [65:38] this together hello who was the first
- [65:40] president of America and if it's working
- [65:43] it should actually come back to us with
- [65:45] an llm answer so this is like obviously
- [65:47] we now have our front end hooked up to
- [65:49] our backend so that we can start making
- [65:50] AI requests now this is obviously we
- [65:53] want this to start working for Real
- [65:55] Estate offer so what we're going to dive
- [65:56] into next is start working with versel
- [66:00] AI SDK tool calling so now we're going
- [66:03] to start working on adding a tool call
- [66:05] to update our offer on the right hand of
- [66:07] the screen so talk about it on the left
- [66:10] and then see the changes happen on the
- [66:11] right so I'm super excited for you guys
- [66:12] to see it so let's hop back over here
- [66:14] and we're going to start hopping over to
- [66:16] some Doc so I can show you exactly what
- [66:17] we need to change and we're going to get
- [66:19] everything set up so let's head back
- [66:20] over to the docs and as you can see when
- [66:22] we hop over to chatbot with tools there
- [66:25] is a specific way that we can go off
- [66:28] inside of our backend chat route
- [66:31] function that we just set up that will
- [66:33] execute code on the server so this is
- [66:36] exactly what we want to do in our case
- [66:38] what we're going to do is not have a get
- [66:41] weather information in our case we're
- [66:43] going to have an update offer tool and
- [66:46] that Tool's sole job is to take in an
- [66:49] offer take in some feedback from the
- [66:52] agent and go off and actually create a
- [66:56] new updated offer so that's all we're
- [66:58] trying to do so this is where we're
- [66:59] going to start actually like getting in
- [67:00] the weeds of you know going back and
- [67:02] forth with open Ai and actually getting
- [67:05] things working now I will say for this
- [67:07] I'm going to hop over back to vzer just
- [67:10] so you can kind of see VZ back at work
- [67:13] cuz awesome tool so that means we're
- [67:14] going to need to pass in our updated
- [67:15] code but I think you guys will really
- [67:17] like it like I said I just want to
- [67:18] showcase how these different tools can
- [67:20] work so what we'll do we'll go ahead and
- [67:22] actually paste pretty much you can just
- [67:24] paste this entire code right here uh
- [67:27] let's grab that awesome so now we can
- [67:29] head back over to v0 and our case right
- [67:32] here real estate offer great so now
- [67:34] we're going to say let's just make sure
- [67:36] on the same page here is a new document
- [67:41] I want us to follow so go ahead and just
- [67:44] paste it in it might actually if it's
- [67:46] too long go ahead and paste it as a
- [67:47] snippet that's fine and then we're can
- [67:49] say here is my updated code by the way
- [67:53] and in here what we can do is paste in
- [67:55] our new backend route and we can paste
- [67:57] in our new basically past in our new
- [68:00] updated chat window so paste in our chat
- [68:03] window great and then we can paste in
- [68:05] our route and the reason why we're doing
- [68:06] this is because now we're going to start
- [68:08] actually implementing the server side
- [68:09] changes and we're going to be updating
- [68:11] what's happening on the client and
- [68:12] what's ha happening on our backend route
- [68:14] at the same time so let's go ahead and
- [68:17] start telling the code what we want to
- [68:20] do so here's how we can do it I need
- [68:22] your help updating this backend chat
- [68:25] route to start supporting tool calling
- [68:29] so I would like to add in a new tool
- [68:32] call that is called update offer and
- [68:36] what this tool is going to accept as
- [68:38] parameters are the current offer and in
- [68:42] addition to that it's going to take in
- [68:44] feedback this feedback is going to
- [68:47] describe changes that we need to make to
- [68:49] the offer in order for it to adhere to
- [68:53] what the real estate agent wants once
- [68:55] once we accept those parameters what I
- [68:57] want you to do is call AI so in our case
- [69:02] versel AI to once again use open AI chat
- [69:06] GPT 4 in order to combine that feedback
- [69:12] and the current offer and generate a new
- [69:16] offer it is super important that you
- [69:19] generate this offer in a markdown format
- [69:23] and it's super important that you make
- [69:25] sure that the offer that gets returned
- [69:28] to us doesn't include any additional
- [69:30] commentary it only includes the updated
- [69:34] offer period do you have any questions
- [69:36] before you go off and incorporate this
- [69:40] new tool calling functionality inside of
- [69:42] our backend route so as you can see
- [69:45] we're definitely going to go a little
- [69:46] bit deeper in this one we're starting to
- [69:48] you know really put our hats on when it
- [69:49] comes to working with some of these
- [69:51] modern tools but I know a lot of
- [69:52] tutorials just show a bunch of like
- [69:53] flashy stuff I want to show you guys a
- [69:55] lot of actual functionality that you can
- [69:58] actually crank out using these tools so
- [70:00] you can see it did a great job of
- [70:02] creating a you know basically updating
- [70:04] our chat route to include a new tool
- [70:06] this is exactly what we wanted current
- [70:08] offer feedback yes this is exactly what
- [70:11] we're looking for perfect I love the way
- [70:14] that this looks so we can go ahead and
- [70:16] paste this over here into our code great
- [70:20] makes our life so much easier and what
- [70:22] we can do now is you can see it's not
- [70:24] actually doing anything with the offer
- [70:28] not a big fan of that right now but I
- [70:31] think that is totally fine cuz later
- [70:33] we'll actually start working on that
- [70:35] let's see if there's anything else I
- [70:36] want to change let me look at this real
- [70:37] fast for you guys yeah the only thing
- [70:39] that I think we should change is adding
- [70:40] in some sort of system message before we
- [70:44] go off and just accepting anything so
- [70:46] you can see there's a system output or
- [70:48] property right here so what we can do is
- [70:50] just add it to do and just tell AI to
- [70:52] work on it for us so whenever we went to
- [70:54] like start telling basically to spin up
- [70:56] a new conversation you can just hit
- [70:58] command L again and then actually have
- [71:00] it start incorporating feedback so in
- [71:02] our case we're just going to say hey
- [71:03] I've added a to-do to the system
- [71:06] property inside of the stream text
- [71:08] function and basically I would like for
- [71:10] you to add a prompt saying that hey
- [71:12] you're a helpful assistant who's helping
- [71:14] real estate agents create offer you're
- [71:16] going to go off and provide a quick
- [71:19] summary of the changes that you've made
- [71:21] to the offer without repeating the
- [71:23] entire offer and here is what the
- [71:26] current offer looks like and what you're
- [71:28] going to do is you add in some string
- [71:29] interpolation that's going to take in
- [71:32] the offer that was passed in during the
- [71:35] initial request Json so what we're
- [71:37] trying to do guys just so we're both on
- [71:39] the same page is whenever we go off and
- [71:41] start working with updating our offers
- [71:43] so let me just show you whenever we
- [71:45] start updating these offers what we want
- [71:46] to do is go like hey please update this
- [71:49] to $300,000 so two things need to happen
- [71:51] at once a we need to call the tool which
- [71:54] is going to generate the updated offer
- [71:56] and part two is we need to generate a
- [71:58] response that we can show to our user
- [72:00] and in order to do that we need to start
- [72:01] taking actions and listen to what the
- [72:03] heck this initial offer was in the first
- [72:05] place so this it looks perfect so we can
- [72:08] just apply it great now we're going to
- [72:10] actually use the offer that was passed
- [72:12] in at least we should be offer let's get
- [72:15] rid of that there we go now things are
- [72:18] looking great and for some reason this
- [72:20] is not using the proper version of
- [72:23] actually chat completions so once again
- [72:25] this is where working with these updated
- [72:27] models doesn't work properly so what you
- [72:30] can do is say hey there's basically a
- [72:32] better way to do this in our case it's
- [72:34] going to be using let me just show you
- [72:36] generate text yeah perfect so what we
- [72:39] can do is come down here and say we'll
- [72:41] just actually get this fixed so you can
- [72:42] select the code and you're going to hit
- [72:44] command L and we're going to talk about
- [72:45] it so we're going to say hey this is
- [72:47] actually not the proper way to use open
- [72:50] AI to go off and generate text summaries
- [72:54] you need to use the generate text
- [72:56] function from the AI Library which will
- [72:59] take in a model and a prompt and it will
- [73:02] turn a response so in our case it's
- [73:05] going to be the updated offer do you
- [73:08] have any questions before you return the
- [73:11] updated code so that'll go off and it
- [73:14] should go ahead and update our yep code
- [73:16] looks great let's accept it looks great
- [73:19] now it's just trying to call updated
- [73:20] offer but what we're trying to do in our
- [73:23] case is we don't want to return just do
- [73:25] trim which is this is you know updated
- [73:27] offer is actually a it's a full-on
- [73:29] response so you can see this is like a
- [73:31] generated text response so in our case
- [73:33] that's not what we want in our case what
- [73:34] we want to do is like hey I want to grab
- [73:36] the text out of this generated text and
- [73:38] now I just want to return the updated
- [73:40] offer so now we're returning just text
- [73:41] back to our users this is exactly what
- [73:43] we want okay so we just did a lot and
- [73:45] I'm going to give a quick recap of what
- [73:47] we did we made a new tool that is an
- [73:49] updated offer what it's going to do is
- [73:51] it's going to take in the current offer
- [73:53] plus feedback and it's going to spit
- [73:56] back out an updated offer now from there
- [73:59] what it's going to do is we're going to
- [74:01] take all of that there's the updated
- [74:03] prompt we're going to add that in to a
- [74:05] new open AI generate text we're going to
- [74:08] go off and actually take action on it
- [74:09] let AI work its magic incorporating
- [74:11] feedback in the offer and from there
- [74:13] what we're going to do is go ahead and
- [74:15] return that offer back to the front end
- [74:18] so this looks great now it's up to us on
- [74:21] the front end to start handling working
- [74:24] with this basically uh start working
- [74:26] with this return data and I like to keep
- [74:28] things a little bit structured so what
- [74:30] we can do is to actually like make this
- [74:33] a little bit better because right now
- [74:34] we're just going to return text but I'd
- [74:36] like to actually return a object so what
- [74:38] we can do is once again select this
- [74:41] command L and then we can say can you
- [74:43] please convert this over to an object
- [74:45] that has two properties a confirmation
- [74:49] which just says Hey I've updated the
- [74:51] offer to incorporate your feedback and
- [74:54] then an updated offer property which
- [74:57] will actually be the updated offer that
- [74:59] was just
- [75:00] generated so now what we can do is on
- [75:02] the front in we whenever we get back
- [75:04] this tool call we can actually dig into
- [75:07] the updated offer so you can see this is
- [75:09] exactly what we wanted great this is
- [75:11] exactly what we want so now we're going
- [75:12] to get an object back on the front end
- [75:14] when it comes to dealing with our tool
- [75:15] calls okay so that was a lot don't worry
- [75:17] if tool calls were a little weird once
- [75:19] you actually see this in action you're
- [75:20] going to be like wow that is so powerful
- [75:22] I now in my open AI calls can go off and
- [75:24] add a bunch of tools so hopefully this
- [75:26] was pretty eye opening to see how we're
- [75:27] starting to use AI to help automate
- [75:30] things and start working with some
- [75:31] cooler new technologies so now that
- [75:32] we've done this we can actually head
- [75:34] back over to chat over here and actually
- [75:36] start incorporating some of this
- [75:37] feedback so we can actually you know
- [75:39] once we start making request over to API
- [75:42] chat with our offers we can actually
- [75:44] start actually getting back the offer
- [75:46] and start updating our offer modal so
- [75:47] let's go ahead and start working on that
- [75:48] next so first things first what we're
- [75:50] going to do we're going to hop back over
- [75:51] to our docs which include all the
- [75:54] information that we need when it comes
- [75:55] to actually pulling out these tool
- [75:57] results so let me show you what is
- [75:59] happening and explain why I'm about to
- [76:01] go off and tell VZ what it needs to do
- [76:04] so you can see whenever we're looking at
- [76:06] a tool call um so this is just a chat
- [76:08] component you can see that there is a
- [76:11] what they're doing is handling like an a
- [76:13] local client side tool call we're not
- [76:15] worrying about that the thing that we
- [76:16] are worried about is when ever we notice
- [76:20] one of our messages that we received
- [76:22] back from open aai includes some sort of
- [76:25] a tool call in our case what we want to
- [76:28] do is go ahead and say oh that tool call
- [76:31] included an updated offer great let me
- [76:34] go grab the result so let me grab the
- [76:37] result and go ahead and actually add it
- [76:40] over to our offer component over to the
- [76:43] side so basically hey was a tool called
- [76:45] in one of our messages great I'm going
- [76:47] to grab that latest updated offer and
- [76:50] add it over here okay so what we're
- [76:52] going to do let's go ahead and actually
- [76:53] tell open AI sorry v0 how to do all this
- [76:57] so first things first whenever you're
- [76:58] working with something like this I just
- [76:59] like to go ahead and grab the example so
- [77:01] that you and the AI are on the same page
- [77:04] so I'm going to go ahead and paste it in
- [77:05] here and explain what we want to get
- [77:07] done so we're just going to say like
- [77:08] this is the example code and then one
- [77:11] more time we're just going to hop back
- [77:12] over and give it our code just to make
- [77:15] sure that we're on the same page and go
- [77:17] ahead and start telling it what it needs
- [77:19] to do so let's start walking through it
- [77:21] together I just set up the functionality
- [77:25] that you just created for updating an
- [77:27] offer inside of our chat route so I set
- [77:31] up that open aai tool call and now what
- [77:34] I want to do is start handling getting
- [77:36] back tool call results on our front- end
- [77:40] code so as you can see in the example
- [77:43] that I just gave you they are iterating
- [77:46] through each of the messages that open
- [77:48] AI gives them back and whenever they
- [77:51] recognize that a specific tool was
- [77:53] called they add that result to start
- [77:56] working with inside of their code
- [77:57] example now what we need to do inside of
- [78:01] our code is we want to go off sorry I
- [78:04] was lagging for a second and we want to
- [78:07] go off and extract that tool call result
- [78:11] which should be a update offer and with
- [78:16] that update offer we want to actually
- [78:19] update the offer that is being passed To
- [78:21] Us by our parent component because
- [78:24] ultimately what we're trying to do is
- [78:26] update the offer in our chat window pass
- [78:28] the updated offer to our parent which
- [78:30] will then eventually be passed back over
- [78:32] and the offer component that we created
- [78:35] earlier period do you have any questions
- [78:37] before you go off and Implement all of
- [78:40] these
- [78:41] changes so that was a that was a gnarly
- [78:44] one guys so I hope you can uh let me
- [78:45] just like walk you through what was
- [78:46] happening so whenever I was saying like
- [78:48] hey we are working in a chat component
- [78:51] that's going to be getting you know
- [78:52] messages and eventually one of these is
- [78:54] going to be like a tool call well
- [78:56] whenever you get the tool call what we
- [78:58] want to happen is to actually go ahead
- [79:00] and say cool pass it up to our parent so
- [79:03] this offer detail because this offer
- [79:05] detail is what has the offer that's
- [79:08] being shared between both of our
- [79:11] different components because the offer
- [79:13] that same offer is getting shared into
- [79:15] here and it's getting shared over into
- [79:18] this so we want to make changes here
- [79:21] then actually share send it back up to
- [79:22] our parent because our parents going to
- [79:24] send it back down over to our sibling
- [79:26] component so this is just more standard
- [79:28] nextjs in react sharing State between
- [79:30] different components so let's see how
- [79:33] it's handling it so I understand the
- [79:34] requirements we need to update this
- [79:36] component to handle update offer tool
- [79:38] calls and update both of them okay so
- [79:41] what does the updated code look like so
- [79:44] let's just go a and copy paste it come
- [79:45] over here paste it and start seeing what
- [79:48] the damage is guys so you can see we're
- [79:50] now passing up sorry we're still
- [79:53] chatting we're now going to start
- [79:55] passing a body which is going to be our
- [79:56] local offer then what we're going to do
- [80:00] is anytime we finish we're going to
- [80:02] handle a tool call so what does handle
- [80:05] tool call do well in our case we're
- [80:06] going to say if message was you know a
- [80:08] tool invitation we want to check to see
- [80:11] if it was the update offer because if it
- [80:13] was we want to grab that result which is
- [80:16] the new offer content and we want to set
- [80:19] the local offer now here's where things
- [80:21] get a little bit tricky and this is
- [80:23] where we can use v0 the glue because
- [80:25] that's how I sorry how we can use cursor
- [80:27] as the glue so what I like to do is go
- [80:30] inside of our backend route we're
- [80:32] returning a inside of our chat you can
- [80:34] see we're returning back an object like
- [80:37] a confirmation update offer so what we
- [80:39] can see is like hey I would like you to
- [80:42] look at this file to see what we're
- [80:43] returning and actually make sure that
- [80:45] we're handling it appr appropriately so
- [80:48] you can do command L to chat about a
- [80:50] specific piece of code and then you can
- [80:52] do at and talk about the specific file
- [80:55] that you want to so in our case it's the
- [80:56] chat route and we can say when you look
- [80:59] at the return of our chat endpoint
- [81:02] whenever we're doing the tool update
- [81:05] offer call you'll notice that we're
- [81:07] returning an object period however
- [81:09] inside the handle tool calls function
- [81:11] when we're working with update offer
- [81:13] we're just grabbing out the text can you
- [81:15] please update handle tool calls to
- [81:18] properly grab the offer from our backend
- [81:22] endpoint so fingers crossed I we know
- [81:24] we're just trying this together but you
- [81:25] can see it should be grabbing it yes and
- [81:28] that is awesome and it's extracting all
- [81:30] the proper information that's exactly
- [81:31] what we would want awesome so you can
- [81:33] see like it is the glue that goes yeah
- [81:35] look over here now fix this here I love
- [81:37] I love cursor for that this looks great
- [81:40] now what we can do is just to make sure
- [81:42] that this is working to we can go ahead
- [81:44] and do a log as well and yeah oh another
- [81:47] thing that I like to do with cursor is
- [81:50] i' like to use it to add logs because
- [81:52] adding logs is it's just timec consuming
- [81:54] so I always hop over to mini and then I
- [81:56] just say hey can you please add a bunch
- [81:58] of logs to this
- [82:01] function so it'll go off and just you
- [82:03] see how fast it is it's just cranking
- [82:04] out all of them so normally that would
- [82:06] have taken you and I a bunch of time to
- [82:07] code out but hey there's no reason for
- [82:09] that so hopefully that's another helpful
- [82:10] tip as you guys go off and start using
- [82:12] this technology all right so what we can
- [82:14] do now is we can start saying and we're
- [82:16] going to be doing some troubleshooting
- [82:17] here just to set expectations so we're
- [82:19] going to go ahead and open up our
- [82:20] inspector hop over to console and we're
- [82:22] going to go ahead and try start to
- [82:24] actually make some changes to our offer
- [82:27] over here to the side so we're going to
- [82:29] say hey can you please update the
- [82:31] current offer from $500,000 to 300,000
- [82:36] now this should go off and actually
- [82:37] start doing some tool calling and
- [82:39] hopefully give us back some actual
- [82:41] answers so we can also come over here
- [82:43] into our code and actually see what's
- [82:46] going on so you can see right now we're
- [82:49] calling everything yeah we're calling
- [82:51] the offers endpoint the offer was
- [82:53] updated and you can see when we look at
- [82:56] our code that we got a received message
- [83:00] and the purchase price has been off
- [83:02] offered and this is where things start
- [83:04] to actually kind of fall apart when it
- [83:06] comes to working with some of the
- [83:08] updated docs because you can see it said
- [83:11] hey no tool call was found but we
- [83:14] actually did you know call a tool so
- [83:17] this actually has to do with the fact
- [83:19] that our I'll just show you the actual
- [83:20] issue real fast and how we can fix it so
- [83:23] if you come back over to the chat window
- [83:25] so the current issue is onfinish only to
- [83:29] text messages it doesn't actually
- [83:31] officially handle when tools get called
- [83:33] it only handles raw messages so you and
- [83:36] I need to go in and add a new function
- [83:40] called handle new message and that
- [83:42] handle new message is basically just
- [83:44] going to actually scrape through all the
- [83:45] messages and once it finds a tool call
- [83:48] then we'll go and update it so let me
- [83:49] show you exactly what I mean and how we
- [83:51] can fix this together so we're going to
- [83:52] head back over to VZ Z and have it
- [83:55] actually work well first off what we're
- [83:57] going to do is paste in our code cuz you
- [83:58] know things kind of get out of state
- [84:00] whenever we make some changes with
- [84:01] cursor and then eventually go back over
- [84:03] and make some changes with vzer so we
- [84:05] need to keep them on the same page so
- [84:07] that's why I pasted in now here's what
- [84:08] we can say to v0 to hopefully get it to
- [84:11] start recognizing the problem and how we
- [84:13] can fix it so this is where you as a
- [84:15] software developer like can't always
- [84:16] 100% lean on AI solving the problem for
- [84:18] you sometimes you have to like do some
- [84:20] digging and that's what I had to do is
- [84:22] figure like why the heck are our tool
- [84:24] callings not showing up in onfinish and
- [84:27] then I looked and I was like oh anything
- [84:28] that is a tool call never appears inside
- [84:31] of an onfinish so I think it's just
- [84:34] because tool calls are intermediate
- [84:36] steps before a final answer so it
- [84:38] doesn't show intermediate steps is
- [84:39] actually what I've kind of deduced so
- [84:41] here's how we can do this together guys
- [84:43] so what we can do is say onfinish is not
- [84:46] properly detecting on tool calls so what
- [84:49] I would like you to do instead is create
- [84:52] a new use effect that monitors all of
- [84:55] the messages inside of use chat and what
- [84:59] I would like you to do inside of that
- [85:01] use effect is call a function named
- [85:04] handle new message and what this handle
- [85:07] new message function should do is look
- [85:11] for the latest messages coming from the
- [85:14] assistant specifically where that
- [85:17] message is a tool invitation and if it's
- [85:20] a tool invitation that called updated
- [85:23] offer and has a result you need to go
- [85:26] ahead and call handle update offer which
- [85:30] should update the offer that is shown in
- [85:33] the offer component over to the side and
- [85:36] it's important to note that we don't
- [85:38] want to cause any weird issues and what
- [85:42] I mean by that is I don't want to
- [85:44] iterate from our first message to our
- [85:47] newest message because there's a world
- [85:49] to where there was actually three or
- [85:50] four different tool calls in there so
- [85:53] what you should do is work from bottom
- [85:55] up and what I mean by that is you should
- [85:58] look at the oldest newest messages first
- [86:02] and if you happen to find a tool call
- [86:04] break out of this handle message Loop
- [86:07] until a new message comes in do you have
- [86:10] any questions before you start
- [86:11] implementing this new updated logic all
- [86:14] right so while that's generating let me
- [86:15] just quickly explain to you guys what
- [86:16] actually the heck I just mentioned so
- [86:18] what I was trying to tell the AI is
- [86:20] basically in case v0 is we want to as
- [86:23] you can see there's an updated offer
- [86:25] here well there's a chance that they did
- [86:27] another offer right here to say hey it
- [86:29] needs to be $1 million well in that case
- [86:32] it wouldn't make sense to start handling
- [86:34] things like this way to where we like oh
- [86:36] I found an offer quick update over here
- [86:39] oh I found another offer cool let's
- [86:40] update the offer modal again because in
- [86:43] one conversation every time we add a new
- [86:45] message it'll start from the top and
- [86:47] like ding yep update ding update and
- [86:50] that's just going to cause some weird
- [86:51] glitching and flickering so us trying to
- [86:53] be a little bit proactive we go put our
- [86:55] problem solving hats on and go oh I want
- [86:57] to look from bottom up so newest to
- [87:00] oldest and the second I find anything
- [87:04] that has an offer updated like this I
- [87:06] will stop going back up the chain
- [87:09] because there's no reason to update the
- [87:10] offer with older offers so hopefully
- [87:12] that makes sense so let's keep going
- [87:14] back over to v0 and see what they're
- [87:17] adding for us so we removed it great
- [87:19] that's what we asked added a call back
- [87:21] handle a new message all of this is
- [87:23] looking great so let's actually come in
- [87:25] here and see what code they have set up
- [87:28] for us so let's copy paste it and run
- [87:31] through it together so you can now see
- [87:33] what's happening is well first they did
- [87:36] they missed some dependencies so this is
- [87:38] a quick dependency issue this is a react
- [87:40] issue specifically let me walk you
- [87:42] through what just happened so right now
- [87:44] we have handle new message but handle
- [87:46] new message is outside of this use
- [87:48] effect so the quick answer is to just go
- [87:50] ahead and paste it in here and to get
- [87:52] rid of it and then we can update
- [87:54] basically we're just going to run into
- [87:55] some dependency issues with like hey
- [87:57] this use effect needs things that don't
- [87:59] exist so what we can do is go ahead and
- [88:02] update the dependency and then now what
- [88:04] we're going to do is like hey I'm
- [88:06] getting this error cool shift command e
- [88:09] like it says and I'll do it again shift
- [88:11] command e and it'll go ahead and tell us
- [88:13] how to fix it which is to put it in a
- [88:14] use call back and that's exactly what
- [88:16] it's going to do for us oh this is so
- [88:18] cool normally this would have taken a
- [88:20] little bit just to wrap up but you got
- [88:21] to love AI doing it for us so except
- [88:24] it went ahead and update our Imports for
- [88:26] us guys and then outside of that down
- [88:28] here it made a call back and the only
- [88:30] other thing that we need to do is move
- [88:32] that call back above our use effect
- [88:35] looks great now what we can do that
- [88:38] looks great now this one's going to have
- [88:40] a quick issue so handle update offer
- [88:44] Also let's see how many times we're
- [88:45] calling this yeah same thing we just
- [88:47] need to also fix this one so it's shift
- [88:50] command shift command e we'll fix this
- [88:53] one as well by putting it in a call back
- [88:54] so as you can see we are using cursor as
- [88:56] the like hey just fix this and I love it
- [88:59] for that so let's apply the update
- [89:02] accept accept now all we have to do is
- [89:05] just move this function right up top all
- [89:08] right great guys this is looking awesome
- [89:10] so no more errors and what we can do now
- [89:13] is I would like to add some logs in here
- [89:15] so we can prove that yes when an update
- [89:17] offer does come in we accept it so per
- [89:20] usual come in here command L inside a
- [89:23] mini going to say hey can you please add
- [89:26] in some logs whenever we actually do
- [89:29] receive a tool invitation for update
- [89:31] offers so this is going to go off and
- [89:33] get that working for us and then let's
- [89:36] go ahead and that looks great apply it
- [89:39] added the logs awesome now what I want
- [89:42] to do is go ahead and save it so we're
- [89:44] going to run it just so we're on the
- [89:45] same page we're going to run it to make
- [89:46] sure that we are properly you know
- [89:48] receiving and doing an updated tool inv
- [89:50] vacation and then what we're going to do
- [89:52] afterwards is hop over and actually
- [89:54] start finishing up to make sure
- [89:56] basically our offers component over here
- [89:58] it's actually going to start viewing
- [90:00] data because right now it's not showing
- [90:01] anything that's updated it's just static
- [90:03] static text so all right so first things
- [90:06] first let's make sure this is working so
- [90:08] we're going to come over here and say
- [90:10] can you please update the current
- [90:13] listing price of the offer to
- [90:18] $415,000 so we're g to send it then what
- [90:20] we're going to do is we would expect for
- [90:22] it to go off do its thing and then we
- [90:24] should expect it to do some sort of like
- [90:26] yep uh tool is getting called and once
- [90:29] it's done doing its tool call what we
- [90:31] should expect to see is an offer update
- [90:33] log but for whatever reason it didn't
- [90:36] fully call it so what we can do is come
- [90:38] back and check and do a little bit more
- [90:39] live debugging together to figure like
- [90:41] huh why did it not officially update the
- [90:43] offer so let's hop back over here and
- [90:45] look at this together all right so after
- [90:47] some digging I went off and figured out
- [90:49] what was going weird so few things that
- [90:51] we need to change thing one if you
- [90:53] actually look at our code what we're
- [90:55] doing is we're passing in a single
- [90:57] message so whatever the latest message
- [90:59] we're passing that in to our handle new
- [91:00] message the issue is is whenever it
- [91:03] comes to Tool calling inside of open AI
- [91:06] what's actually happening under the hood
- [91:08] is if you actually look you'll see that
- [91:11] a tool invocation has a tool name and
- [91:14] outside of that it has a tool State and
- [91:17] what was happening is that state was not
- [91:20] going that tool invocation state was not
- [91:22] ever result it was at calling so it's
- [91:25] like calling the function waiting for
- [91:26] result so it was getting stuck so that
- [91:28] was the first issue so what we need to
- [91:30] do is we can come in here and we're
- [91:31] going to start using cursor to help us
- [91:34] figure out some of these issues so
- [91:35] instead of passing in the latest message
- [91:37] we're just going to pass in all the
- [91:39] messages now that's going to cause an
- [91:40] issue because our code is set up to
- [91:44] handle only a single message so we're
- [91:46] going to turn this into an array and
- [91:47] then we're going to leave it up to
- [91:49] cursor to get this working for us so
- [91:51] we've added this in and now we're going
- [91:53] to zoom out and use 40 to say hey can
- [91:56] you please refactor this code it was
- [91:58] initially set up to handle a single
- [92:00] message but now I want you to iterate
- [92:02] through all of the messages starting
- [92:05] with the latest messages and then work
- [92:08] back to the beginning great so that's
- [92:11] how we're going to work backwards and
- [92:12] iterate through all of them awesome so
- [92:14] we can go ahead and apply that now
- [92:16] there's also some additional changes
- [92:18] that we need to make uh and we're going
- [92:20] to use cursor for that so I noticed as I
- [92:23] was doing a little bit of research when
- [92:25] it comes to our actual offer what we're
- [92:27] doing is we're passing around an object
- [92:29] of like the offer and then content but
- [92:31] that's really not what we want all we
- [92:33] really want going forward is for all of
- [92:35] our offers to be a string so what we're
- [92:38] going to do now for a very light edits
- [92:40] we're just going to say hey update offer
- [92:42] to be just a string hey can you please
- [92:44] change my code to handle the change
- [92:47] where I just made offer in the props of
- [92:50] string and update that throughout the
- [92:52] rest of my codebase so basically just
- [92:54] drop content offer. content cool so this
- [92:57] will go off and apply all the changes
- [92:59] for us so you can see it's adding it
- [93:00] everywhere apply apply great that looks
- [93:03] great but now what's happening is
- [93:05] there's going to be an issue in the
- [93:06] parent so what we can do is say all
- [93:09] right offer we're no longer going to
- [93:11] worry about this because that was prior
- [93:13] to us going off and making the offer in
- [93:15] our schema so what we can do now is
- [93:17] actually start using our offer from our
- [93:20] schema awesome and then what we can do
- [93:23] is actually just look look inside of
- [93:24] these different components and figure
- [93:26] out what the heck we're passing in so
- [93:27] offer is a string so all we have to do
- [93:30] now is up here in the parent pass around
- [93:32] basically the content cuz what I was
- [93:34] trying to get at is there's actually no
- [93:35] reason for us to pass around the entire
- [93:38] offer and everything else we can
- [93:39] actually just pass along the current one
- [93:41] okay so uh let's go into each one of
- [93:44] these different sections and actually
- [93:46] update it and more specifically guys uh
- [93:49] well yeah we'll go into each one of
- [93:50] these and show it how fix it real fast
- [93:52] and really what we can do do is make
- [93:54] this even more clear because what we
- [93:57] really are trying to pass around is the
- [93:58] offer content and set the offer content
- [94:01] so what we can do is pass in initial
- [94:04] offer. content but that could be null so
- [94:07] what we need to do is have some sort of
- [94:09] default read me or basically some
- [94:11] default offer so this is what we're
- [94:13] going to work on together we're going to
- [94:14] make a new constants file right here and
- [94:17] inside of that constants file we're
- [94:19] going to pass in an offer so this is
- [94:21] like our template that we're going to be
- [94:22] actually filling in together perfect so
- [94:24] what we can do now is say all right I
- [94:26] want my initial offer content to be if
- [94:29] we already have content saved show that
- [94:32] otherwise what I want to do is do the
- [94:34] offer markdown great so now we're going
- [94:36] to have to import that and we're going
- [94:38] to have to update this to be a string
- [94:41] now what we can do is actually go off
- [94:43] and set everything to work so there we
- [94:46] go so what we can do is just come in
- [94:48] here and say I just updated my code to
- [94:50] start using offer content instead of
- [94:53] offer so can you please update my
- [94:55] functions and passing things into my
- [94:57] children components properly so this
- [95:00] will go off and hopefully like I said
- [95:02] now we just get to talk to our code and
- [95:04] things just happen that are beautiful so
- [95:05] apply let's go ahead and apply things
- [95:08] look great guys now there are a few
- [95:10] small issues whenever it comes to that
- [95:13] we need to go off and fix so such as in
- [95:16] these two other CH uh children component
- [95:18] it's still looking for that offer modal
- [95:20] so what we can do is go over to our file
- [95:23] upload component and in here this is
- [95:25] what I love about using cursor now what
- [95:28] we can do is say like hey I have this
- [95:31] chat component that is set up properly
- [95:33] can you please look at those changes and
- [95:35] apply them here so this is exactly what
- [95:36] we're going to do please look at the at
- [95:39] chat
- [95:41] component and in that chat component
- [95:43] you'll see that we're passing in the
- [95:45] offer content as a string can you please
- [95:48] look at how we're applying and passing
- [95:51] in that offer content prop and apply
- [95:54] those same changes here so this will go
- [95:57] off look what we were doing make the
- [95:59] changes here and hopefully actually get
- [96:01] everything working great and what you'll
- [96:03] see is like it didn't fully do it so
- [96:05] we'll actually change the model and now
- [96:07] that it's struggling we'll up the ante
- [96:09] and say Hey you actually didn't update
- [96:12] my file upload props to start using the
- [96:16] appropriate offer prop so once again go
- [96:20] look at the chat component and see what
- [96:22] we're doing over there and apply those
- [96:24] same offer props to this file please let
- [96:27] me know if you have any questions and
- [96:28] then per usual we can just add in our
- [96:30] chat so great so now fingers crossed
- [96:33] this one should work and for whatever
- [96:34] reason guys it's still not 100% adding
- [96:37] it in uh I think it's just trying to get
- [96:38] a we're trying to get a little too fancy
- [96:40] with it so all we need to do is just say
- [96:41] string and then now we can say as you
- [96:44] can see I've just changed the offer to
- [96:45] be a string please update the issues
- [96:48] accordingly so now it should go off and
- [96:51] actually get things working properly so
- [96:52] you can see now whenever we're working
- [96:54] with offer it's just offer content so
- [96:56] like I said I was trying to be a little
- [96:57] fancy there for you guys sometimes it
- [96:58] works sometimes it doesn't but hey
- [97:00] that's just the the nature of it and
- [97:01] then same with offer viewer this one's
- [97:03] just going to be a string looks great
- [97:07] and then this one's going to be a string
- [97:10] okay great so now that we have this all
- [97:12] set up let's hop back over to our code
- [97:14] and actually try running it and look at
- [97:16] our logs to make sure that the offer is
- [97:17] getting updated properly and then we'll
- [97:19] close this up by making sure that our
- [97:21] offer viewer is properly showing the
- [97:24] updated offer that we got generated from
- [97:25] open AI so let's hop over to our code
- [97:28] and what we can do is say update the
- [97:31] price of the house to we'll say 600k and
- [97:36] now this should go off start calling the
- [97:37] appropriate tools and we should start to
- [97:39] see that like yes a tool call is being
- [97:42] made so that's a little dot great tool
- [97:44] call is being made and you can see tool
- [97:46] invocation now saying State call but
- [97:49] then you can see received offer update
- [97:51] tool invocation with the result and you
- [97:53] can see that like now we have the
- [97:54] updated offer which is exactly what we
- [97:57] wanted and now what we're going to start
- [97:59] doing is actually going off in getting
- [98:01] this rightand section of the code to
- [98:04] work and what the first thing that we
- [98:06] need to do is actually make sure we're
- [98:07] grabbing the current offer because
- [98:10] nowhere in our code have we said
- [98:11] recently hey I'm working on 123 Main
- [98:14] Street this is not what we've been
- [98:15] working on so if you actually head back
- [98:17] over to our code and go over to our page
- [98:20] what you'll notice is we have this get
- [98:22] initial offer which is not what we
- [98:24] wanted to do at all what we wanted to do
- [98:26] was to get our current offer and then
- [98:28] pass it down to our children so we're
- [98:30] actually just in a weird state from the
- [98:32] get-go so this is what we're going to do
- [98:34] we're going to actually go off and fetch
- [98:36] our offer from our back end and how are
- [98:39] we going to do this well this is a
- [98:40] perfect time to start using v0 to make
- [98:42] another query because this is a serers
- [98:45] side component to fetch this specific
- [98:47] offer so let me show you how we can
- [98:48] start doing that in v0 so we can head
- [98:50] back over here and we can say let's
- [98:53] actually C copy all of our code and
- [98:54] paste it in and we can start telling it
- [98:56] what did it do wrong hey can you please
- [98:59] help me update my offer page which is a
- [99:03] serers side component which is supposed
- [99:05] to be fetching the current offer based
- [99:08] off of the ID we are passing in so what
- [99:11] I would like for you to do is in our
- [99:13] queries. TS file can you create a new
- [99:16] query which will get an offer by its ID
- [99:19] and pass it back to us and once you find
- [99:21] that offer can you please then pass it
- [99:23] down into our child offer detail
- [99:26] component so what we would expect this
- [99:29] to go do is make a new query for us and
- [99:31] clean up our code so let's see if v0 can
- [99:33] pull through in this final test so
- [99:36] fingers crossed it does does all the
- [99:37] work for us and I'm going to go ahead
- [99:39] and open up our queries page so that we
- [99:41] can go ahead and prepare to go ahead and
- [99:43] paste in our proper code so you can see
- [99:45] we now have get offer by ID it's exactly
- [99:48] what we would want and then outside of
- [99:50] that what we can do is say like all
- [99:51] right is our server set code calling it
- [99:54] now well it should be so when we head
- [99:56] back over here and paste in our code you
- [99:58] can see that now it's trying to call
- [100:01] that function and we can import it like
- [100:03] we have been looks great let me make
- [100:05] that a little bit bigger for you guys
- [100:07] looks great and now what we can do is go
- [100:09] ahead and start trying to run it one
- [100:12] more time and see what's going to happen
- [100:13] so this is exactly what we would expect
- [100:15] to happen first of all like it's a blank
- [100:17] template now that's exactly what we'd
- [100:19] want so let's uh let's make sure let's
- [100:21] try one more time to make sure it's
- [100:23] working and then we can later come in
- [100:24] and actually go ahead and make sure
- [100:26] changes over here propagate to over here
- [100:28] so can you please update the offer
- [100:32] letter to show a purchase price of and
- [100:37] then 400k so what they should do go off
- [100:40] get the tool result per usual we'll go
- [100:42] ahead and open up the logs so you can
- [100:44] see what the heck's actually happening
- [100:47] and let's go ahead and see for whatever
- [100:49] reason handling new message takes a few
- [100:52] seconds tool indication getting kicked
- [100:53] off and then we're going to start
- [100:55] getting back the results which should
- [100:57] include our updated price so for
- [100:59] whatever reason it always just takes a
- [101:00] little bit sometimes working with these
- [101:02] open AI tools great so now you can see
- [101:05] that whenever we got back an updated
- [101:07] $400,000 purchase price this is exactly
- [101:10] what we were trying to do and then let's
- [101:12] go even deeper cuz this is so cool and
- [101:13] I'm so excited that we got here together
- [101:15] can you please update the buyers's name
- [101:17] to Brandon Hancock and the seller name
- [101:20] to Jon Snow and then when it comes to
- [101:24] loan type make that conventional and
- [101:26] make the loan term 30 years fixed so
- [101:29] this is a much larger request that we're
- [101:32] trying to do because now we're updating
- [101:34] multiple variables so what should be
- [101:37] happening is now our tool call will take
- [101:38] in our feedback that's a lot more
- [101:40] complicated and it will go off and
- [101:43] hopefully update our code so let's see
- [101:45] what's going on over here so it should
- [101:48] take a few seconds to handle new message
- [101:51] and eventually come back to us like I
- [101:52] said it it was just taking a second yeah
- [101:54] so it's it's making the call now we just
- [101:57] got to wait for it to actually come back
- [101:58] and do its thing and there are ways to
- [102:00] make this faster right now we're using
- [102:02] CH uh cat GPT 4 Turbo you could easily
- [102:05] change this to GPT 4 o mini and it would
- [102:07] work a lot faster but we just right now
- [102:10] for uh we're just testing everything out
- [102:12] so great offer updated so now what we
- [102:14] should hopefully see is things slowly
- [102:16] start getting updated yeah and for
- [102:18] whatever reason it didn't grab it so
- [102:19] let's quickly dive in to figure out like
- [102:21] why the first change was applied but not
- [102:23] the second so this will be the final
- [102:25] debugging that we do together before we
- [102:27] wrap things up all right guys so welcome
- [102:29] back after some digging around I figured
- [102:30] out what the heck the issue was and we
- [102:32] got to blame AI for it so the small
- [102:35] issue was whenever we did the quick
- [102:37] refactor to change this from a single
- [102:41] for Loop where we were iterating through
- [102:43] each message to whenever we started to
- [102:45] iterate through all messages now here
- [102:47] was the issue when we break out of this
- [102:50] for Loop it just breaks out of this for
- [102:52] Loop it doesn't stop us from going
- [102:54] through the rest of our messages so as a
- [102:57] result what was happening is we had you
- [103:00] know so this was a tool call tool call
- [103:03] tool call so this was like our latest
- [103:05] one and then this one was our earliest
- [103:08] so what was happening is like okay even
- [103:10] though we agreed that you know we were
- [103:12] going to start doing even though we
- [103:13] agreed that we were going to start going
- [103:15] and only looking at the latest tool call
- [103:18] what was happening is it was actually
- [103:19] still taking us all the way back up and
- [103:22] going all right update the latest one
- [103:24] ooh there's another tool call let's get
- [103:26] the previous one so it was going back
- [103:27] and actually even though we were
- [103:29] properly generating the right
- [103:30] information it was just going back and
- [103:32] setting all the way to the earliest tool
- [103:33] call which is not what we wanted so the
- [103:36] Quick Fix is just to change this to a
- [103:38] return which will completely break out
- [103:39] of this Loop entirely so now let me show
- [103:42] you this in action so we're going to say
- [103:44] hey can you please in the wrong so we're
- [103:46] say hey can you please update the price
- [103:50] to you know 430k
- [103:53] and the buyer to Brandon now this should
- [103:57] go off and go ahead and start changing
- [103:59] our buyer to my name and then the next
- [104:02] one's going to hopefully be our property
- [104:04] you know and then change the price as
- [104:05] well and I'm going to go ahead and start
- [104:06] typing up another one just so we have it
- [104:08] cued and ready to go so we're going to
- [104:10] say
- [104:11] actually the price was
- [104:15] 455k and then so you can see
- [104:17] automatically it changed the buyer name
- [104:19] to Brandon and the purchase price to 430
- [104:21] so now it's up to us to make it even
- [104:22] more complex to make sure things are
- [104:24] working so we're going to say can you
- [104:27] actually update the loan term to 30
- [104:29] years fixed and the seller to John S
- [104:31] snow now what's going to happen is it's
- [104:33] actually going to go off and still do
- [104:35] the tool call properly like it was doing
- [104:37] except now we have updated our code to
- [104:40] properly check for the latest tool call
- [104:42] that was the fix so it was a simple
- [104:44] simple programming error and it happened
- [104:46] just because we used AI to quickly add
- [104:49] in a fix and we weren't careful about
- [104:51] the actual repercussions so that's one
- [104:52] of the the best parts of these tools
- [104:53] they're fast but you got to be careful
- [104:55] but yeah now you can see Jon Snow is
- [104:57] properly updated and you can see that
- [105:00] the L term has been updated to 30 years
- [105:02] fixed so this is perfect it's actually
- [105:04] working in to end and once again guys I
- [105:07] know that was like kind of a quick run
- [105:08] through I just wanted to Showcase how
- [105:10] you can use vzer and our three-phase
- [105:12] approach and how you can start using
- [105:14] yeah vzer Claud and cursor all together
- [105:17] to like really crank out an app very
- [105:18] quickly that was very fast that we did
- [105:20] that but if you want to take things even
- [105:22] further and actually dive deep into
- [105:24] building out this application that we've
- [105:25] kind of worked on together I am
- [105:27] uploading it over to my AI developer
- [105:30] accelerator Pro I'll have a entire subm
- [105:32] module where I walk you guys through
- [105:33] more some of the things that we sped
- [105:34] through such as setting up the database
- [105:36] and I'll take you guys a little bit
- [105:38] further over into actually like setting
- [105:40] things up so you can see here's like a
- [105:42] final version of what you'll see in the
- [105:45] the mini crash course so you'll see hey
- [105:47] can you please update the buyer name to
- [105:50] Brandon Hancock number two
- [105:53] and the seller to Jon Snow 2 as well as
- [105:57] change the loan type to FHA so what you
- [106:01] can see now is we have nice loading
- [106:02] screens we have loading screens here
- [106:04] that's all awesome and then outside of
- [106:06] that what you can see is we're also
- [106:07] going to give the ability to upload
- [106:09] files so this is like in the final
- [106:11] complete version of the application this
- [106:13] is what you'll see in the mini course
- [106:15] and I think you already saw the yeah so
- [106:17] it's all working FHA number two John
- [106:19] snow it's all working and we added in
- [106:22] the ab ability let me just show you real
- [106:23] fast final thing just cuz I think this
- [106:25] is so cool what we can have is our
- [106:29] conversations autogenerate and once
- [106:31] again go off autogenerate all the code
- [106:33] and a few things that we left out in
- [106:34] this quick module were the fact that it
- [106:36] didn't go off and actually save and
- [106:38] Export the code so we can work on that
- [106:40] together so now we can save it come back
- [106:42] over to our list view which in our case
- [106:45] is Right Here and Now what you can see
- [106:48] is like yep we generated AI content for
- [106:51] this specific client hop back over and
- [106:53] you can see yep that's exactly what we
- [106:54] were doing so all around super cool this
- [106:56] is in the subm module of the AI
- [106:58] developer accelerator Pro program so
- [107:00] definitely check that out I have a link
- [107:01] down description below all right guys
- [107:02] and that's a wrap for this video I hope
- [107:04] you guys are psyched to start using
- [107:06] Claude v0 and cursor inside of your own
- [107:09] applications I can't wait to see what
- [107:11] you guys go off and build using this
- [107:12] super cool AI Tech stack I also wanted
- [107:15] to share a few different links with you
- [107:16] guys just as a quick reminder if you're
- [107:18] looking for some additional help and you
- [107:20] just want to meet some additional
- [107:21] like-minded AI develop ERS I have that
- [107:23] free school Community down below I think
- [107:25] you guys will love it and we have our
- [107:26] free coaching calls every Tuesday
- [107:28] outside of that if you're looking for
- [107:29] some additional support to master AI
- [107:31] development I just launched a fullstack
- [107:34] AI development course that teaches you
- [107:35] how to use Ai and fullstack development
- [107:38] to automate workflows definitely love it
- [107:40] a ton of great reviews on it definitely
- [107:42] check that out inside the free school
- [107:43] community and also if you want to see
- [107:45] the code behind this application for the
- [107:47] full stack real estate agent I actually
- [107:49] have that over in my AI developer
- [107:51] accelerator Pro community over in school
- [107:53] but I have links to everything down
- [107:54] below if anything was confusing and I
- [107:56] can't wait to see you guys in the next
- [107:58] video I have a ton of other free YouTube
- [108:00] related AI content right here on this
- [108:02] channel so I can't wait to see you guys
- [108:03] in the next video have a great one see
- [108:05] you
