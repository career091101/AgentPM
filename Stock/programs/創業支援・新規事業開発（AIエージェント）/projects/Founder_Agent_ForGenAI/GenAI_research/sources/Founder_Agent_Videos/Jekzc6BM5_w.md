- [00:00] In this video, I will show you how you
- [00:01] can build your first AI agent in less
- [00:04] than 20 minutes. No coding experience
- [00:06] required. No prior technical background
- [00:09] needed. We are going to use a leading AI
- [00:11] automation platform called Zapier. Let's
- [00:14] jump into our problem statement. Now, we
- [00:16] are going to build a customer support AI
- [00:18] agent for an online e-learning company
- [00:22] and that company is my own company
- [00:24] codebasics. We have this platform
- [00:26] codebasics.io IO where we have boot
- [00:28] camps, courses, etc. We have more than
- [00:32] half million registered users on this
- [00:34] platform and we have a team of software
- [00:37] engineers, video editors, customer care
- [00:39] representatives, etc. We obviously get
- [00:42] lot of emails and I'm showing you my
- [00:45] actual email inbox. You see 10,000
- [00:48] emails and we get all these emails, you
- [00:50] know, is there a job placement? Okay,
- [00:52] I'm trying to buy machine learning
- [00:53] course but I have this question. There
- [00:55] are tons of emails that we get and our
- [00:58] learner experience team or customer
- [01:01] support team takes care of these emails.
- [01:04] Now Vishal is one of the members of our
- [01:07] learner experience team and he gets
- [01:09] bombarded with all these questions. He's
- [01:12] very passionate about education and he
- [01:14] writes responses based on the reference
- [01:17] material that we have. So let's say if
- [01:19] someone is asking okay what is your
- [01:21] refund policy? that policy will be
- [01:23] mentioned in our course brochure or it
- [01:26] will be in some Excel containing FAQs.
- [01:29] So we have all this reference material
- [01:32] that contains the truth you know that
- [01:34] that contains the answers and our
- [01:38] customer care representatives will look
- [01:40] into that material and they will respond
- [01:42] to a learner questions. Uh after some
- [01:46] time they will get trained and they will
- [01:47] know how to respond it even without
- [01:49] looking into that material. Now to
- [01:52] reduce their workload we can build an AI
- [01:56] agent that will have access to same
- [01:59] reference material and it can produce
- [02:01] the answer using LLM. Now we know that
- [02:05] LLM can hallucinate and we have a good
- [02:09] brand and good reputation in the market
- [02:12] and we don't want these AI agents to
- [02:14] respond directly. So in the first phase
- [02:18] what we are going to do is we will come
- [02:20] up with a confidence score. So let's say
- [02:23] whatever answer this agent is producing
- [02:25] if it is high confidence then that
- [02:28] answer which will be drafted as an email
- [02:32] will be given to our learner experience
- [02:34] team and they will just hit send button.
- [02:36] Okay. So let's say on average Val takes
- [02:40] 5 minutes to respond to a learner query.
- [02:44] Now since the answer is already drafted
- [02:47] by this AI agent, he will quickly review
- [02:50] it in 10 seconds let's say and he will
- [02:52] hit the send button. So 5 minute is now
- [02:55] reduced to 10 seconds or 15 seconds
- [02:58] which is a huge improvement. If you look
- [03:00] at the scale then there will be some
- [03:02] answers where LLM will not be confident.
- [03:05] Okay. So it says okay I have a low
- [03:07] confidence. So we'll generate a score
- [03:09] between 1 to 10 and let's say if the
- [03:11] score is greater than seven it is high
- [03:14] confidence. So in that case the answer
- [03:16] will be drafted and it will it will be
- [03:18] ready in Vishal's inbox. Okay the draft
- [03:20] will be ready. All he has to do is
- [03:23] review it and click on send button. But
- [03:26] if the score is less than seven, it is
- [03:29] low confidence and we will send a
- [03:32] WhatsApp notification to the mobile
- [03:34] phone that is associated with our
- [03:35] learner experience team and someone from
- [03:39] that team will look into it and they
- [03:41] will draft an email. They will send an
- [03:43] email manually. So this this will be
- [03:45] like old way. Okay. So this will take
- [03:48] still 10 minutes but the hope is that we
- [03:53] can uh handle 80% let's say 80% of our
- [03:57] question if we can handle it with high
- [03:59] confidence that's a huge improvement in
- [04:02] the current process because you already
- [04:04] saw for real we had 10,000 emails if out
- [04:08] of that let's say 8,000 emails okay
- [04:12] which is 80%
- [04:14] are high confidence answer and In every
- [04:17] answer if you are saving let's say 10
- [04:20] minutes or less let's say even if you're
- [04:22] saving 5 minutes okay you are saving
- [04:24] 40,000 minutes of learner experience
- [04:28] team's time okay so that is the goal of
- [04:31] this AI agent now you might have a
- [04:33] question what exactly is an AI agent I
- [04:36] have produced videos on this before so
- [04:37] if you have seen my videos on what is AI
- [04:39] agent you can skip this section
- [04:41] otherwise I will quickly give you an
- [04:43] idea see when you are typing a question
- [04:45] to chat GP GPT chat GPT is powered by
- [04:48] some kind of LLM. Right? So right now it
- [04:50] is GPT 5. If you are using claude it
- [04:54] will be uh claude h high sonate etc. The
- [04:58] model can be anything right? It can be
- [05:00] gemini any model. These models will
- [05:02] produce the answer. Now if the question
- [05:04] is okay plan a 3-day trip to Australia
- [05:06] or how many planets are there in a solar
- [05:09] system it will produce the answer
- [05:10] because this is something it has seen in
- [05:14] pre-training phase. Okay. So these LLM
- [05:17] models are trained till certain
- [05:20] knowledge cutff date and if the question
- [05:23] is in that knowledge it will answer it.
- [05:25] But let's say if you ask this question
- [05:26] what is the price of Emirate flights
- [05:28] from New York to Delhi tomorrow? Well,
- [05:31] it doesn't know that because it has a
- [05:32] knowledge cutff. Let's say this model
- [05:34] was trained on data till December 2024,
- [05:37] it will say okay, I can't answer it. But
- [05:39] you have noticed that if you ask this
- [05:41] question to chat GPT, it will do
- [05:43] internet search and it will still answer
- [05:45] it. Okay, so see this first scenario is
- [05:48] generative AI with only LLM. But chat
- [05:51] GPT is an agentic application. So what
- [05:54] it will do is chatgpt or you can build
- [05:56] your own application where you can have
- [05:58] access to internet you can have access
- [06:00] to expedia API or make my trip.com API
- [06:05] whatever API can give you the latest
- [06:07] flight prices you can give the access of
- [06:10] that API to your LLM and using that API
- [06:14] LLM will be able to produce the answer.
- [06:17] It's like if I tell you that okay a
- [06:19] drill a hole in the wall you won't be
- [06:22] able to do it you are LLM but if I give
- [06:25] you a tool let's say hammer a drill then
- [06:27] you'll be able to do it right because
- [06:29] that is a tool so similarly this Xedia
- [06:31] API is a tool through which it will be
- [06:33] able to produce this answer not only
- [06:36] that you can say okay book me the
- [06:38] cheapest flight and it has access to
- [06:40] Xedia API so what LLM can do is it can
- [06:43] do thinking you might have seen this
- [06:45] thinking prompt you know Whenever you
- [06:47] type any question chat GPT or claude or
- [06:50] Gemini will say thinking. So if you ask
- [06:53] this kind of question uh it will search
- [06:55] for flights you know then it will decide
- [06:58] the cheapest flights. So let's say it
- [07:00] found five flights then it will decide
- [07:02] the cheapest price. Okay this is the
- [07:03] cheapest flights and it will book it.
- [07:05] See this is the big difference folks. So
- [07:07] if you're dealing with chat GPT or any
- [07:10] plane Q&A type LLM app you are asking a
- [07:14] question it is producing the answer. But
- [07:16] what agent will do is it will take an
- [07:19] action. See flight booking is an action
- [07:21] right? See if I'm asking you question
- [07:23] you are given the answer that is simple
- [07:24] Q&A. But here it is booking the flight.
- [07:27] So that is what is the key here in
- [07:30] agent. Okay. So it will say okay flight
- [07:32] booked for $1,200
- [07:34] etc. So this is an AI agent. So AI agent
- [07:38] is a program that takes the input. It
- [07:40] will think and act to complete a task
- [07:43] using tools, memory and knowledge. Okay.
- [07:47] So AI agent will take an action. It is
- [07:50] not just simple Q&A. It will take an
- [07:52] action. Also, it is autonomous. So
- [07:55] autonomous but narrow. Okay. So it it
- [07:58] has some kind of autonomy
- [08:02] where it is taking an action. So in our
- [08:04] case this AI agent has access to tools
- [08:09] such as Gmail or WhatsApp because see
- [08:12] when it is drafting an email it will
- [08:15] draft that email using Gmail or Outlook
- [08:17] whatever is your email tool you can
- [08:20] integrate that with your AI agent and it
- [08:22] is using that right so it is using Gmail
- [08:24] WhatsApp as a tool it also has access to
- [08:27] boot camp brochure FAQ so this is called
- [08:30] knowledge okay so this is knowledge this
- [08:32] is tool it will have its own memory and
- [08:34] using that it will take the question and
- [08:37] it will take some action. So it will go
- [08:40] to your Gmail, it will write an email
- [08:43] actually and put it in a draft. So it
- [08:45] took that autonomous action or if it is
- [08:48] low confidence it will send a
- [08:50] notification on your WhatsApp. See in
- [08:52] both the cases it is taking an
- [08:54] autonomous action and it has access to
- [08:58] tools, knowledge etc. Therefore this is
- [09:01] an AI agent. Let's build this AI agent
- [09:04] in Zapier. Now I will start the timer to
- [09:06] see how much it takes to create this
- [09:08] agent. We are using Zapier which is an
- [09:11] AI automation platform. You can log in
- [09:14] here using your Google account. They
- [09:17] provide a free trial version with some
- [09:19] credits. So we are going to use that. I
- [09:21] have logged in using my account and on
- [09:25] the left hand side you will see this
- [09:27] option for agents. So just click on that
- [09:30] and here we will create a new agent. I
- [09:33] have some previous agent so I'll just
- [09:34] disable them. Okay. And let's create a
- [09:38] new agent by clicking on this button.
- [09:41] They provide a bunch of templates so you
- [09:42] don't have to do the work from scratch.
- [09:45] Here I will select support email agent.
- [09:49] So click on use this template and you
- [09:52] will be asked to link uh to your email
- [09:56] account. So here I have already
- [09:58] connected to my account. In your case
- [10:00] you have a new setup. You will say
- [10:02] connect new account and you will follow
- [10:04] the steps to connect your Gmail account
- [10:06] with this. Click on create and then here
- [10:12] you will be able to modify this prompt.
- [10:15] So they give you by default some prompt.
- [10:19] In our case in code basics we have come
- [10:22] up with this prompt which aligns with
- [10:25] our brand value. Okay. So let me just
- [10:29] copy paste that prompt here. We did some
- [10:31] iteration obviously. So Ctrl Ctrl + V.
- [10:35] And the prompt says that you are an AI
- [10:38] agent supporting the learner experience
- [10:40] team at Code Basics. And when you get
- [10:42] any query, you have to determine the
- [10:44] intent first. And we have two major
- [10:46] products, data analytics boot camp and
- [10:48] data science boot camp. So you figure
- [10:51] out which boot camp it is and you have
- [10:53] to attach your brusher. Okay. So here
- [10:56] let me attach the data science brochure.
- [10:58] So you see this is just a placeholder.
- [11:01] So here put your mouse focus here and
- [11:06] say add tools and then the beauty about
- [11:08] Zepier is that it provides integration
- [11:11] with 7,000 plus applications. So you
- [11:14] click here and connect to your Google
- [11:17] drive. So my brochures are available in
- [11:19] the Google drive here. So this one is a
- [11:23] data science brochure. So say it has
- [11:25] information about the boot camp uh
- [11:28] frequently asked questions what modules
- [11:30] are covered is it online is it
- [11:33] pre-recorded classes you know we have
- [11:35] all that information another brochure is
- [11:38] data analytics boot camp brochure okay
- [11:41] so we are going to provide you all this
- [11:43] material brochure and the prompt
- [11:44] everything so check video description
- [11:46] below and here click on data integration
- [11:50] so in data integration it will ask you
- [11:52] to select your Google account then you
- [11:55] can select your drive. In my drive I
- [11:57] have this email folder where I have kept
- [11:59] my brcher. The first one is a data
- [12:02] science and AI boot camp. So I will
- [12:03] select that. Add a data source. And you
- [12:07] see it has added this source. So I can
- [12:09] remove this placeholder. Whatever is in
- [12:11] bracket I can remove that. And the
- [12:14] second one I will add is data analytics.
- [12:17] So put your mouse cursor here. Follow
- [12:20] the same steps. Okay. Add tools Google
- [12:23] Drive data integration.
- [12:26] Select the account
- [12:29] folder email and DA boot camp brochure.
- [12:33] Okay. Add data source. All right. Then
- [12:36] you have few other uh placeholders as
- [12:39] well. So the first one is Gmail create
- [12:43] draft reply. So put your mouse cursor
- [12:46] here and once again say add tools. So
- [12:50] whenever you have high confidence answer
- [12:53] you want it to connect to your Gmail and
- [12:55] create that draft. So that is what this
- [12:57] tool is. So click on add tools and I
- [13:02] have already created Gmail create draft
- [13:05] reply but let me let me just remove it.
- [13:08] Remove from the agent. Okay. And add it
- [13:11] again. So Gmail in Gmail you will say
- [13:15] create draft reply. See and then remove
- [13:20] that placeholder text that we have. And
- [13:23] the last one is WhatsApp. Okay. So here
- [13:28] if the answers confidence score is less
- [13:31] than seven, you want to notify over
- [13:34] WhatsApp manually. So you'll just say
- [13:37] add tools
- [13:39] and
- [13:40] here WhatsApp just type in WhatsApp
- [13:44] WhatsApp notifications
- [13:47] send a message
- [13:50] and click on this cog wheel to connect
- [13:54] it to your phone number. So here I have
- [13:56] given a phone number of my customer
- [13:58] support team and just say save. That's
- [14:02] it folks. This agent is now ready. You
- [14:06] will enable this agent by clicking on
- [14:09] this. So that way the agent is enabled.
- [14:11] You can do agent preview. You can test
- [14:16] it here. We are going to just test it
- [14:18] directly. Okay. So if you go back
- [14:23] and click on my agents, see whatever
- [14:26] agent we created, it is now ready here.
- [14:30] Now I'm going to ask a question using a
- [14:32] different email id. So I have this email
- [14:35] id. Let's say this person is a student
- [14:38] of code basics or a potential student.
- [14:40] Okay. And they will ask this question.
- [14:44] So code basics is the email id for
- [14:46] customer support team at code basics and
- [14:50] I am going to ask a question
- [14:53] question on DS and AI boot camp. I will
- [14:57] say hey I have a question you know what
- [15:00] is your refund policy
- [15:05] on DS and AI boot camp.
- [15:10] Okay send. So now the email is sent. So
- [15:15] if you look at the email here which is
- [15:17] this particular email. So this is the
- [15:19] email id of customer support team at
- [15:22] code basics and they got a question.
- [15:25] Normally a customer care representative
- [15:28] or from the learner experience team will
- [15:31] manually respond to it. But see we are
- [15:33] not going to do anything. We'll just
- [15:34] wait because the agent is running. So if
- [15:36] you click on it and if you click on
- [15:39] activity
- [15:41] after some pause you will see it
- [15:43] running. So see now after waiting for a
- [15:46] minute or so I'm seeing this in
- [15:49] progress. So the agent is running and
- [15:51] you will see all the steps. Step one is
- [15:53] determining intent. Then it is looking
- [15:56] for answers in the document. So it is
- [15:58] now looking at that particular document.
- [16:01] Okay. And it it kind of found some
- [16:06] matching content. So see it is looking
- [16:09] at it. So we will wait for it to finish
- [16:12] the run. See now it is complete and it
- [16:15] found the answer. It said that okay
- [16:19] answer found you know 100% refund within
- [16:21] 30 days of enrollment and that is
- [16:23] exactly what our policy is. So it's a
- [16:25] 100% accurate answer. It assigned a
- [16:28] score of 9 out of 10. So now let's look
- [16:30] at our email ID. Look at this folks. Do
- [16:33] you see this draft icon? So when I click
- [16:35] on it, see I am Vishal. I'm from
- [16:38] customer care team and I'm sleeping
- [16:40] during the night and it got this
- [16:42] question my agent run and agent created
- [16:46] this draft already. So now see hey there
- [16:49] thank you for reaching out to code a
- [16:50] great question about this. See we offer
- [16:52] 100% refund within 30 days. This is
- [16:55] exactly what Vishal would have responded
- [16:57] in a nice and friendly tone. If you look
- [17:00] at our prompt we are saying okay respond
- [17:02] nicely in a friendly tone because that's
- [17:05] what is our core value.
- [17:08] And now Vishal can just uh click on send
- [17:12] button. Okay. And on the other hand see
- [17:16] I got the response. Thank you for
- [17:19] reaching out. I mean here it says Peter
- [17:21] Panda actually Vishal great question.
- [17:23] See how wonderful this is. You can ask a
- [17:25] different question. Um
- [17:29] where we'll check that WhatsApp
- [17:31] notification flow. Okay. So we'll say
- [17:33] question on data engineering boot camp.
- [17:36] Now we have provided brochure for only
- [17:38] data science and data analytics boot
- [17:40] camp. We have not mentioned anything
- [17:41] about data engineering boot camp. Okay.
- [17:44] So when are you going to launch your
- [17:47] data
- [17:49] engineering boot camp? Okay. So let's
- [17:52] see. Let's send this question. The
- [17:55] question is sent. Our agent should run
- [17:58] in a minute. So see I have received the
- [18:01] question. I will go to my agents tab
- [18:05] and refresh it. It sometimes takes time
- [18:08] but you will see the status here. Okay,
- [18:10] now I'm seeing it. Okay, so it's
- [18:12] running. So it's going step by step.
- [18:15] Let's wait till the execution is done. I
- [18:18] was seeing some errors. So I sent my
- [18:19] email again and the second time it got
- [18:23] completed. See it sent a notification on
- [18:26] WhatsApp because the score confidence
- [18:30] score that it found was below six. There
- [18:34] is no concrete answer on data
- [18:35] engineering boot camp. So when I come to
- [18:38] my WhatsApp okay like whatever number is
- [18:41] configured and if you check you will see
- [18:43] a message on WhatsApp. So you will not
- [18:45] see any email WhatsApp message will be
- [18:48] sent to a relevant person from customer
- [18:51] support team. All right. So, as you can
- [18:54] see, we built our agent actually in less
- [18:58] than 10 minutes. You notice that it's
- [19:01] super easy to build the agents using no
- [19:05] code tools such as Zapier. All you need
- [19:08] is common sense. Common sense plus a
- [19:11] right tool. Using this approach, you can
- [19:13] build your agent just like this. You
- [19:16] don't need to know coding. You don't
- [19:17] need to have a technical background. We
- [19:19] just built a single agent. You can
- [19:22] actually build multiple agents and then
- [19:24] you can have another agent which can
- [19:25] orchestrate all these individual agents.
- [19:28] This is called agentic AI. With agentic
- [19:31] AI you can automate many complex
- [19:33] workflows. Now you might wonder what are
- [19:36] the other tools available in the market
- [19:38] to build agentic AI workflows. Well,
- [19:41] broadly you can categorize them into
- [19:43] these two classes. First one is low code
- [19:46] or no code and second one is using
- [19:49] agentic AI frameworks such as langraph
- [19:51] crew AI etc where you will have to do
- [19:54] coding in the first category the options
- [19:56] that you have is Zepier N8N make etc.
- [20:01] You can pick any one of them all of them
- [20:04] offers free trials. N8N is good for
- [20:07] small projects, but if you are
- [20:09] self-hosting, be ready to handle server
- [20:11] cost, setup, and maintenance. Plus, N8N
- [20:14] updated their pricing model on August 7,
- [20:17] 2025, which has affected majority of
- [20:20] their users running automation at scale.
- [20:23] Zapier, on the other hand, is fully
- [20:25] managed and it does not incur additional
- [20:27] cost like server cost and maintenance
- [20:30] cost. It also provides 8,000 plus
- [20:32] integrations right out of the box which
- [20:35] makes it a better choice for enterprise
- [20:37] scale large projects. All right, I hope
- [20:40] you like this video. Please share it
- [20:42] with your friends who wants to learn
- [20:44] building AI agents without any coding.
