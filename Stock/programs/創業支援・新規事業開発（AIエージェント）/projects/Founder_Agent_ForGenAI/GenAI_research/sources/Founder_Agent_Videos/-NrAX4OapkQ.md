- [00:00] Hello world. It's Suriraj and today I'm
- [00:02] going to show you exactly how I built an
- [00:05] AI agent that made
- [00:09] $2,345 in just 24 hours, all while
- [00:12] taking care of my newborn son. This
- [00:15] isn't some theoretical concept or
- [00:18] exaggerated claim. Let me show you the
- [00:20] actual payment notifications coming in
- [00:23] while I was busy changing diapers. What
- [00:26] you're seeing right now is the Stripe
- [00:28] dashboard from my AI legal document
- [00:31] generator business. As you can see, we
- [00:34] had 24 transactions totaling
- [00:38] 2526 in revenue. After expenses, that's
- [00:43] 1,843 in pure profit generated
- [00:46] completely on autopilot. In the next 20
- [00:49] minutes, I'm going to break down exactly
- [00:52] how I did this step by step, and I'll be
- [00:55] open sourcing the entire codebase so you
- [00:58] can build something similar yourself.
- [01:01] So, there is a huge market gap for legal
- [01:04] documents. Everybody needs legal help,
- [01:07] whether they're starting a business,
- [01:09] whether they're getting a mortgage.
- [01:10] There's so many things that require
- [01:12] lawyers, but lawyers are super
- [01:14] expensive. Not everybody can afford
- [01:16] them. And if you're starting a business,
- [01:18] there's a whole slew of legal docs that
- [01:20] you need to create. Articles of
- [01:21] incorporation, a privacy policy, terms
- [01:24] of service, sometimes an NDA. This is
- [01:27] all expensive. And even if you get a
- [01:29] lawyer, there's a huge time delay to
- [01:31] getting those traditional services. It
- [01:33] takes a long time because the supply is
- [01:36] so limited for this specialized
- [01:38] knowledge. And that is exactly why AI is
- [01:40] perfect for this use case. AI is perfect
- [01:43] for commoditizing domain knowledge,
- [01:45] turning it into a set of weights, a
- [01:48] weight matrix, a file on your computer
- [01:50] that you can download and use for
- [01:52] yourself 24/7. And in this case, it
- [01:55] learned through hundreds of thousands of
- [01:57] legal documents. And then it was able to
- [02:00] translate legal ease, the language of
- [02:02] legal documents that lawyers are
- [02:04] familiar with and go to school for 3
- [02:05] years to understand into plain English
- [02:08] for me to understand. and vice versa. I
- [02:10] could use plain English to generate
- [02:11] legal ease with the help of this tool. I
- [02:14] have never made a legal AI app before.
- [02:16] This was my first time. And the reason I
- [02:18] did it is because of Claude 3.7 sonnet's
- [02:21] suggestion. Claude was really the CEO of
- [02:24] this AI startup. It developed a business
- [02:26] strategy. It decided on this exact
- [02:28] opportunity. The way I got it to tell me
- [02:30] that is by prompting it. I asked it,
- [02:32] "What is the best AI opportunity to make
- [02:34] money in the next 24 hours? Give me the
- [02:36] best idea." And this was the idea. So,
- [02:39] it was really the driving force behind
- [02:40] the idea and it outlined the entire
- [02:43] strategy of how I should build it,
- [02:45] including the landing page, which was
- [02:46] probably the most important part. Claw
- [02:49] generated the landing page for this, but
- [02:52] I needed to then improve it, make it
- [02:54] something that was animated, was really
- [02:56] optimized for conversions, for getting
- [02:59] people to buy on the page. And that's
- [03:00] where V 0ero came in.
- [03:06] Vzero is this great tool for design. It
- [03:09] is perhaps the most popular AI for
- [03:11] design out there right now. And the
- [03:13] reason it's so good is because it's
- [03:14] using all of these JavaScriptbased
- [03:16] animations like Framer and it's
- [03:18] programmatically allowing anybody to
- [03:20] animate and design things in a way that
- [03:23] was not possible before. So that's
- [03:24] really cool. So once Clawude generated
- [03:27] the initial rough landing page, I then
- [03:30] screenshotted that and gave it to V 0ero
- [03:32] to then create a really intense full-on
- [03:35] front-end interface with all the bells
- [03:37] and whistles, all the features needed to
- [03:39] get people to convert. And it did that.
- [03:41] It did that beautifully. It did that
- [03:43] really fast. Here are the five elements
- [03:45] that Vzero helped me incorporate into
- [03:48] the design that ended up helping drive
- [03:51] conversions. The first is a tiered
- [03:53] pricing psychology. By offering three
- [03:56] options, $29, $99, and
- [04:00] $149, we created what psychologists call
- [04:03] the compromise effect. And by that, I
- [04:05] mean most people will pick the middle
- [04:07] option, which is exactly what we want,
- [04:09] the $99 purchase price. And there's also
- [04:13] urgency and scarcity that need to be
- [04:15] built into the app. We need to drive
- [04:17] people to FOMO into clicking purchase.
- [04:20] And the way we did that is by creating
- [04:21] this scarcity. Only 14 documents
- [04:24] remaining at this price. Fear of missing
- [04:26] out is a very powerful driver in this
- [04:28] case. And then also with any of these AI
- [04:31] apps, we need to build trust. And the
- [04:33] best way to do that is to let people try
- [04:35] before they buy. A document preview
- [04:37] feature was a gamecher for conversions.
- [04:40] Here we let customers potentially see a
- [04:42] watermarked version of the doc before
- [04:45] they buy it. And that increased
- [04:46] conversions by 76% right there by just
- [04:50] putting that at the bottom of the page.
- [04:51] And then all sorts of trust elements
- [04:53] help as well. A money back guarantee
- [04:55] badge, testimonials with real photos,
- [04:58] comparison tables, all of this is just
- [05:01] design and marketing. And Vzero and
- [05:03] Claude did great with this together. And
- [05:05] then of course expanded form fields.
- [05:07] Adding form fields for your specific
- [05:09] state. any special clauses you want to
- [05:11] add to your document, you can just put
- [05:13] that right into the document in the form
- [05:15] and it'll generate that for you. So
- [05:17] Claude helped me design this landing
- [05:20] page and then BZero helped me create
- [05:22] that full front end with all the bells
- [05:24] and whistles. It took me like 2 or 3
- [05:26] hours in total to do this. The full app
- [05:29] requires a backend. It requires Stripe
- [05:32] for payments integration and VZO is not
- [05:35] the best for that. The best for that is
- [05:37] Cursor. And Cursor is what I've been
- [05:39] using as my back-end full stack app
- [05:41] generator. Normally, it would take me
- [05:43] weeks to build this app. I mean, it took
- [05:45] me weeks to build my AI sports betting
- [05:47] bot, Wager GPT, which people love. And
- [05:49] if you want to check it out, make sure
- [05:51] to check out Wager GPT. Now, I can build
- [05:53] apps in days, if not hours, with Cursor.
- [05:56] And that's incredible. Just through
- [05:58] prompting alone, I don't even type. In
- [06:00] fact, I whisper. I use a tool called
- [06:02] Whisper Flow to convert my voice to
- [06:04] text. I'm whispering all these giant
- [06:06] prompts into Cursor and it's just
- [06:08] building them on autopilot while I'm
- [06:10] hands-free. It's incredible. And here's
- [06:12] the exact prompt that I gave Cursor to
- [06:14] fully build the AI. I said, "Build a
- [06:16] fully functional AI legal document
- [06:18] generator web app based on the provided
- [06:21] HTML landing page. Include document
- [06:24] generation with GPT4. I use chat GPT,
- [06:27] payment processing with Stripe, email
- [06:29] notifications, and all necessary
- [06:31] back-end systems. And that's enough to
- [06:33] have this agent build the full stack web
- [06:36] app. Not only does it generate code, it
- [06:39] runs commands. It creates files. Oh my
- [06:41] god. Okay, it's happening. It creates
- [06:43] directory structures. It checks its
- [06:45] work. It sees what's wrong. This built
- [06:48] the app in a single prompt. And then I
- [06:50] just iterated a few times saying, "This
- [06:53] is good, but can you please improve the
- [06:55] landing page to make it more beautiful
- [06:57] and make sure the Stripe page is a
- [06:59] dedicated checkout? And here's my Stripe
- [07:02] API keys as well as my OpenAI API keys.
- [07:05] And that's where you give it your Stripe
- [07:07] API keys right in the prompt interface.
- [07:09] It will then put input that into the ENV
- [07:12] file for safekeeping. And then you can
- [07:14] deploy that app. I deployed it using
- [07:16] Heroku, which is just one of many
- [07:18] sources. You could use Verscell. There's
- [07:20] so many out there. With a few clicks, it
- [07:22] deployed it to Heroku for me. And you
- [07:24] could see the full code for this app.
- [07:26] I'm open sourcing all this code on
- [07:28] GitHub so you can build your own version
- [07:30] of this AI legal document generator.
- [07:33] That's pretty good. It's pretty simple.
- [07:35] We just go in, we say whatever our forms
- [07:38] are, we input a simple name and idea and
- [07:42] a corporation and we wait a bit and it's
- [07:45] going to generate the legal document for
- [07:47] us. And this was using
- [07:49] GPT40. I had some generation issues with
- [07:52] GPT 4.5 preview because it took too long
- [07:55] to generate. Heroku's timeout was 30
- [07:57] seconds. I just used a less intelligent
- [08:00] but faster model. And now that we've
- [08:02] built this app, I've showed you how I
- [08:03] built it with Cursor, with BZero, and
- [08:06] with Claude, let's talk about how to
- [08:08] sell this thing. Because building an app
- [08:10] now is super easy. Everything is
- [08:12] distribution these days. And that's why
- [08:14] we have influencers. That's why we have
- [08:16] personal brands. The reason I didn't use
- [08:18] my personal brand to sell this is
- [08:20] because I wanted to see if I could sell
- [08:22] this without that boost. I used Chat GPT
- [08:25] to build my marketing strategy. Chad GPT
- [08:28] was my chief marketing officer here. And
- [08:30] I told it, I gave it the full context
- [08:32] of, "Hey, Claude, help me build this.
- [08:34] I've got 24 hours to make some profit.
- [08:36] Please help me make $2,000 in the next
- [08:39] 24 hours." And it decided that Google
- [08:42] Ads was the best avenue to make that
- [08:44] money for this specific app. And the
- [08:47] reason is because there's so many people
- [08:49] searching Google for legal documents.
- [08:51] And so my Google ad strategy focused on
- [08:54] five high converting keywords with
- [08:56] proven buyer intent. First one is
- [08:59] download NDA template with a $3.20 CPC
- [09:02] with 2400 monthly searches. The second
- [09:05] one is terms of service generator at
- [09:08] $2.75 of cost per click and 3,100
- [09:11] monthly searches. And the third is was
- [09:13] privacy policy template at $2.90 cost
- [09:17] per click with 4,200 monthly searches.
- [09:21] So for the campaign structure, I created
- [09:23] three separate ad groups and each was
- [09:25] targeting a different document type. We
- [09:28] had NDAs, terms of service, and then
- [09:30] privacy policies. And this allowed me to
- [09:33] AB test between different ad copies.
- [09:35] Chad GPT decided all of this. It wrote
- [09:38] all the ad copies. It told me what would
- [09:41] likely convert best, what to put as a
- [09:43] description for all these things, and it
- [09:45] was just instrumental in creating all of
- [09:47] these high converting ad variations that
- [09:49] helped me identify the best keywords to
- [09:51] target. I spent quite a bit here on
- [09:54] Google Ads, but I learned a lot about
- [09:56] the demographics. I learned a lot about
- [09:59] who my customers are, where they live.
- [10:01] California was a huge demographic, Texas
- [10:03] and New York. Searches, you could see
- [10:05] the top ones were AI for law firms right
- [10:07] here. My click-through rate was three
- [10:10] times the industry average. It was at
- [10:12] 11% a few hours ago. Now it's at 9%. But
- [10:16] still, that's a huge amount. And it
- [10:18] shows that I had 158 clicks. It shows
- [10:22] how much people want something like this
- [10:24] and how much people are searching for.
- [10:26] Chat GPT was right. Google ads was the
- [10:29] best avenue for this. Mobile was the
- [10:31] highest performing. 90% of searches came
- [10:34] through mobile. So that gave me some
- [10:35] signal. Okay, I need to optimize this
- [10:37] thing for mobile. The next step is
- [10:39] optimizing all of these conversions. How
- [10:41] did I optimize the conversions here?
- [10:43] Well, I ran several AB tests. And at
- [10:45] first, I just had a $99 price tier
- [10:48] because that I thought was like simple
- [10:50] enough to just deploy. But nobody was
- [10:52] buying that. I got 100 plus clicks and
- [10:55] not a single conversion. So, that was
- [10:57] bad. So, by adding pricing tiers, that
- [10:59] definitely helped. It increased the
- [11:00] result by 31.4% in revenue per visitor,
- [11:03] which was great. And then the document
- [11:05] preview had a huge impact as well. That
- [11:07] was a
- [11:09] 76.2% improvement in the conversion
- [11:11] rate. And then adding a live chat
- [11:13] performance helped by a lot as well
- [11:15] where you just give people that trust,
- [11:17] you know, like this isn't just some scam
- [11:19] tool. It's actually generating your
- [11:21] legal document. You can see it right
- [11:23] here, the result. I found some really
- [11:25] surprising findings like state specific
- [11:27] targeting resulted in 42% higher
- [11:30] conversion. That was pretty surprising
- [11:32] to me. And then mobile users were the
- [11:34] biggest ones. I thought desktop because
- [11:36] legal docs and PDFs are very much a
- [11:38] desktop thing. Evening hours had the
- [11:40] highest conversion rates between 6:00
- [11:41] and 10 p.m. The money back guarantee
- [11:44] badge increased trust scores. That
- [11:46] surprised me. And then the sample
- [11:47] document section doubled time on page.
- [11:50] So that was really helpful. And using
- [11:52] Google Analytics on the page helped with
- [11:54] that. Chad GBT suggested I add that and
- [11:56] then I went back to cursor and just told
- [11:58] it to add that snippet and it did it for
- [12:00] me. So essentially I'm just going back
- [12:02] and forth between my AI team here. I'm
- [12:05] giving the full context to Claude and
- [12:07] then to Vzero and then to Cursor and
- [12:09] then back to Chat GPT and then back to
- [12:12] Cursor and then back to Claude with the
- [12:14] progress. And so you can see that I
- [12:16] built this team of AIS for me. Now that
- [12:19] these AIs are sufficiently intelligent,
- [12:22] they are able to make money in these
- [12:23] domains. They're able to develop
- [12:25] successfully. They're able to market
- [12:27] successfully. They're able to scale
- [12:29] successfully. So, let's talk about that.
- [12:31] Scaling is our next strategy based on
- [12:33] the first 24 hours of data. Here's
- [12:36] exactly how we're going to scale this
- [12:38] business to $10,000 per month in revenue
- [12:41] within the next month. So, there's four
- [12:43] pillars here of scaling. The first is
- [12:45] traffic expansion. We know what works
- [12:47] and what doesn't work with Google ads
- [12:49] already, but we need to increase the
- [12:51] marketing streams that we're going to
- [12:53] use. We need to increase the
- [12:54] distribution channels. And I've already
- [12:56] created a Tik Tok channel for this. and
- [12:58] I just recorded four Tik Toks right off
- [13:00] the bat. Chad GPT helped me design the
- [13:03] full scripts for these. Unfortunately,
- [13:05] they didn't get that many views. So,
- [13:06] Chad GPT had a great idea to just start
- [13:09] with Google ads. It just goes to show
- [13:10] that you can do many different types of
- [13:14] marketing strategies with these AIs. You
- [13:16] just have to prompt them properly. And
- [13:18] then document expansion helped. I also
- [13:20] think that having a recurring revenue
- [13:21] model is going to help us with expansion
- [13:23] as well. Just having a free trial is
- [13:25] huge to get people to dish out their
- [13:27] debit or credit card. And then just
- [13:29] complete AI automation. I want to have
- [13:31] AI powered email support. I want to have
- [13:33] automated document updates based on
- [13:36] regulation changes, self-optimizing ad
- [13:39] campaigns. Make this much more agentic.
- [13:41] Don't have me prompting Claude and Chad
- [13:43] GPT. They should be prompting each
- [13:45] other. And that could be using their
- [13:47] APIs to be sending responses back and
- [13:49] forth. And then those should be
- [13:50] connecting to these tools. And so having
- [13:52] an affiliate program with automatic
- [13:54] payouts, that would also help this scale
- [13:57] by a lot. And I already use this for
- [13:58] Wager GPT, my AI sports betting bot. I'm
- [14:02] really excited about the potential here.
- [14:04] Like it has never been easier to build
- [14:06] and deploy and market an AI business.
- [14:09] This should be inspiring to you. I am
- [14:11] here to help you out. I think that
- [14:13] everybody can and should be an AI
- [14:16] entrepreneur. I want to see a billion
- [14:18] billionaires. And I know that sounds
- [14:20] wild at first, but AI truly will create
- [14:23] a world of abundance. And it will create
- [14:25] a world without scarcity, but it's not
- [14:28] going to be through universal basic
- [14:30] income. It's going to be through
- [14:31] everyone making money online with AIs,
- [14:34] their own AIs. Just take your idea, talk
- [14:37] to Cursor, talk to Claude, talk to Chad
- [14:39] GPT. Ask them, "Make me a plan to make
- [14:42] money. Here's what I'm interested in.
- [14:44] Here's what I could actually spend time
- [14:46] on." Give yourself a deadline. That's
- [14:48] always super important to get yourself
- [14:50] to actually get done. That's how I
- [14:53] got myself to build all this. I gave
- [14:54] myself a 24-hour deadline. I'm really
- [14:57] excited about the potential here. I'm a
- [14:59] new parent as well. Huge shout out to my
- [15:02] wife and kid for helping me out with
- [15:03] this. Because of these tools, it's
- [15:05] possible. I can compress all that time,
- [15:07] hundreds of hours into hundreds of
- [15:10] minutes with these AI tools. And there
- [15:12] are four key lessons that I want to
- [15:14] conclude this video with for you. The
- [15:16] first is that AI plus no code tools
- [15:19] equals speed. The combination of Chad
- [15:21] GPT, Claw 3.7 Sonnet, Whisper Flow, and
- [15:25] V0 dramatically increased how fast I
- [15:28] could launch this. And the second is
- [15:29] validation before building. Testing
- [15:31] demand with minimal viable products
- [15:33] saved me from wasting time on features
- [15:35] nobody wants. And the third is that
- [15:37] trust elements are critical. We got to
- [15:39] add these extra reassurances like money
- [15:42] back guarantees, refund policies to get
- [15:44] customers to buy these products. And the
- [15:46] last is that tiered pricing psychology
- [15:49] works even though it requires more
- [15:52] effort upfront. Adding a tiered pricing
- [15:54] structure is going to increase
- [15:56] conversions. So remember, I'm open-
- [15:58] sourcing the entire codebase for this
- [16:01] project. You'll find the link in the
