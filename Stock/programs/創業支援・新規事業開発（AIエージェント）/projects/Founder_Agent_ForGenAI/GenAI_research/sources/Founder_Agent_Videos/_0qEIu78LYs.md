- [00:00] It's the first day with the new laptop.
- [00:01] So, my deepest apologies to everyone.
- [00:04] Um, to let you know a little bit about
- [00:06] who I am. My name is Allison Cosette. I
- [00:10] am here with Neo4j representing our
- [00:14] workshop today. So, let me see. Here we
- [00:17] go. Ah, here we go. All right. So,
- [00:19] hopefully everybody can see everything
- [00:20] now. Um I am here with uh Neo4j and I am
- [00:26] going to be walking you through how we
- [00:29] get uh structured data and unstructured
- [00:32] data into a graph rag system so that you
- [00:36] can um run your agents. So what I have
- [00:40] available for everyone, the good news is
- [00:42] and what what's pretty exciting about
- [00:44] Graph Academy is at Neoforj that we have
- [00:47] a ton of free courses that are available
- [00:50] and free workshops. This workshop that
- [00:53] I'm walking you through today is usually
- [00:55] two hours. So I'm going to give you the
- [00:57] compressed version, but the the good
- [00:59] news is that this workshop will be
- [01:02] available to you at any time. So, um, if
- [01:05] you want to go to the URL and run this
- [01:08] yourself, it's going to be
- [01:10] graphacademy.neforj.comcourses
- [01:14] and the name of the course is
- [01:16] workshop-genai.
- [01:19] Um, can everybody see my screen? Okay,
- [01:21] Raja, hopefully you can. Um, and what
- [01:24] we're going to be
- [01:25] >> on this thing.
- [01:26] >> Excellent. All right. So, um, again, so
- [01:28] all of this is available and it's free
- [01:30] to you. We're kind of giving you a
- [01:32] little bit of the compressed version
- [01:33] today, but what I'm going to do is I'm
- [01:35] going to walk you through all of these
- [01:36] pieces. So, um, to tell you a little bit
- [01:40] about what we're talking about, many
- [01:42] people have, and I'm actually just going
- [01:45] to, you know, you certainly don't need
- [01:48] me to go over the the basics of what is
- [01:51] Genai. Obviously, everybody here is
- [01:53] perfectly familiar with that. But what I
- [01:56] do want to talk through is I want to
- [01:57] talk through a little bit around um the
- [02:01] uh the the model. So we clearly know
- [02:05] that when we're working on rag
- [02:07] applications and we're working on agent
- [02:08] applications, we're really trying to in
- [02:11] our case use how we can use data to
- [02:14] improve what's coming out of the
- [02:16] language model. The way that we do this
- [02:19] in our instance is what I'm introducing
- [02:21] you to today is a knowledge graph. So
- [02:23] the knowledge graph is actually built
- [02:25] based on nodes and relationships. So
- [02:28] when we think of how rag works and what
- [02:30] we're grounding in, what we're going to
- [02:31] be grounding in today is not just
- [02:35] everybody's pretty used to a vector
- [02:36] database, what we're going to do is
- [02:38] we're going to expand that concept of
- [02:40] the unstructured and vector database and
- [02:42] expand it to include your structured
- [02:44] data. So some of the basics about graph
- [02:47] are we have nodes and relationships. So
- [02:50] you can think of it like um if you've
- [02:52] got a table of people and a table of
- [02:55] comp in our case we're working with SEC
- [02:57] data today. So we have a table of asset
- [03:00] managers and we have a table of
- [03:01] companies right so these asset managers
- [03:03] own shares in these companies. In a
- [03:06] traditional relational database you
- [03:09] would have probably a lookup table that
- [03:12] would have the name of the asset manager
- [03:13] the name of the company and then some
- [03:15] parameters. So they own a certain amount
- [03:18] of stock at a certain point in time. And
- [03:21] so in general, the way that you can
- [03:23] think of the relationship, the not to
- [03:25] use a relationship, but the connection
- [03:27] between relational and graph is if
- [03:29] you've got a lookup table in your erd in
- [03:32] a graph, that would roughly be what we
- [03:34] call a relationship. So those elements
- [03:37] that are on um that table would then be
- [03:40] properties on the relationship, which is
- [03:42] what we have here. So just to give you a
- [03:44] little bit about that, I know
- [03:46] everybody's looking forward to learning
- [03:48] another language, but the language that
- [03:50] we use to query the database in graph is
- [03:54] called cipher. The good news is uh we
- [03:58] have a very clear consistent um uh
- [04:03] format around that language. Much of it
- [04:05] is very similar to what you'll see in
- [04:07] SQL, right? So you you have a return
- [04:11] statement select from where but rather
- [04:13] than that what we have is we have match
- [04:15] and return. So what we're looking for is
- [04:17] we're looking for patterns in the
- [04:20] relationship. So if historically in SQL
- [04:23] you would say from asset manager join
- [04:28] lookup table join company and you would
- [04:31] have this very complex piece. In our
- [04:32] case we're saying just match me the
- [04:34] asset manager who owns companies. In
- [04:37] this case, we're saying the asset
- [04:38] manager is Andre, the asset manager that
- [04:41] owns the company, and then return
- [04:43] whatever those properties are. So, just
- [04:46] a little bit of a heads up that we're
- [04:47] we're going to be using cipher.
- [04:51] When we do retrieval augmented
- [04:53] generation in our case, what we're
- [04:56] looking at is using the knowledge graph
- [04:58] as that external grounding piece, which
- [05:01] is what we're looking at here. So how do
- [05:04] we actually go about building the graph?
- [05:06] So there's a number of different ways
- [05:08] that we go through it. Um and we we'll
- [05:11] walk you through a little bit of it here
- [05:12] and then I'm going to show you some
- [05:14] things in the the notebook itself. So
- [05:17] obviously we know the the challenge with
- [05:19] traditional rag is that we're you when
- [05:22] we're using a vector store we're really
- [05:25] returning based just on similarity but
- [05:27] not necessarily on understanding or
- [05:30] business logic. I always like to use the
- [05:32] analogy of a vector database is kind of
- [05:35] as if you took, let's just say I'm
- [05:38] onboarding a new employee and I have an
- [05:40] employee manual.
- [05:42] If I took that manual and chunked it up
- [05:45] and tore it into little pieces and put
- [05:46] them on index cards, each of those
- [05:48] little pieces has information. But if I
- [05:51] say, "Show me the index cards that are
- [05:53] similar to, I don't know, a time off
- [05:56] policy. Maybe there's an additional
- [05:58] piece of metadata that's represent
- [05:59] that's connected to it that it may not
- [06:01] be. But what we really need to be able
- [06:04] to do is we need to be able to take the
- [06:08] information but connect it to other
- [06:10] things, which is what we're really doing
- [06:12] in this particular instance, right? And
- [06:14] so that's what we're going to be working
- [06:16] on today is how can we expand that
- [06:19] vector database to add in additional
- [06:23] structured data to that unstructured
- [06:25] data. So in our example that we use in
- [06:28] this workshop is we have um PDF
- [06:30] documents and these are about companies
- [06:33] and finances and different risks
- [06:35] associated in that unstructured data.
- [06:38] And what we're going to be doing is
- [06:39] we're going to be using AI to extract
- [06:42] those entities and relationships
- [06:45] ultimately setting up for how we put it
- [06:47] into an agentic solution. Now, the idea
- [06:51] is, and at the end, we're going to show
- [06:52] you just a simple agent, but what we
- [06:55] really want to focus on today, and I
- [06:57] want everybody to get out of this, is
- [06:59] you've got lots and lots of
- [07:01] conversations in this um yesterday and
- [07:04] today around how we're building agents.
- [07:06] And what I want you to have from this is
- [07:09] how do we put together the optimal data
- [07:11] to get the best possible output from our
- [07:14] agents, which is mostly what we're going
- [07:16] to be focusing on today.
- [07:18] So in this case, what we're looking to
- [07:21] do is we're looking to connect our
- [07:23] unstructured and our structured data. So
- [07:26] for example, we're familiar with this
- [07:28] process here on the left. We have the
- [07:30] document and we create we create a chunk
- [07:32] from it. This is your traditional vector
- [07:34] moment. But what we also want to do is
- [07:36] we want to be able to have access to the
- [07:38] structured data. In our case, we have
- [07:41] some structured data around which
- [07:43] company is connected with that document.
- [07:46] And the first thing that we're going to
- [07:47] do is everything you see in red is going
- [07:50] to be structure that's extracted from
- [07:52] the unstructured data. So within these
- [07:55] SEC filings, they talk about products.
- [07:58] They talk about stock types or
- [07:59] transactions or risk factors. This light
- [08:03] blue element you see is actually coming
- [08:05] from in our case, you know, it's a it's
- [08:07] a workshop. It's a toy example, a CSV
- [08:09] that outlines which asset managers own
- [08:12] these individual companies. And so what
- [08:14] you have in the end is what we build out
- [08:17] is we build out this combination of your
- [08:20] unstructured data in this vector moment.
- [08:23] We have structure extracted from the
- [08:25] unstructure and we have whatever your
- [08:28] traditional data would be as far as that
- [08:30] structure is concerned. So this is what
- [08:32] we're working up to today.
- [08:35] What is the data that we're going to be
- [08:37] working with and what's used here? What
- [08:39] we have is we're using Edgar SEC
- [08:41] filings. As we can see here, the
- [08:44] original challenge might be how do we
- [08:46] extract this structured insight from
- [08:47] thousands of pages of text. In our case,
- [08:50] you know, we're talking about these
- [08:52] quarterly filings that get filed with
- [08:54] the SEC and that's what we're going to
- [08:56] be working with. And what we do is we
- [08:58] take those documents and they're chunked
- [09:00] and the the vectors are created. So just
- [09:02] as we can see here what we're going to
- [09:05] do is we're going to match the document
- [09:07] um in this system when you look if when
- [09:10] you run the um when you run this in
- [09:13] graph academy this data is already
- [09:16] loaded for you so that you can play with
- [09:18] it and clearly what we're seeing here is
- [09:20] we've got this particular PDF was
- [09:22] chunked into 99 chunks 72 chunks
- [09:26] everybody knows there's an art to the
- [09:28] chunk but really what we want to show
- [09:30] you is right Now, when we looked at that
- [09:34] that diagram of the document and the
- [09:36] chunk, what we're looking at is give me
- [09:38] back this path. So, show me the document
- [09:41] where those chunks are coming from. What
- [09:43] that looks like is I can actually let's
- [09:46] say match. I'm going to d document. Um,
- [09:49] I'm going to create this. I'm going to
- [09:53] look at the again this new laptop. Um,
- [09:57] I'm going to look at the uh from
- [10:01] document, right? And then I'm going to
- [10:05] connect that document to a chunk. Okay.
- [10:09] All right. And then what I'm going to do
- [10:11] is I'm going to return let's just return
- [10:14] star and we're going to limit to let's
- [10:17] say 10 just so we can get a look at what
- [10:19] this looks like. And the reason I'm
- [10:21] running it this way is what I want you
- [10:23] to see is I want you to see the actual
- [10:25] graph. So in this case we've got this
- [10:27] one particular document. We see that
- [10:30] this document these chunks this
- [10:32] particular chunk is from this document.
- [10:35] And the other thing that we see is we
- [10:37] see next chunk. So again this is another
- [10:40] way that we can maybe you're building an
- [10:43] agent where you want to bring back that
- [10:45] vector chunk but you want some context.
- [10:48] So you want maybe the chunk before and
- [10:49] after.
- [10:51] In these cases, by having them set this
- [10:53] way, it allows you to bring in that
- [10:56] immediate bit, but also see how
- [10:58] everything is set up within the graph
- [11:01] itself.
- [11:02] Um, what we've done, and I and I'll show
- [11:06] you the uh I'll walk you through what's
- [11:08] in the in in the code as far as how
- [11:10] we're extracting this in just a minute,
- [11:12] but what we've done is we've then done
- [11:14] the schemadriven extraction. So what
- [11:16] we've done is in the the graph rag
- [11:19] notebook we've said okay I want to look
- [11:21] at the companies I want to extract
- [11:24] entities such as executive product
- [11:27] financial metric like we had seen on
- [11:29] that earlier layout then I want to also
- [11:33] create these metrics here and what this
- [11:35] ends up looking like uh we've got our
- [11:38] code spaces up here um when we are in
- [11:41] the document you're going to see the um
- [11:45] our financial documents. What you'll see
- [11:47] is the PDF build. So in the PDF build,
- [11:50] this is actually going to show you
- [11:53] um you're gonna we're this is actually
- [11:55] the notebook that walks you through how
- [11:57] we actually did that. So clearly we set
- [12:00] up yourv file. One thing to note when
- [12:04] you're um using Graph Academy in this
- [12:07] particular workshop, one of the things
- [12:10] that you're going to see, hold on one
- [12:12] second.
- [12:14] Close this. Um when you go to set up
- [12:17] your Oh, why is this not working? What
- [12:20] is my retriever? Uh oh.
- [12:23] What is happening?
- [12:25] Uh oh. Why is this not
- [12:29] Uh oh.
- [12:31] All right. Well, I'm not sure exactly
- [12:33] why this isn't loading for me right now.
- [12:36] Hopefully, you guys can still um Raja,
- [12:38] can you still see the what we're showing
- [12:41] right now?
- [12:48] Hopefully.
- [12:52] All right. I'm not really hearing
- [12:54] anything, so I'm assuming that
- [12:55] everything is okay. Um, as I mentioned,
- [12:57] one of the challenges that we're having
- [12:59] right now, I don't know why this is not
- [13:03] running to my next piece.
- [13:08] All right. We've got our vectors. What
- [13:09] is a retriever?
- [13:12] Set up your development environment.
- [13:16] All right. Well, it looks like now this
- [13:17] is actually running, which is good. Um
- [13:20] uh in this particular course when you go
- [13:21] to setting up your development
- [13:23] environment one of the things that
- [13:24] you're going to see is you can open in
- [13:26] GitHub code spaces. So all of the
- [13:28] documents associated with this will
- [13:30] load. But the other thing that you'll
- [13:32] see is you'll see the connection
- [13:34] information. So you will have to bring
- [13:36] your own open API key to run this. But
- [13:39] what we see clearly is that we've got
- [13:41] the information. So this database, this
- [13:44] instance is going to get set up for you
- [13:46] right away and then it will be connected
- [13:49] um it'll be connected separately. So let
- [13:51] me move this out of the way. All righty.
- [13:54] All right. Hopefully we can still see
- [13:57] everything. So just to understand what's
- [13:59] happening inside the instance itself.
- [14:02] So, how we actually did this PDF loader
- [14:06] is we went through and we want you
- [14:08] you're going to set up your ENV. This
- [14:11] information here is coming directly from
- [14:13] Graph Academy. We're going to give this
- [14:15] to you here. You can drop those in. Um,
- [14:18] you can also set it up with av file as
- [14:21] you see fit. And what we've done is
- [14:23] we've gone through and the first thing
- [14:24] we did is we created these documents in
- [14:26] chunks, right? We create these documents
- [14:28] in chunks. And how do we actually do
- [14:30] that? which is what we're looking at
- [14:32] here. Um, in my case, as we know, when
- [14:36] we're trying to set up data that's
- [14:38] helpful to our application, we always
- [14:41] want to be mindful of the messiness of
- [14:43] the data. I come from a longtime data
- [14:46] science background. I think I spent the
- [14:47] first five to seven years of my data
- [14:50] science career mostly cleaning up data.
- [14:53] Um, and that's one of the interesting
- [14:54] things to know about the new AI engineer
- [14:57] moment is you really are you're not just
- [15:01] an SWE anymore. You're not just an
- [15:03] engineer anymore. You really do have
- [15:06] those data science and those data
- [15:08] management skills. So what you'll see in
- [15:10] this particular instance is we actually
- [15:13] provide some additional information
- [15:15] about how we want the names of the um
- [15:18] companies to be extracted. So the first
- [15:20] thing that we do is we initialize the
- [15:22] LLM. Um this is still set up with GPT40
- [15:26] rather than five. You can certainly
- [15:28] adjust it to the model of your choice.
- [15:31] But what we've asked it to do is we've
- [15:33] asked it to go into the unstructured
- [15:34] data and say find the we have the
- [15:37] company that's associated with that
- [15:39] document and go in and extract all of
- [15:41] these different elements.
- [15:43] Now I'm showing you one very particular
- [15:46] structured way to go about it. We do
- [15:48] have MCP servers available to help you
- [15:51] do this. There's lots of ways to to
- [15:54] approach this, but in this case, what
- [15:56] we're showing is we're showing you a
- [15:58] very structured format. The reason I
- [16:00] like the structured format is when we
- [16:03] are in a non-deterministic space, any
- [16:05] opportunity we have to get really clear
- [16:09] and to bring some structure, I'm always
- [16:11] going to opt for that. So, one of the
- [16:14] things that we set up, the way we set it
- [16:16] up is we set up this Python dictionary
- [16:18] where we say, okay, I'm looking for the
- [16:20] label, the node label. That's the type
- [16:22] of the node I'm looking for, which is an
- [16:24] executive or a product or a financial
- [16:26] metric. In this case, when I'm looking
- [16:29] at the actual properties, I'm just
- [16:31] looking at um sorry, I'm just looking at
- [16:34] the the name and inputting that as a
- [16:37] string. You can if you're looking for
- [16:40] dates, you can set those in to return as
- [16:42] date times. This is where you really
- [16:44] want to get very clear about what is it
- [16:47] in this unstructured data that's going
- [16:49] to be useful to me and how do I want
- [16:52] that information to be put into Neo4j so
- [16:55] I can access it. The next thing that we
- [16:58] see is we see the relationships. So in
- [17:00] this case we're saying I want to look at
- [17:04] the relationships has metric faces risk
- [17:07] etc. And this is what we have here. Say
- [17:10] risk factor company. The relationship
- [17:12] between them is called faces risk.
- [17:16] As I mentioned, I put in an additional
- [17:18] prompt template because I wanted to be
- [17:19] very clear that I need the company names
- [17:22] that are extracted to match what's in my
- [17:25] structured data. And this is something
- [17:28] where you always want to be thinking
- [17:31] when you're looking to take that
- [17:33] unstructured data and make it available
- [17:35] in a graph rag application. You always
- [17:38] want to be thinking of what do I have in
- [17:40] my structured data stores that can be
- [17:44] found in this unstructured data and how
- [17:46] do I make sure that that jump match is
- [17:49] going to tie. Uh in Neoforj we have
- [17:53] plenty of algorithms around entity
- [17:55] resolution and different pieces like
- [17:57] that but in this case I just wanted to
- [17:59] show you a way that we bring in this
- [18:01] prompt to run that.
- [18:04] So the next thing that we do and this is
- [18:06] really the key here that I want to
- [18:09] really highlight is we're using the
- [18:11] Neo4j graph package and we're using
- [18:14] something called simple KG pipeline and
- [18:17] in this instance what we've done is we
- [18:19] take the driver which is connecting to
- [18:21] our instance we have the LLM that we set
- [18:24] as always you want to make sure that
- [18:26] what your embedding model is is how is
- [18:29] going to tie to how you're querying
- [18:32] but what we see here is then we passing
- [18:34] that those dictionaries of the entities
- [18:36] and the relationships. I also passed in
- [18:38] the prompt template and then there's
- [18:40] something called enforce schema equals
- [18:42] strict and that means if you don't sort
- [18:46] of rein in the LLM it's going to find
- [18:48] all different kinds of entities all
- [18:50] different kinds of relationships and in
- [18:52] this case you want to really tie in and
- [18:54] get really clear and clean on what that
- [18:57] is. So when you run this, we ran this
- [18:59] over the over the data set and what
- [19:03] we've do is we run this pipeline. We ran
- [19:05] it on all these PDFs. Um and then at the
- [19:09] end we create this vector index. And
- [19:12] where you see this is you see this as I
- [19:14] mentioned in our in our building of the
- [19:19] graph. Let me take you back to here.
- [19:23] This is everything that was done in this
- [19:25] element. And this is what got us to this
- [19:27] moment here. This is what got us to the
- [19:30] ability to say we have all of these
- [19:32] chunks. So what we then want to do is we
- [19:35] want to say okay well you ran all of
- [19:37] this data here when you've extracted
- [19:39] these elements. How can I take a look at
- [19:41] those? So here's one way that we can
- [19:43] look at it. So once we ran this we came
- [19:46] out with 820 risk factors, 470 financial
- [19:50] metrics and this is showing us all of
- [19:52] those entities that were extracted. the
- [19:55] a little piece about how we dropped in
- [19:59] our um structured data. So in addition
- [20:03] what you'll see in our second notebook
- [20:06] and I can share this with you one moment
- [20:10] in the second notebook nope this yeah
- [20:13] the second notebook here the loading the
- [20:16] structured data we show you a visual
- [20:19] there isn't actually any code in this
- [20:21] particular notebook it's really just the
- [20:23] walkthrough of when you have your own
- [20:26] data and you want to load it in how
- [20:28] could you go about that so it takes to
- [20:31] it encourages you to go to
- [20:33] console.neforj.io.
- [20:36] One thing to know about Neo4j is we do
- [20:39] have a free tier instance. We also have
- [20:43] a community edition where if you want to
- [20:45] lo something locally, we have a strong
- [20:48] open-source soul at Neo4j and our
- [20:50] origin. So, we really want to make it
- [20:52] accessible to you. So when you go to
- [20:54] console the or the Neo4j aura console
- [20:57] which is our instances we have a really
- [20:59] clear walkthrough of how you actually
- [21:01] will load in that data. One of the
- [21:04] things to note is um we've got these
- [21:07] different asset managers and the
- [21:08] companies and we show you how to
- [21:11] actually map out um you know and it's
- [21:15] very very detailed in case you want to
- [21:17] see what these look like. We have all
- [21:19] the walkthroughs of how do you add in a
- [21:21] node? How do you add in a label? We do
- [21:24] have a lot of um uh sorry, we do have
- [21:29] many connectors as you see here. We've
- [21:32] got lots of ways that you can connect to
- [21:34] your data. Um and the key is
- [21:37] you ultimately want to be able to tie
- [21:39] your unstructured and your structured
- [21:40] data together. So there is a walkthrough
- [21:43] in here in the financial documents PDF
- [21:45] build about how you actually get to that
- [21:48] moment.
- [21:50] So the data that's in there and what we
- [21:53] walk through in that notebook is what we
- [21:56] see here. We have the name of the
- [21:57] manager, the company name, the ticker of
- [21:59] what they own and what those values and
- [22:01] those shares are. So as we mentioned,
- [22:04] we've got this walkthrough of how you
- [22:06] can do say a guey load. We have many
- [22:09] other ways that you can do it as well
- [22:10] and we talk you through that there. Um,
- [22:14] the interesting thing for me is once we
- [22:17] actually get all of that loaded in, we
- [22:20] now see that we've got what was
- [22:21] extracted from the unstructured data,
- [22:24] right? Those risk factors, financial
- [22:26] metrics, we have the chunks where those
- [22:28] PDFs were were um added in. And then the
- [22:32] other thing now is we've got this asset
- [22:34] manager. Now in our case we only have 15
- [22:37] asset managers. We only have a few a
- [22:39] handful of companies. I think we have
- [22:41] eight or 10 companies um range of
- [22:44] documents. But one of the things that we
- [22:46] note is that now you can actually take a
- [22:50] look at a whole company. So what does
- [22:52] that look like? So to to dive in a
- [22:55] little bit to this the cipher query. So
- [22:58] here we're saying we've loaded these
- [22:59] documents from Apple. Um, and what we
- [23:02] want to say is we want to show we add
- [23:06] what we call optional match. And
- [23:07] optional match just means if it's there,
- [23:09] show it to me. But if it's not there,
- [23:11] don't break the query. So bring me back
- [23:14] Apple.
- [23:15] Show me if there are asset managers that
- [23:18] own them. Show me if there are chunks.
- [23:20] And then here, what we're doing is we're
- [23:22] just doing the aggregation, right? So
- [23:25] give me the counts on these. And what we
- [23:26] see is for Apple, we have 175 extracted
- [23:30] entities. So those are the products
- [23:32] executives um risk factors that we had
- [23:34] discussed. We see that of our asset
- [23:37] managers 15 different asset managers own
- [23:41] a portion of Apple and we have
- [23:43] approximately 44 text chunks that are
- [23:45] associated with Apple as well. And you
- [23:48] may be saying you know how how might
- [23:51] this be of interest to me? And what I
- [23:53] can show you is let's actually also look
- [23:56] at let's just do instead of doing this
- [24:00] I'm actually just going to do a return
- [24:02] star. I'm going to limit it to 25.
- [24:07] And I want to show you a little bit
- [24:08] about what this ends up looking like in
- [24:11] the graph. So in this graph what we're
- [24:14] seeing here is we've got Apple, we've
- [24:17] got all of these different entities that
- [24:20] were extracted or a risk factor. So in
- [24:22] this case it faces a risk of um this is
- [24:26] probably uh adverse macroeconomic
- [24:29] conditions. We can see that um it faces
- [24:33] a risk of political uncertainty
- [24:36] you know so we have all these different
- [24:37] types of risk that it might be facing.
- [24:39] The other thing is we're also seeing an
- [24:41] example of an asset manager that owns
- [24:44] Apple, right? And then this we're seeing
- [24:47] like an example of one particular chunk
- [24:50] and we also note that this particular
- [24:53] risk that it's faced which is geographic
- [24:56] some piece is was found in that chunk.
- [24:59] So under the hood each of these entities
- [25:02] that we've extracted is tied to that
- [25:04] chunk. That chunk is tied to the
- [25:05] company. The company is tied to the
- [25:07] asset manager. And you may be asking
- [25:10] yourself, why do we need all of these
- [25:12] connections? How does this actually help
- [25:14] my agent?
- [25:16] It's going to help your agent in a
- [25:18] variety of ways. One of the things I'll
- [25:20] I'll I'll talk you through is let's
- [25:22] actually go to the retrievers. So, when
- [25:26] we talk about retrievers, we're talking
- [25:28] about h the ways that we can query the
- [25:31] database and use that information as
- [25:34] context. So whether you're using it as
- [25:37] context for your agent for a memory
- [25:39] moment, whether you're using it as
- [25:41] context for a like an actual, you know,
- [25:44] NLP verbal response or written um, you
- [25:49] know, return, there's lots of different
- [25:51] ways that you're going to be using this
- [25:52] data in your agents. But what I'm going
- [25:54] to walk you through is I'm going to walk
- [25:56] you through a couple of ways that we do
- [25:57] this. So everybody's familiar, I
- [26:00] imagine, with your vector retrievers and
- [26:02] your vector search in Neo4j. The way
- [26:05] that this is stored is in the um so let
- [26:09] me actually do this. Let me do I'm going
- [26:12] to show you the chunk. We're going to
- [26:14] match the chunk and we're going to
- [26:17] return C limit one because I want to
- [26:20] show you what it actually looks like in
- [26:22] the um
- [26:25] here we go. So then we have a node here
- [26:27] that's the chunk. But what's actually in
- [26:29] that element? So one of the things we
- [26:31] see is we've got this chunk. The chunk
- [26:33] has an ID. We've got our our embedding
- [26:36] which we're used to that vector. We have
- [26:38] the text associated with it. And these
- [26:41] are these are the important pieces. So
- [26:43] when we think about doing a vector
- [26:45] search, what we're doing here is you
- [26:48] still have that vector search and vector
- [26:50] index like you do in a vector DB, but
- [26:52] now it's a part of the actual node. and
- [26:55] this element that we saw before where we
- [26:58] have this chunk. Now we can say from
- [27:01] this particular chunk let me say let's
- [27:04] say I do um a search on and I do some
- [27:07] sort of a vector search on on a query.
- [27:10] Now what I'm able to do is I'm able to
- [27:12] from that particular chunk go to the
- [27:15] company or go to the asset manager that
- [27:18] owns the company or go to an extraction.
- [27:22] So when we do this initial vector
- [27:24] retriever, all that we're doing is a
- [27:26] basic vector search. So if I say what
- [27:29] are the risks that Apple faces, I create
- [27:31] this vector retriever. Um here what I'm
- [27:34] doing is I'm passing it the driver. So
- [27:36] clearly we want to connect to the
- [27:38] database. Um the vector index that we
- [27:40] created was called chunk embeddings
- [27:43] using the same embedder that we used to
- [27:45] embed within the model and I want to
- [27:47] actually return just the text from that.
- [27:50] So this is what that retriever is built
- [27:52] to bring back. So then when you run this
- [27:55] um oh I don't have them run here but
- [27:58] you'll be able to run these uh directly
- [28:00] yourselves because everything's loaded
- [28:01] in already. What you're going to get is
- [28:03] you're going to get those results and in
- [28:05] that case you're going to have um like a
- [28:07] a very clear table of what's returned
- [28:10] within the graph rag package. You can
- [28:12] actually turn it back into natural
- [28:14] language. And we can do that by doing
- [28:16] graph rag which says okay give me the
- [28:18] LLM run those vector retrievers and then
- [28:21] give me those answers. Right?
- [28:24] Where things get more interesting is
- [28:26] when we're talking about the contextual
- [28:28] cipher retriever. And this is where
- [28:31] graph rag is really going to sing
- [28:33] because what we want to be able to do is
- [28:36] we want oh sorry we want to be able to
- [28:39] go and traverse the graph itself. So,
- [28:42] what does that actually end up looking
- [28:44] like? So, we can take you to our
- [28:47] retrievers. Let's go to working with
- [28:49] retrievers.
- [28:51] And um this is where you can you can
- [28:53] actually run the retrievers yourself and
- [28:55] you can run them in here. So, for
- [28:57] example, um I'm creating a vector
- [29:00] retriever. I am going to embed that and
- [29:03] then I want to get a response back. Um
- [29:07] the the interesting thing like I said
- [29:10] about the graph rag is that you're not
- [29:14] just looking at the um you're not just
- [29:18] looking at the vector. You're looking at
- [29:19] the vector as it ties to the other
- [29:23] elements of the graph itself. Right? So
- [29:26] if we look at how we actually built the
- [29:28] graph,
- [29:30] let's just say I want to um let me do it
- [29:34] this way.
- [29:38] So let's just say in our case we are
- [29:42] looking at this contextual piece right
- [29:45] so I want to sorry go to our advanced
- [29:49] drag I want to be able to traverse the
- [29:52] graph so let's just say I know that my
- [29:56] agent is often going to be used to is
- [30:00] has a tool and I want that tool to be
- [30:02] able to give me back risk factors for a
- [30:05] particular particular company. There are
- [30:06] a number of ways you can do that. You
- [30:08] can certainly do it by a vector search
- [30:12] on the risk factors. But the challenge
- [30:14] with that is if I do a vector search,
- [30:17] one of the experiments we did with this
- [30:18] data is we said give me all of the risk
- [30:22] factors faced by Apple.
- [30:25] Now the vector for Apple risk,
- [30:29] remember it's semantic. It's not
- [30:31] structured. So it could go into those
- [30:33] chunks and oftentimes it would probably
- [30:35] give you apple. But what we noticed is
- [30:38] when we increased the K because usually
- [30:40] in your retrievers you're you're
- [30:42] returning a certain number of chunks or
- [30:43] a certain number of vectors. As we
- [30:45] increased the K, one of the things we
- [30:47] found is it started returning vectors
- [30:50] from Microsoft documents because maybe
- [30:53] Apple was mentioned or something similar
- [30:56] to Apple or similar to iPhone or
- [30:59] something that was semantically similar
- [31:00] was coming in. And so what we know to be
- [31:04] true is that sometimes
- [31:07] the vector itself isn't going to give us
- [31:11] what the structured element that we're
- [31:14] looking for because in this case I want
- [31:17] to know what are the risk factors that
- [31:20] Apple faces is my query right what are
- [31:23] the top risk factors that Apple faces um
- [31:25] you can see in my comments here it's
- [31:27] like detailed search with context or why
- [31:29] this is a bad query the reason this is a
- [31:32] bad query is because as as I said as we
- [31:35] increase the K as we increase the number
- [31:38] of elements we're returning we end up
- [31:40] not getting apple at all and so what we
- [31:43] need to do is we need to refine how
- [31:46] we're looking at it now in our case we
- [31:49] happen to have extracted all those risk
- [31:51] factors when we ran it initially we
- [31:53] didn't we tried running it and we said
- [31:55] oh let's go in and extract the risk
- [31:57] factors when we build the graph so now
- [32:00] if I want the risk factor from Apple, it
- [32:03] becomes a straight match query. So match
- [32:06] company where name is Apple and return
- [32:10] all of the has risk. So it's really just
- [32:14] this element here company has risk risk
- [32:17] factor that then gets returned and it's
- [32:19] really straightforward and it's lovely.
- [32:22] But there are times when we want to have
- [32:26] a different element, a different type of
- [32:28] traversal.
- [32:29] So
- [32:31] this is one of my favorite examples
- [32:33] especially in this data set where we
- [32:37] look at what is actually being returned
- [32:40] and why do we need graph. You know
- [32:42] sometimes people will say to me well
- [32:44] Allison if you're just running vector
- [32:45] search I can use a vector store. And I'm
- [32:47] like yeah if all you want is just the
- [32:49] vectors you can absolutely use a vector
- [32:51] store. And then somebody else
- [32:53] says,"Well, if I'm really just looking
- [32:55] for something really structured, say
- [32:56] those Apple has risk or asset manager
- [33:00] owns, um, I can just use SQL for that."
- [33:02] I'm like, you're absolutely right. You
- [33:04] can create a SQL tool, you can create a
- [33:06] vector tool, but the question becomes,
- [33:10] what happens when we need to traverse
- [33:12] across the two, right? What do we what
- [33:16] happens when we get to that moment? So
- [33:18] in this particular case, a prime example
- [33:21] of this is this query here. Which asset
- [33:24] managers are most affected by
- [33:26] cryptocurrency policies?
- [33:29] I can definitely look up cryptocurrency
- [33:32] risk as a vector search, right? I could
- [33:36] absolutely go into those chunks and do a
- [33:39] vector search and bring back
- [33:40] cryptocurrency, right? No problem. I can
- [33:44] absolutely find out which companies own
- [33:48] or owned by particular asset managers,
- [33:50] right? Like anything on this side, we
- [33:53] could do a SQL query. Anything on this
- [33:55] bit here, we could definitely do a
- [33:57] vector. But the question was which asset
- [34:01] managers are most affected by a
- [34:04] cryptocurrency issue? And in this case,
- [34:07] what we're the way that it works is we
- [34:09] say, okay, I have a query that's based
- [34:12] in unstructured data and is based in the
- [34:15] vector. Right? So what I want to do is I
- [34:18] want to go through the vector search and
- [34:20] give me all the chunks or the K chunks
- [34:23] that are related to this topic
- [34:24] semantically similar. Then what I want
- [34:27] to do is I want to find out which
- [34:29] document it's from, which company
- [34:32] published that document and then which
- [34:34] asset managers own that company. And
- [34:37] this is where building out specific
- [34:40] tools can be really helpful. Could you
- [34:43] have something that's really dynamic
- [34:45] where you say, "Okay, here's the schema.
- [34:48] Be super dynamic. Create the query based
- [34:50] on what someone's asking." Absolutely.
- [34:53] You could do it completely dynamically,
- [34:56] but if you know that this is a a a
- [35:00] structure that's going to come up a lot
- [35:03] or something that's going to be pretty
- [35:05] impactful if I'm building this agent to
- [35:09] give me information about investing in
- [35:12] asset managers based on what we've seen
- [35:15] in these unstructured pieces, then this
- [35:18] is a moment where I might want to create
- [35:20] a tool.
- [35:22] The way that we do that is with this
- [35:24] retriever right here. And this is the
- [35:26] piece. So if we look right here in chunk
- [35:28] to asset manager query. One of the
- [35:31] things you notice in the cipher
- [35:33] statement is it starts with node and
- [35:37] that means
- [35:39] first it's running the vector search and
- [35:42] then it's finding those chunks and then
- [35:43] it says okay based on those chunks with
- [35:46] node now
- [35:49] make this traversal. And in this case,
- [35:52] we're saying go from the chunk to the
- [35:55] document to the company to the asset
- [35:58] manager. Return to me the name of the
- [36:01] company, the asset manager name, um you
- [36:05] know, so asset manager in shares. And
- [36:08] you could you could also if you wanted
- [36:10] to also return say uh the like what is
- [36:14] the value of what's owned, you could
- [36:15] create you could pull that property out
- [36:17] as well if you wanted to do a certain
- [36:18] kind of ranking.
- [36:20] But the key here is how can we leverage
- [36:24] these type of retrievers to build out a
- [36:27] set of tools that's going to be helpful
- [36:30] for our agent.
- [36:32] the likelihood
- [36:34] that you have an answer or a moment or a
- [36:39] context that is a combination of some
- [36:42] sort of structured data and unstructured
- [36:45] data is I've had a really hard time
- [36:48] coming up with scenarios where that's
- [36:50] not the case. Um, I jokingly said to
- [36:53] someone the other day, if you're working
- [36:55] on these systems and you're not using
- [36:58] graph, you're probably building in some
- [37:02] sort of technical debt. And this is why
- [37:06] there's a lot of talking. You'll see,
- [37:08] you know, other people from the company
- [37:10] talking about these elements. We start
- [37:12] talking about how do we manage memory?
- [37:14] How do we manage context? Um there's a
- [37:16] really great course that Andreas Koliger
- [37:19] ABK from Neoforj just released uh with
- [37:22] Andrew Ang on deep learning.ai and it's
- [37:25] all about the the agent. Um we have some
- [37:27] other folks that are working on some
- [37:29] really interesting memory pieces. So you
- [37:30] can definitely check out that content.
- [37:32] But the reality is that the in order for
- [37:37] the agent to act effectively
- [37:41] and to create the appropriate pathways
- [37:44] and outcomes, the context or memory is
- [37:50] key.
- [37:51] The context is not flat. The context has
- [37:55] some sort of relation in it. you you
- [37:58] know some of my areas of interest really
- [38:00] become about tracking the agent pathways
- [38:04] right you see different types of
- [38:05] observability tools you see we look out
- [38:08] for tool looping and things like that
- [38:11] the graph is really important clearly
- [38:15] we're showing how it's important as a
- [38:17] tool and as a retriever but it's really
- [38:19] important as a structure around what
- [38:21] you're building as well so to get back
- [38:24] to what we're talking about structured
- [38:25] and unstructured in graph graph rag.
- [38:28] This really is the moment where I
- [38:31] believe that the graph sings the most as
- [38:34] a retriever and as a tool. Um we
- [38:37] definitely have one other thing to note
- [38:39] is we do have the vector cipher
- [38:41] retriever example and in this case all
- [38:44] that we do is we say we can actually uh
- [38:48] pass different well this is the same
- [38:49] piece here um vector cipher retriever
- [38:52] examples. Um yeah, this is another
- [38:55] another example of a of something where
- [39:00] it was what might another tool be. In
- [39:03] this particular tool, what we're looking
- [39:04] for is we're looking for based on that
- [39:07] node. So based on um like in this query,
- [39:10] I think we're looking at what are some
- [39:12] shared risk factors. So if I wanted to
- [39:16] know what are the risk factors shared by
- [39:20] people who by companies who uh are
- [39:23] impacted by a lithium shortage. So it
- [39:25] would go to the lithium shortage or
- [39:26] whatever my query might be and then it
- [39:29] would go to that company and then it
- [39:31] does another interesting traversal. It
- [39:33] says go to that company find all the
- [39:36] risks that it faces and then show me all
- [39:39] the other companies that face that same
- [39:41] risk. Right? So this might be a tool
- [39:44] where you're trying to look for, you
- [39:46] know, clusters of companies or maybe a
- [39:50] cascading impact or understanding if one
- [39:54] thing happens and this company is
- [39:57] affected, what are some of those other
- [39:58] pieces. So we've got an example of what
- [40:00] that return looks like as far as the
- [40:03] actual graphic. And in this cases what
- [40:05] we're seeing is we've we see these are
- [40:06] the different companies and this is
- [40:09] where these are the risks that they
- [40:11] co-share right it's always really
- [40:15] interesting to consider
- [40:18] what is the optimal answer and what
- [40:22] information do we need for that agent to
- [40:25] make a decision for that final output
- [40:28] after that agentic traversal really in
- [40:32] any given moment
- [40:34] If you have had a moment where you said,
- [40:36] "Oh, I wish my agent knew X or I wish I
- [40:41] could pass this along." Imagine if you
- [40:45] were able to pass not just the context
- [40:48] in a you know you know maybe a like a a
- [40:53] written context but imagine what's
- [40:56] possible if you were able to pass this
- [41:00] graph of interconnections as context to
- [41:04] your agent.
- [41:06] Maybe it's this information and you know
- [41:10] the previous few tools. There's any
- [41:12] number of ways that you can evolve
- [41:16] what's in this graphic form and you pass
- [41:19] it through as a JSON, right? You can
- [41:21] pass you can pass this like very clearly
- [41:23] through as a JSON. As we noticed when we
- [41:26] were looking um Oh, wait. No, it's not
- [41:28] there. When we look at what those
- [41:30] outputs are when we run the queries, you
- [41:32] know, you can you can have them come
- [41:34] through in in really consumable ways.
- [41:37] But this is what I really want you to be
- [41:38] thinking about. what is it that we can
- [41:41] pass through that then becomes helpful.
- [41:44] So in this particular workshop what we
- [41:47] what we do is we then go through so we
- [41:49] showed you a few of these different
- [41:50] retrievers. Um this is a great retriever
- [41:53] too where we take the schema. So you
- [41:58] actually get the schema from what you've
- [41:59] built in the database. We pass that
- [42:02] schema into text to cipher and then from
- [42:05] here we can say okay what are the
- [42:07] company names of companies owned by
- [42:09] black rockck and then we'll actually
- [42:10] create the cipher query for you. So then
- [42:13] you can go ahead and actually execute
- [42:15] it. Sometimes folks will use this inside
- [42:18] of um building out a node or any number
- [42:21] of different ways that you can you can
- [42:23] create the text to cipher. But in the
- [42:26] workshop and what we show you is we show
- [42:28] you a few different notebooks. The first
- [42:29] one starts with a basic lang chain agent
- [42:33] and um you know it it creates this
- [42:36] reasoning and acting agent right and the
- [42:39] first thing that we do is again you
- [42:41] connect it to your instance but really
- [42:43] what we're looking to do is we create
- [42:44] this first tool which is get the graph
- [42:46] database schema right so in our case
- [42:49] we're saying the context is equal graphs
- [42:51] schema and the graph really is in our
- [42:54] case you you'll notice that we're using
- [42:56] um pieces that are already built into
- [42:57] lang chain and langraph
- [42:59] in this particular element. So we've got
- [43:02] the create react agent and what we're
- [43:05] doing is we're we're saying okay get get
- [43:08] me the schema of the graph and that
- [43:10] becomes the first tool and then you can
- [43:12] say say summarize the schema of the
- [43:14] graph and then it's going to give that
- [43:17] back to you. Then what we do in notebook
- [43:20] number two is we take that first tool
- [43:21] that we built but now we're going to
- [43:23] expand it and add in a new tool. So in
- [43:25] this case, we're saying let's add in
- [43:27] this retrieval query tool where we want
- [43:29] to get the name of the company from that
- [43:33] from that vector. I mean it could be any
- [43:35] of the retrievalss that we shared
- [43:37] earlier where there's a traversal of
- [43:39] some kind. But really what we want to
- [43:41] show is we want to show you how do you
- [43:44] start to build out these tools in this
- [43:46] lang chain langraph um scenario. So in
- [43:50] this case we've got it really
- [43:51] straightforward. We've got this match
- [43:53] element match the node and we're showing
- [43:55] the traversal. This can get more complex
- [43:58] like we saw in those other retrievers.
- [44:00] And now what we're going to do is we're
- [44:01] going to say okay return thi return this
- [44:04] way order by descending. And so this is
- [44:06] what's going to be coming back from the
- [44:08] retrieval query. Um you know we've got
- [44:11] the vectors. So now what we're going to
- [44:13] do is we're going to create a new tool
- [44:15] called retrieve financial documents. And
- [44:17] in this tool what we're saying is we're
- [44:19] going to chunk the vector. We're going
- [44:20] to do the similarity search, right? The
- [44:22] K is three. And now we're adding we're
- [44:25] adding this piece. So give me back those
- [44:27] those vectors. Give me back those
- [44:29] chunks. So this is going to be pretty
- [44:31] straightforward here. And we're
- [44:33] returning the context. So now we've
- [44:35] started out with getting the model. And
- [44:37] now we can also get add in this these
- [44:39] new tools to our tool list. Right? So we
- [44:42] had get schema and now we can actually
- [44:44] retrieve the documents from the chunk.
- [44:46] And then in the final one, we're looking
- [44:48] at the text to cipher, which we talked a
- [44:51] little bit about already. And the new
- [44:53] tool that we're adding here is we're
- [44:55] saying, okay, generate a cipher template
- [44:58] to query the graph database only use the
- [45:00] provided relationship types. We're
- [45:02] giving it like some pretty clear
- [45:04] direction because one of the things that
- [45:06] we know is that we've we are we've
- [45:09] already built out how we pull in that
- [45:10] schema and now we're adding in the
- [45:12] schema into whatever this cipher
- [45:15] template is. So now we've got the cipher
- [45:17] prompt. We're passing it the schema and
- [45:20] the question and then we're setting
- [45:22] we're setting the template and now we've
- [45:24] actually created this new graph cipher
- [45:28] QA chain and we're adding in these
- [45:30] elements. Um a thing to note here uh
- [45:33] Martin who I adore who's one of my
- [45:35] co-workers put this piece in and he's
- [45:37] like yes just be aware you are trusting
- [45:39] the generation of cipher to an LLM. It
- [45:42] may generate invalid cipher queries. So
- [45:44] please be mindful as we have all learned
- [45:46] from public discourse, you know, you do
- [45:49] not want to give your LLM generated
- [45:52] queries free reign over your production
- [45:54] code. So just a friendly reminder as
- [45:56] always. But ultimately what we get to is
- [45:59] we now have this agent built out where
- [46:01] it has the get schema tool, the retrieve
- [46:04] documents tool, and the querying of the
- [46:06] database tool. So when you run this
- [46:09] application, you'll be able to leverage
- [46:11] all of these tools. The really the key
- [46:14] to all of this for us is that what we
- [46:17] want you to understand is the likely as
- [46:21] I mentioned the likelihood that what is
- [46:23] best for your agent is some sort of
- [46:27] connection and relation is very very
- [46:30] high.
- [46:32] Our goal and my goal in this talk today
- [46:35] is to get you to see what's possible,
- [46:38] how we produce and connect structured
- [46:40] and unstructured data and then how we
- [46:43] then make that available as an example
- [46:45] tool within the set itself.
- [46:49] As I mentioned this particular workshop
- [46:51] and the details where you can reproduce
- [46:54] it on your own is available at graph
- [46:56] academy. A thing to know when you go to
- [46:59] graph academy is that this particular
- [47:01] workshop is not it's publicly available
- [47:04] if you have the URL but you will not see
- [47:08] it listed. So if you want to go through
- [47:10] this what I would say is if you have
- [47:12] questions feel free to reach out to me
- [47:14] on LinkedIn. I am highly available and
- [47:17] try to be as responsive within a day or
- [47:19] two as I can be. But
- [47:21] graphacademy.comcoursesworkshop-genai.
- [47:25] I don't know if somebody can drop that
- [47:27] in the chat, but just know this is here
- [47:29] and it's available to you. I am
- [47:32] available um like I said via LinkedIn.
- [47:35] If you need anything, feel free to join
- [47:37] the community.j.com.
- [47:40] Uh we have a discord channel that is
- [47:42] also very active and I really encourage
- [47:46] you take a look at Andreas's course with
- [47:48] Andrew Ang at deep learning and dive
- [47:51] into how you can improve your agents not
- [47:55] just with structured and unstructured
- [47:57] data but what is possible when we add
- [48:00] this connected context to the variety of
- [48:02] elements along your tool set. Again
- [48:06] thank you all so much. I really
- [48:08] appreciate you. I appreciate your
- [48:09] understanding of my lack of a of a of a
- [48:13] face for you today, but please reach out
- [48:15] with any questions you have any time.
- [48:18] Raja, thank you so much for having me
- [48:20] and I wish everybody good luck on the
- [48:22] rest of your journeys throughout the
- [48:24] course today and the talks today and
- [48:26] your agentic moments moving forward.
- [48:29] >> Okay. Uh thank you so much Allison. Um
- [48:33] it was great having you. Um, do you want
- [48:35] to So, we have a few some questions in
- [48:38] the chat. Uh, do you want to handle that
- [48:40] or uh
- [48:41] >> Yeah, sure. Let me take a quick peek.
- [48:43] Um, okay. There's the forum.
- [48:46] Okay.
- [48:47] >> And also, I mean, so someone pointed out
- [48:50] maybe since it's a new laptop sometimes
- [48:52] they have those sliders on your uh your
- [48:55] camera maybe.
- [48:55] >> You know, I tried the slider and then it
- [48:58] ended up looking like where is it? Uh,
- [49:00] let me turn my video back on. when the
- [49:02] slide I tried the slider and this is
- [49:05] what happens when the slider is open.
- [49:07] So, for some reason I'm still not here
- [49:10] then.
- [49:10] >> Yeah. Um Oh, thank you so much for
- [49:13] putting in the the source to the
- [49:15] workshop. I really appreciate that. Um
- [49:18] where are my Q&A? Oh, so many Q&A. Let's
- [49:21] see.
- [49:23] >> And I can help you filter them as well.
- [49:25] I mean, maybe you can take a look and
- [49:26] maybe I can also uh
- [49:28] >> Okay, so I'm going to start at the
- [49:29] bottom and move my way back up. So, how
- [49:31] is the risk factor determined by domain
- [49:33] knowledge expert or is this automated?
- [49:35] The way that it works with when you use
- [49:37] the graph rag package is that you when I
- [49:40] set up that Python dictionary of the
- [49:42] entities I'm looking for, that's the
- [49:44] information I'm giving the LLM to go in
- [49:47] and find those entities in the
- [49:48] extraction. So the risk factors are
- [49:51] determined by the LLM who's gone in
- [49:54] which has gone into the documents to
- [49:56] find what it deems risk factors and
- [49:59] create those entities from there. Um do
- [50:02] you get a certificate for the graph
- [50:03] academy courses? You do get completion
- [50:05] certificates for graph academy. We also
- [50:08] have you can get uh certifications. We
- [50:11] have two certifications. one as a graph
- [50:14] uh you have a Neo4j certification then
- [50:17] there's also a Neo4j data science and
- [50:19] analytics certification so know about
- [50:21] that so if you don't have enough
- [50:23] confidence in the LLM generated queries
- [50:25] to run in a production environment
- [50:27] doesn't that nullify the whole point of
- [50:28] LLM as a tool I'm not saying that
- [50:30] they're not that we don't have
- [50:32] confidence but just as a general caveat
- [50:34] we just always like to say you know I I
- [50:38] don't want to be liable for you know uh
- [50:41] an LLM query But honestly most of the
- [50:44] time they are they are very good. Um but
- [50:47] you know it's more about don't have the
- [50:49] LLM you know delete tables things that
- [50:52] we know already. Um from YouTube graph
- [50:55] vector one use cases to make our search
- [50:58] efficient. Yes. So the vector is very
- [51:00] helpful in making it efficient. You are
- [51:03] using cosine similarity to get as close
- [51:05] to that semantic origin as possible. So
- [51:08] it definitely will increase the
- [51:10] efficiency in getting to that moment for
- [51:12] sure.
- [51:14] Um
- [51:16] yeah let's see using graph rag I use
- [51:19] only neo forj during retrieval or do I
- [51:21] need a vector data store? No you do not
- [51:23] need a vector data store. The vector is
- [51:26] that embedding and that vector is one of
- [51:28] the properties on the chunk node. So you
- [51:30] do not need a separate uh vector data
- [51:33] store. And uh let's see the same could
- [51:37] be direct. Yep. talked a little bit
- [51:38] about how some of it is in you could go
- [51:41] traditional or live. Um yes, there real
- [51:45] yes there are real life implementations
- [51:47] of MCP. I would say go to Neo4j look up
- [51:50] our MCP protocols. Michael Hunger um
- [51:54] who's our head of innovation is our VP
- [51:56] of innovation has done some really
- [51:58] incredible work with our team there. Um
- [52:00] study materials for agentic AI with
- [52:02] examples there. I don't know if the
- [52:05] Graph Academy Agentic courses are out. I
- [52:08] would say if you're looking for agents
- [52:10] right now, I would go to that deep
- [52:12] learning course. Um, I would I would do
- [52:15] that. That's the most recent release
- [52:17] that we have is with deep learning AI.
- [52:22] Yes, not all companies share the same
- [52:23] risk. Some are common. There is a slight
- [52:25] distinction.
- [52:27] Does a full course renei explain basics
- [52:29] like what is rag? Yes, Mustafa.
- [52:32] Excellent question.
