- [00:00] Hello everyone and welcome to Crossover
- [00:02] Mind. Today we're diving into one of the
- [00:05] biggest shakeups in the entertainment
- [00:06] industry, the massive new partnership
- [00:08] between the Walt Disney Company and
- [00:10] OpenAI. I'm your host, Steve, and as a
- [00:13] media and tech business analyst, I'll be
- [00:15] guiding us through the strategy behind
- [00:16] this deal. And I'm Lisa. I don't know
- [00:18] much about the business side of things,
- [00:20] but I've seen the headlines about AI
- [00:22] making movies. And honestly, I have a
- [00:24] lot of questions. I'll be asking the
- [00:26] things we're all wondering about from a
- [00:27] beginner's perspective. So, Steve, I saw
- [00:30] that Disney is investing $1 billion in
- [00:32] OpenAI. Does this mean ChatGpt is going
- [00:35] to be writing the next Avengers movie?
- [00:37] >> Not exactly, Lisa, though that is the
- [00:39] first place people's minds go. This deal
- [00:42] is actually much more specific and
- [00:43] strategic than just screenwriting. The
- [00:45] headline feature is that Disney is
- [00:47] becoming the first major partner for
- [00:49] Sora, OpenAI's video generation
- [00:51] platform.
- [00:52] >> Sora is the one that makes realistic
- [00:54] videos from just text. Right.
- [00:55] >> That's the one. Under this agreement,
- [00:57] they are opening up a sandbox. Fans will
- [01:00] be able to use Sora and Chat GPT images
- [01:02] to create their own short videos using
- [01:04] over 200 beloved characters from Disney,
- [01:07] Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars. And here's
- [01:10] the kicker. A curated selection of these
- [01:12] fan-made videos will actually be
- [01:13] available to stream on Disney Plus.
- [01:16] >> Wait, let me get this straight. I could
- [01:17] type in Mickey Mouse surfing on Mars,
- [01:20] generate a video, and if it's good
- [01:21] enough, it ends up on Disney Plus
- [01:23] alongside the actual movies.
- [01:25] Theoretically, yes. And that brings us
- [01:27] to the first major strategic pillar,
- [01:29] user generated content, or UGC.
- [01:32] >> Why does Disney want fan-made videos on
- [01:34] their platform? They spend billions
- [01:36] making perfect movies. Why dilute that
- [01:38] with stuff I make on my laptop?
- [01:40] >> That is a great question. Think about
- [01:42] where people spend their time today.
- [01:43] They're on Tik Tok, YouTube, and
- [01:45] Instagram. They aren't just watching.
- [01:47] They are engaging, remixing, and
- [01:49] creating. Disney realized that to keep
- [01:51] the attention of younger generations,
- [01:53] they cannot just be a library of old
- [01:55] movies. They need to be an interactive
- [01:57] platform. By bringing AI tools to the
- [01:59] fans, they are trying to capture that
- [02:01] engagement energy within their own
- [02:03] ecosystem rather than letting it all
- [02:05] happen on social media.
- [02:06] >> I see. So, instead of me scrolling Tik
- [02:08] Tok for funny Disney clips, they want me
- [02:10] doing that inside the Disney Plus app.
- [02:12] >> Exactly. And this connects to the most
- [02:14] critical point from their recent
- [02:16] financial reports. Bob Iger, Disney CEO,
- [02:18] is positioning Disney Plus not just as a
- [02:20] streaming service, but as a portal to
- [02:23] the entire Disney universe.
- [02:24] >> A portal? What does that mean in this
- [02:26] context?
- [02:27] >> Think of Disney Plus as the front door
- [02:29] to everything Disney offers. In the
- [02:31] past, you watched a movie on Netflix,
- [02:32] bought a toy at Target, and booked a
- [02:34] park ticket on a travel site. Disney
- [02:36] wants to consolidate that. They want a
- [02:38] unified app experience. By using
- [02:40] OpenAI's technology, they can create a
- [02:43] highly personalized system where the
- [02:44] content you watch links directly to
- [02:46] merchandise, gaming, and even park
- [02:48] experiences.
- [02:49] >> So AI helps connect the dots.
- [02:51] >> Precisely. Imagine finishing a Star Wars
- [02:53] show and the AI immediately suggests a
- [02:55] relevant game, offers you a custom
- [02:57] discount on a lightsaber, or lets you
- [02:59] generate your own Jedi character scene.
- [03:01] It transforms the app from a passive TV
- [03:03] screen into an active lifestyle hub.
- [03:05] >> That makes sense for engagement, but you
- [03:07] mentioned they are investing a billion
- [03:08] dollars. Is there a cost-saving aspect
- [03:10] to this too or is it just about cool new
- [03:12] features?
- [03:13] >> There is definitely a massive efficiency
- [03:15] play here. In the business world, we
- [03:16] look at cost performance optimization.
- [03:19] Disney produces an incredible amount of
- [03:21] content, and that is expensive. While
- [03:23] they aren't replacing human creativity,
- [03:25] using AI for background processes,
- [03:27] visual effects prototyping, and
- [03:28] administrative workflows can save
- [03:30] millions.
- [03:30] >> So, it's about doing the boring stuff
- [03:32] faster so they can spend money on the
- [03:34] creative stuff. That is the goal, but
- [03:36] it's also about the unified app strategy
- [03:38] I mentioned. Merging Hulu, Disney Plus,
- [03:40] and ESPN content into one seamless
- [03:42] experience requires incredibly complex
- [03:45] back-end technology to recommend the
- [03:46] right content to the right person. Open
- [03:48] AI's models are excellent at processing
- [03:50] that kind of data to keep you glued to
- [03:52] the screen.
- [03:52] >> I have to ask about the safety part. If
- [03:54] fans can generate Disney videos, what
- [03:56] stops someone from making Mickey Mouse
- [03:58] say inappropriate things? That seems
- [04:00] like a PR nightmare waiting to happen.
- [04:02] That is the biggest risk and it's why
- [04:04] this partnership is so focused on
- [04:06] responsible AI. The press release
- [04:09] heavily emphasizes safety standards. The
- [04:11] agreement excludes any talent likenesses
- [04:13] or voices, so you can't deep fake Robert
- [04:16] Downey Jr. into your video. They are
- [04:18] building human- centered AI with strict
- [04:20] guardrails to prevent harmful content.
- [04:22] >> Okay, that's a relief. So summarizing
- [04:25] what you've told me, Disney is
- [04:27] partnering with Open AI not just to make
- [04:29] movies, but to turn Disney Plus into a
- [04:32] super app where we watch, play, create,
- [04:34] and buy things. And they are using AI to
- [04:37] make the fans part of the creative
- [04:39] process while saving money on the back
- [04:40] end.
- [04:41] >> You nailed it, Lisa. It represents a
- [04:43] shift from Disney being a broadcaster to
- [04:46] Disney being a techdriven interactive
- [04:48] platform. It's a bold move to
- [04:50] futureproof the company against tech
- [04:52] giants. It sounds exciting, but also a
- [04:54] little overwhelming. I guess we'll see
- [04:56] what the fans create when these tools
- [04:58] launch in 2026.
- [04:59] >> Indeed, we will. Thank you for joining
- [05:02] us again on Crossover Mind. We hope this
- [05:03] helped clarify things. Don't forget to

- [05:07] time.
