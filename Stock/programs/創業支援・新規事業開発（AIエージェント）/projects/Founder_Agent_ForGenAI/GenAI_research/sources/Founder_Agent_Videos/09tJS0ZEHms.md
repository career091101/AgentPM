- [00:00] So let's check the position now. So if
- [00:01] you open up this, you can see we are
- [00:03] 12.7%
- [00:04] up on the Solana short 20x leverage uh
- [00:08] position we we made here. So maybe 40x
- [00:12] is a bit too much. Let's do a 20x uh
- [00:15] instead. So you can see here place order
- [00:18] bitcoin is true uh is by true leverage
- [00:21] 20 size. Okay, here we are $2 up. So I
- [00:24] want to close this 2.9% up. Perfect.
- [00:28] Okay, so lately there's been a lot of
- [00:29] talk about using these LLMs to make uh
- [00:32] trading in crypto. And you can see this
- [00:35] post, Quen makes 51% profit compared to
- [00:37] other models. So if you try to zoom in a
- [00:40] bit here, you can see it started out
- [00:42] with $10,000 and it ended up with
- [00:45] 15,000. So it made a 50%
- [00:48] uh gain here on trading for about a
- [00:52] week, I think, or something. So that was
- [00:55] pretty impressive. So today uh I made an
- [00:57] account on hyperlquid. So let me go
- [01:00] there. So this is the same platform that
- [01:02] they used in the experiment I think and
- [01:05] they have an API. So that is what we
- [01:07] going to use. Uh I have already created
- [01:09] this. So I wanted to do this by if you
- [01:12] go here we go to cloud. Uh I wanted to
- [01:14] try to use MCP servers for this. So we
- [01:17] can be inside our claw agent here when
- [01:20] we actually do the trading. I thought
- [01:21] that could be pretty fun. So I created a
- [01:23] hyperlquid MCP and if you look at the
- [01:26] tools we have here we have an get
- [01:28] account info we can get market data open
- [01:31] positions we have we can place an order
- [01:34] close a position and set leverage and
- [01:37] some other stuff uh we just created here
- [01:39] but the most important ones are kind of
- [01:42] finding the positions placing the orders
- [01:44] and we can do uh get account info right
- [01:48] something like that and this should
- [01:50] trigger the hyperlquid MCP just to see
- [01:52] how much money we have in our account at
- [01:55] this moment in time. So, you can see
- [01:58] here we grab the account information. We
- [02:00] have 93.97,
- [02:03] right? And you can see we have one
- [02:05] position open as I showed you in the
- [02:07] intro. And yeah, you can kind of see
- [02:09] that. So, let's do that. So, let's get
- [02:11] position
- [02:13] positions. So, we can get the open
- [02:15] positions we have. You kind of
- [02:17] understand how the MCP works. We can do
- [02:18] everything here from our terminal and
- [02:22] with the MCP tools. I think this is
- [02:23] pretty cool and we can do some Yeah,
- [02:26] terminal trading here. Yeah, you can see
- [02:28] the position we have here. This is a
- [02:30] short in Solana and we are $1 up. So
- [02:33] today I just wanted to show you kind of
- [02:35] how I a simple setup how we did this and
- [02:38] kind of how it works and how we can
- [02:39] place trades, how we can monitor trades
- [02:41] and yeah, just a fun project I had uh
- [02:44] this morning. So uh I don't think I have
- [02:46] a time in this video to kind of go
- [02:47] through every single detail in the MCP
- [02:49] server. But I want to do one example uh
- [02:52] how this works now. So you can see uh
- [02:55] here on the cursor under servers we have
- [02:58] the hyperlquid MCP server that is local.
- [03:01] This is not something that we connect to
- [03:03] on the web. Everything is running
- [03:05] locally here. Right? So we have the
- [03:07] hyperlquid server. We have the index.py
- [03:10] and under the list of tools here we have
- [03:12] a tool called place order. Right. And
- [03:15] here is the actual function we are
- [03:17] using. So this is the place order
- [03:19] function. This is the function that is
- [03:22] executing the request from the
- [03:25] hyperlquid server here on the tool place
- [03:28] order. Right. So I'm not going to go
- [03:31] much more into detail but uh what I want
- [03:34] to mention is if you want to build your
- [03:35] own MCP servers, Hyperlid has a pretty
- [03:38] good documentation.
- [03:40] So you can see as context here uh when I
- [03:43] built this I collected 4,000 lines of uh
- [03:46] documentation for the hyperlquid
- [03:49] platform. So that is basically all I
- [03:51] needed to build my MCP server. Now let
- [03:54] me show you uh a couple of ways we can
- [03:56] make trades here now using the MCP
- [03:58] server. So uh I just logged into code in
- [04:00] again. So I have created a custom
- [04:03] command that's called crypto bro. This
- [04:06] is more like an automated way of uh
- [04:09] doing trading. So I set up this uh I'm
- [04:12] going to show you this later, but I set
- [04:13] up this uh workflow here in my/ commands
- [04:17] that has like a stepbystep way of uh
- [04:20] placing a trade, but let's try to do
- [04:22] this manually now just by using the
- [04:24] tools. So uh I'm going to start off with
- [04:26] a prompt here. I want to do uh I want to
- [04:29] place a trade on a cryptocoin. So I can
- [04:31] do uh I want to place a trade on crypto.
- [04:33] Can you start by checking my balance? So
- [04:35] hopefully now with the description we
- [04:36] have this is going to understand that it
- [04:38] has to call the get account tool and
- [04:40] just bring up our $93
- [04:43] balance here, right? Yeah, that was
- [04:45] perfect. So that works good. So we need
- [04:47] some prices. So I'm just going to do
- [04:50] something like
- [04:52] let's just pick four coins. Let's do get
- [04:54] latest pricing for Bitcoin, Ethereum,
- [04:56] Sana, and BNB. So let's just uh do
- [04:59] those. Hopefully now Claude understands
- [05:01] that it needs to do some parallel tool
- [05:02] calling. Perfect. So we use the get
- [05:05] market data uh tooling here to grab all
- [05:08] the information. We have the prices
- [05:10] current price on ether uh Solana and
- [05:13] BNB. Perfect. So now we have the
- [05:16] pricing. We can start thinking about uh
- [05:18] what coin looks the best for making a
- [05:21] trade. So we can just do what coin look
- [05:23] the best for making a trade on at the
- [05:25] moment. So then we are triggering the
- [05:27] analyze funding opportunity. We are
- [05:29] picking BNB. Okay. So let's run that.
- [05:31] And it says BNB is the most interesting
- [05:33] here with a 7 uh minus 747 APR funding
- [05:38] shorts paying long. Okay, but it doesn't
- [05:40] hit the official signal yet. Yeah, we
- [05:43] have some kind of signal we set up. But
- [05:44] just ignore that for now. So you can see
- [05:46] it asked me, do you want to scan all
- [05:48] tradable coins? So I can say yes, do
- [05:50] that. Let's see what happens. Do the
- [05:53] let's do that. Let's trade uh check all
- [05:55] the tradable coins if we can find
- [05:57] something else. So, one of the
- [05:59] suggestion is a 40x leverage trade on
- [06:02] Bitcoin long. So, I'm just going to do
- [06:04] give me all the details on the 40x uh
- [06:06] trade. So, maybe 40x is a bit too much.
- [06:09] Let's do a 20x uh instead. Uh we don't
- [06:13] need a 40x trade. So, let's do a 20x bet
- [06:15] on Bitcoin uh long here. So, what I
- [06:18] think is pretty cool if you have some
- [06:20] questions like you're pretty new to
- [06:22] this, you can always ask, right? So, we
- [06:24] are not trading CFDs. So let me let's
- [06:27] give an explanation of what we are
- [06:29] trading here. So let's just explain
- [06:31] simply what uh per trading is. So this
- [06:34] is a bit different from CFD. So you can
- [06:37] see we get the explanation here. What
- [06:39] are uh perpetual futures? So we can do
- [06:42] long, short and we can leverage this and
- [06:44] yeah, you kind of get the point here. So
- [06:46] yeah, you can also ask some questions.
- [06:48] So yes, do the trade and let's just
- [06:52] [music]
- [06:53] t let's do the trade. And now we're
- [06:55] going to call up our MCP that's going to
- [06:56] place a position. So you can see here
- [06:59] place order Bitcoin is through is by
- [07:02] true leverage 20 size. Okay, perfect.
- [07:04] That was placed. Let's check our
- [07:06] dashboard on Hyperlquid.
- [07:09] And you can see here we have our Bitcoin
- [07:12] 20x long. And now we can kind of monitor
- [07:16] this by clicking here. You can see we
- [07:18] are already 0.2% up. And we can monitor
- [07:22] this here. And you can see we made 21
- [07:24] cents already. So this is pretty snappy,
- [07:26] right? So it's pretty fun to play around
- [07:28] with. And we can close this whenever you
- [07:30] want. And we can kind of set up a
- [07:33] monitor and we can do something like so
- [07:36] we can do a 2 minute sleep and then go
- [07:38] get position. Okay. So you can see we
- [07:40] are running the 120 sleep and after this
- [07:43] is counted down, we're going to get our
- [07:44] position, right? So let's just wait for
- [07:47] that. Okay. So you can see the 2 minutes
- [07:49] are up. Now it's going to trigger kind
- [07:51] of the get position hopefully. I think
- [07:54] so. Yeah, we are reading the shell
- [07:56] output. Hopefully, we're going to get
- [07:57] the position. Perfect. And you can see,
- [08:01] okay, we are doing pretty well on the
- [08:03] Bitcoin. I think if we look here, we are
- [08:05] $2 up. So, I want to close this 2.9% up.
- [08:10] Perfect. Uh, close the BTC post for
- [08:15] profit. Right, you can see 228 up. Close
- [08:19] the position 100%. Boom. We got it. And
- [08:24] we can do a control O. We can read here.
- [08:27] You can see kind of the JSON formatting
- [08:29] here. And yeah, we took the profit. And
- [08:32] now we can get our balance again, right?
- [08:34] Let's see how much we have now. Okay, so
- [08:37] we made a dollar. Perfect. Something
- [08:39] like that. Or at least we have $94 now.
- [08:42] So yeah, that was like a full cycle. Um,
- [08:45] I also have my automated setup. I can
- [08:49] just show you that, but I don't think
- [08:50] we're going to do any more trades now.
- [08:52] So, to do that, it's pretty
- [08:53] straightforward. We can just do
- [08:55] /cryptobro. And now kind of everything
- [08:57] is set up. This should be running
- [09:00] autonomously, right? We are checking the
- [09:02] bag first. That's okay. That was a bit
- [09:06] Yeah. Uh yeah, you can see we are
- [09:08] checking our position. We check for our
- [09:10] open positions. We have the Solana
- [09:12] short. That means we have one position
- [09:14] left because we maximum can have two
- [09:16] open at the same time. So, we just keep
- [09:18] on continuing. And this is more like an
- [09:20] automated setup and we look for a trade
- [09:23] and we can decide if we want to pick
- [09:25] that or not. Right? So, yeah, I'm just
- [09:28] going to let this run through and see
- [09:30] what kind of suggestion we end up with
- [09:31] here. So, you can see uh next trade
- [09:33] lineup, BNB long. Um, yeah, let's do a
- [09:38] BNB long trade. So, we can let that run
- [09:40] for a while. That's fine. We're going to
- [09:42] do an $80 margin and yeah, that's fine.
- [09:46] 10x size.
- [09:48] Uh, run both. Okay. So, you can see
- [09:51] we're going to place this. Nice. And
- [09:53] yeah, that was it. If we go back here
- [09:55] now and we do a refresh, you can see we
- [09:58] have our BNB long trade. Perfect. Uh,
- [10:02] okay. So, yeah, I don't really care what
- [10:04] way this goes, but uh, that was the
- [10:05] point just to show you how this works.
- [10:08] And yeah, pretty simple. So, what I
- [10:09] think is good about this is it's a way
- [10:11] nice way to learn about this because you
- [10:13] can always ask questions on the way. I
- [10:15] do very small positions just to learn
- [10:18] how this works. Uh there's not much edge
- [10:20] in this now, but I was thinking maybe in
- [10:24] the future we can try to add more edge
- [10:25] here. We can give more context and stuff
- [10:27] like that. So there are definitely
- [10:29] opportunities here. And I just had a lot
- [10:32] of fun with this project, setting it up,
- [10:34] playing around. It's so responsive,
- [10:36] right? It's so quick and you can Yeah,
- [10:39] you can see we can make this pretty cool
- [10:41] things here. Here we can do some social
- [10:42] posting on this and it's just a fun
- [10:45] thing to play around with. So you kind
- [10:47] of learn about NCPs while you have some
- [10:49] fun trading some crypto if you're into
- [10:52] that and you just learn about stuff and
- [10:55] ask questions on the run here. So yeah,
- [10:58] had a lot of fun with this. So I
- [11:00] definitely recommend going uh to check
- [11:02] it out.
