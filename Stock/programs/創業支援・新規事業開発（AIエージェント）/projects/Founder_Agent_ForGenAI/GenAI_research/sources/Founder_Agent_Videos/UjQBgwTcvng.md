- [00:00] AI agents are powerful. They reason, adapt
- [00:07] and can act all on their own. And they can create tremendous value for a range of different use
- [00:14] cases like customer service, supply chain, IT operations and many other
- [00:21] tasks. But here's the problem. In production, they can go rogue. Think about it.
- [00:28] An AI agent could make a decision that you can't explain to where you
- [00:35] wouldn't be able to trace the inputs to the outputs.
- [00:42] Or, you could have multiple outputs for the same input and not be
- [00:48] sure of which one is correct. Or worse, it could fail silently in
- [00:55] between and you would not be able to tell where it happened. When that happens,
- [01:01] debugging is almost impossible. Compliance is at risk and most importantly, both
- [01:08] reliability and trust can erode.
- [01:17] In practice, observability for AI agents rests on three key pillars.
- [01:24] First is decision tracing, understanding how the agent came to
- [01:30] decisions to get from the input and output in all of the steps that it took in between. Second
- [01:37] is behavioral monitoring, understanding what the the agent was inferring. Were there any loops
- [01:44] or anomalies that we need to be aware of or other risky patterns? Third is outcome
- [01:51] alignment, starting with get input and context. Did it actually generate the outcome
- [01:58] that was intended? Together, these three things give us transparency,
- [02:04] visibility and operational control. So how does this actually work? It starts with
- [02:11] capturing three types of information. We talked about the inputs in context, basically
- [02:18] the instructions that the agent was given and the initial information that are received. Then we
- [02:25] move on to the decision and reasoning, understanding the thinking that's happening
- [02:30] within the agent to drive towards those actions and results. And then finally, the outcome in
- [02:37] ensuring that it actually matched the intent of what the agents started with. All of these pieces
- [02:43] of information get logged as structured events to understand the behavior
- [02:50] and patterns of the agent. Together, we stitch them together like a timeline to
- [02:57] understand what the agent did, and we can use it like a replay to be able to go back
- [03:04] and understand the behavior and see whether there's anything we need to change. And again,
- [03:10] checking whether the outcome matched the original input and intent. Did the agent
- [03:17] stay aligned with what we wanted it to do, or did we see anomalies? This is where
- [03:23] observability differs from monitoring. Whereas with monitoring you have the raw signals
- [03:30] like the CPU load or the token count or error rates.
- [03:37] With observability, you actually have the the context of the decision trail, being
- [03:44] able to trace everything that was done and be able to analyze that replay and
- [03:50] improve the agent's behavior going forward. So here's the takeaway. Observability for AI agents
- [03:57] isn't just dashboards or metrics. It's a full picture of the inputs,
- [04:03] the decisions that the agent took and the outcomes.
- [04:13] With those three things together, stitched into the timeline that we have, we can understand
- [04:19] what the agent did, why it did it and build that transparent trail that you can
- [04:26] trust, analyze and ultimately improve. That's what makes it possible to operate autonomous
- [04:33] systems reliably at scale.
