- [00:00] You probably already know that Claude
- [00:01] Code is by far the best coding agent in
- [00:04] the world. It can create entire apps
- [00:06] from a simple prompt both front end and
- [00:08] backend. It can blow your mind in terms
- [00:11] of the design of that app. But what you
- [00:13] might not know is you can actually use
- [00:15] Claude Code as a general agent. And
- [00:18] Anthropic released something really
- [00:20] interesting a few weeks ago. they
- [00:21] released what is called Claude skills
- [00:25] which is just a special type of markdown
- [00:27] file which allows you to surround claude
- [00:31] code with relevant skills. So if you
- [00:34] wished that you had an AI agent that had
- [00:36] relevant skills, I believe that this is
- [00:38] probably the most important thing that
- [00:40] you could be studying right now. And so
- [00:43] in this video, we're going to talk about
- [00:44] how to set up Claude skills. We're also
- [00:47] going to talk about how to use Claude
- [00:48] code as a general agent. And we're going
- [00:50] to talk about how you need to set up
- [00:52] your skill.md file and what folders. And
- [00:55] I'm going to show you how to just use AI
- [00:58] to create these skills. Let's talk about
- [01:00] building a general agent with relevant
- [01:02] skills for your business. Whether you're
- [01:03] a content creator, business owner,
- [01:05] aspiring entrepreneur, we're going to
- [01:07] build an agent with relevant skills to
- [01:10] you and we're going to use that agent.
- [01:11] Let's dive in. Okay. So, we're going to
- [01:14] start off by talking about what is a
- [01:15] coding agent. You may have heard of
- [01:17] lovable and this video is not about
- [01:19] lovable. We're not even going to use
- [01:20] lovable. I just wanted to make a point
- [01:22] real quick. So many people are talking
- [01:24] about vibe coding. You can use tools
- [01:25] like lovable, replet, vibe code. These
- [01:28] are coding agents that you can use to
- [01:30] build apps. And whenever I go to lovable
- [01:34] and type in uh make a landing
- [01:37] landing page about pizza
- [01:41] right now, what it's doing is it's
- [01:43] spinning up a sandbox which is basically
- [01:46] a virtual computer and it's going to run
- [01:49] an AI agent or an AI coding agent on the
- [01:52] side. Now, it's going to generate a
- [01:54] bunch of files within a directory or
- [01:57] codebase, and those files are going to
- [02:01] make an app. And so, this is an AI
- [02:04] coding agent at work building an app.
- [02:07] Okay, so it's done. The lovable coding
- [02:09] agent took my prompt, make a landing
- [02:12] page about pizza. It generated all of
- [02:14] the files. This coding agent decided
- [02:16] what files it needed to generate. it
- [02:18] generated them and then it probably
- [02:21] reviewed those files and then it ran the
- [02:24] program in a virtual computer somewhere
- [02:26] so I can see it on my uh browser because
- [02:30] this is within a web browser and so this
- [02:32] is an example of an agent made
- [02:34] specifically for creating simple
- [02:36] applications a very narrow agent
- [02:39] experience where it's made specifically
- [02:41] for creating certain types of apps with
- [02:44] certain stacks and we could do this same
- [02:46] thing on our computer, right? We could
- [02:49] do the same thing on our computer. If we
- [02:51] were to go to Finder, we can just go
- [02:54] straight into our downloads, right? We
- [02:56] can go straight into our downloads and
- [02:57] we could go new folder. We can go like
- [03:00] this. We can say using quad code, right?
- [03:04] So, we don't even need any IDE or
- [03:07] something like cursor or lovable. I can
- [03:10] open a terminal window. I can open a new
- [03:13] terminal at this folder and we can just
- [03:16] run claude. So now we're running claude
- [03:19] code in this empty folder called using
- [03:22] claude code which is an empty folder and
- [03:25] I can just say please build a beautiful
- [03:27] amazing landing page for my pizza shop
- [03:31] Riley's Pizza Shop. Make it in the style
- [03:34] of neo brutalism mixed with a friendly
- [03:37] pizza energy. So just like lovable, we
- [03:41] can run this and claude code in this
- [03:43] empty folder is going to create the
- [03:46] application right here. Okay, check this
- [03:48] out. It just generated an index.html
- [03:51] file. And there we go. It created a file
- [03:55] the same way that Lovable is creating
- [03:58] all the different files and putting them
- [03:59] in a folder in some virtual machine.
- [04:02] It's just a virtual computer. We're
- [04:04] doing this on our computer. It's doing
- [04:06] the same exact thing Lovable is doing.
- [04:08] And the point I want to make here, you
- [04:10] can just use these coding models on your
- [04:13] computer and coding files, right? This
- [04:16] is an HTML file and this is a CSS file.
- [04:19] This is not the only type of file you
- [04:22] can create with cloud code. You can
- [04:24] create any type of file. So it is done.
- [04:27] And if we just copy this link right here
- [04:29] and we paste in localhost80,
- [04:32] we can run this on our computer. This is
- [04:35] running locally on our computer. where
- [04:37] Lovable in Lovable's case, it just
- [04:39] created a virtual machine and it ran it
- [04:41] on that computer and it showed you what
- [04:44] it created on the browser. Now, we're
- [04:47] running this fully on our computer and
- [04:49] we didn't use any like software in
- [04:52] between. We generated the code files
- [04:54] with an AI coding agent on our computer.
- [04:57] It used an AI model from anthropic
- [05:00] servers to create those files. So that's
- [05:02] where it costs money, but we didn't use
- [05:04] any other software other than getting
- [05:07] Claude to generate all the files. And
- [05:09] we're running it on our MacBook Pro. And
- [05:12] this is the website that it created. And
- [05:14] you'll notice that in my opinion, I've
- [05:17] tested every single one of these coding
- [05:19] agents. Just raw Claude code is the best
- [05:23] in the world. So Replet and lovable,
- [05:25] they have their own coding agents.
- [05:26] Claude Code out of the box is better
- [05:28] than all of them. And so what I want to
- [05:31] explain now is how you can use this as a
- [05:35] general agent. So this right here is
- [05:38] Obsidian. And this is just a basic notes
- [05:41] app where every file instead of the
- [05:44] files uh being an HTML file or a
- [05:47] JavaScript file or a CSS file which
- [05:50] ultimately created this uh application
- [05:52] that we can use. Instead of it being one
- [05:56] of those types of files, these are all
- [05:57] markdown files. So the way that I use
- [05:59] general agents is I actually use claude
- [06:02] code at the same location as my notes
- [06:07] like this is my agent workspace. This is
- [06:10] kind of how I think about this. This is
- [06:11] a notebook and Riley Brown uses this as
- [06:14] his personal notebook so that he can be
- [06:16] a better CMO and co-founder of the Vibe
- [06:18] Code app. And I basically state all of
- [06:20] my goals. Why am I stating this? I I
- [06:23] know my goals. Why am I writing this?
- [06:25] because I don't use this by myself. I
- [06:28] use this with my general agent which is
- [06:30] Claude Code. And what I can do here is I
- [06:32] can actually click on this or I can
- [06:35] rightclick on this and hit reveal in
- [06:37] Finder. So here we can see Riley content
- [06:40] creation. That's basically what I called
- [06:42] this file. And you'll see here all of
- [06:45] these different files here. Um like this
- [06:49] is just a wrapper of these files that
- [06:51] are showing up on my computer, right?
- [06:53] This is just in my computer. And so the
- [06:56] same way that I ran claude code in a new
- [06:59] folder, I can run claude code in this
- [07:02] folder. So I can reveal this in finder.
- [07:04] What I'm going to do is I'm going to
- [07:05] rightclick services, new terminal at
- [07:09] folder, right? New terminal at folder.
- [07:12] Now you can see here that it is running.
- [07:14] So we're in this folder right here,
- [07:16] which is the same folder where all of
- [07:17] this is located. And now we can run uh
- [07:20] claude. And so now we have cloud code
- [07:23] running in the folder that has all of my
- [07:28] notes. And so I can use it with cloud
- [07:29] code. So I could go into tasks, right?
- [07:32] And and this is how I keep track of my
- [07:34] tasks. I could go into Q. Um let's say
- [07:36] these are both done, right? This is
- [07:38] these are the things that I want to do.
- [07:40] Um and so in my queue, one thing that I
- [07:42] do want to do, and I can just drag this
- [07:44] in here. One thing that I do want to do
- [07:46] is I want to explain Claude skills to my
- [07:51] audience and make a video. Right? This
- [07:54] is one thing I really want to do. Um I
- [07:56] want to um share the file structure um
- [07:59] with of Claude skills. And then I want
- [08:01] to take my notebook and examine what
- [08:04] Claude skills would be useful for me to
- [08:07] create. And I'm I'm uh do this on this
- [08:09] page. Don't create or edit any other
- [08:12] files. Just make a plan and do it. Okay.
- [08:14] So, we just created this markdown file
- [08:16] of this thing that I want to do. The
- [08:18] cool thing is I can just ask Claude Code
- [08:19] to do it. I can just say, "Do what's in
- [08:22] my queue." Right? That's all I need to
- [08:24] say. I can say, "Yo, do what's in my
- [08:26] queue." And because the first thing that
- [08:29] this agent's going to do is analyze the
- [08:30] readme file. It's going to see how it's
- [08:33] organized, right? It's going to know
- [08:34] that there's tasks. It's going to know
- [08:36] what the queue is, draft tasks. So, it's
- [08:39] just going to know to check the queue.
- [08:41] And because Claude Code is such a
- [08:42] powerful agent and it's really good at
- [08:45] looking through the code base, in this
- [08:47] case, which is just a bunch of my notes,
- [08:49] it's going to find the right location.
- [08:51] It's really smart. And it's going to
- [08:53] find this page, and it's just going to
- [08:54] do what I want it to do. And we'll just
- [08:56] wait for Cloud Code to do that. And
- [08:58] you'll see here that we never said to
- [09:00] look at this file. It doesn't know that
- [09:02] I have this file open. It just found
- [09:04] what's in my queue. And you can see here
- [09:06] it's examining notebook for skill ideas.
- [09:09] It found the right file and now it's
- [09:10] creating the relevant things. Allow it
- [09:12] to edit this session. Boom. Look at
- [09:15] that. So, it just added all of this. It
- [09:19] added all of this
- [09:22] to this document. It told us what skills
- [09:25] are, right? And it told us that uh from
- [09:29] the anthropic skills repo, it it
- [09:31] basically did research. It found uh the
- [09:34] clawed skills repo. And now it is
- [09:37] telling us that you can create within
- [09:39] the claude.md file. You can create a
- [09:43] skill by creating a folder with the
- [09:45] skill name. And inside that folder, it
- [09:48] needs to have a claude or a skill.md
- [09:51] file. And then you can put optional uh
- [09:54] resources within that folder. And so you
- [09:56] can even put assets, references, etc.
- [09:59] And I'll get to that in just a second.
- [10:00] The point I wanted to make is the same
- [10:03] way lovable was a coding specific
- [10:06] example of using an agent. This is a
- [10:09] notes specific example for using an
- [10:11] agent. So I promise you we are we're
- [10:14] working our way up to creating claude
- [10:16] skills. I just wanted to illustrate the
- [10:18] point. I wanted to talk about what a
- [10:20] domain specific agent was like the
- [10:21] lovable agent that can create apps. Then
- [10:23] I showed you a note takingaking example
- [10:25] where you can use claude code as a
- [10:27] general agent. Now, we're going to use
- [10:29] it in a wide openen world within cursor.
- [10:33] And we can do literally whatever we
- [10:35] want. I like to use cursor because it's
- [10:38] just the best in my opinion for quickly
- [10:40] using claude code. And it's ironic
- [10:42] because I use we can just say claude
- [10:45] code skills. So, what uh we're going to
- [10:50] be creating claude skills in this
- [10:52] project. So, I'll just name it that. And
- [10:55] now it is opening up this directory in
- [10:58] an IDE. So cloud uh a cursor is just an
- [11:02] IDE like VS Code where you can view all
- [11:05] the files. And so the way that I vibe
- [11:07] code is I'm just going to come in here
- [11:08] and the first thing that I'm going to do
- [11:10] is hit command J. We're going to open up
- [11:11] the terminal and we're going to type
- [11:12] claude. Then we're going to press this
- [11:15] right here to open up the side panel.
- [11:18] And so now we have Claude code on the
- [11:21] left or on the right. controlling this
- [11:25] directory which is claude code skills
- [11:28] and what we're going to do here is I'm
- [11:30] going to say please take a look at this
- [11:34] direct or at this repo and I'm going to
- [11:37] paste this GitHub uh to the anthropic
- [11:39] skills right here please create one
- [11:43] simple skill in the right format so that
- [11:48] you will use this skill when you need
- [11:53] to. Okay. So, right now it's creating an
- [11:55] example skill. What it's going to do is
- [11:58] it's going to create a cloud file. It's
- [12:01] going to create a cloud file. As you can
- [12:04] see here, it's created this.cloud file.
- [12:07] It's also going to create a skills
- [12:09] folder as you'll see in just a second.
- [12:11] Okay, there you go. It created a folder
- [12:15] called.cloud
- [12:17] and then it created a skills folder
- [12:19] within that. And then it has other
- [12:22] folders beneath it. So it created this
- [12:24] summarized folder with a skill MD.
- [12:26] That's all you need to create a skill.
- [12:28] You just need to put in the docloud
- [12:30] folder because cloud code knows to look
- [12:31] in thecloud folder for certain things
- [12:33] like sub aents and now skills. We're not
- [12:36] talking about sub aents in this video.
- [12:37] We're just talking about skills. So we
- [12:39] created the skills folder. And within
- [12:41] this folder, right, we see this
- [12:42] skill.md.
- [12:44] And every single skill.mmd file should
- [12:47] be formatted with the name and
- [12:49] description. Right? It should have a
- [12:52] name and description. You can see here
- [12:54] that this one that I've created is
- [12:56] called brand voice, which is skill
- [12:59] number one. And then there is a name and
- [13:01] description. And so the name is just a
- [13:03] human-friendly title. It can be
- [13:04] anything. But the crucial part is this
- [13:07] description because it tells Claude code
- [13:09] when to use this skill. And so we're
- [13:13] reaching a point where you can get
- [13:14] agents to do things with a simple
- [13:15] markdown file. But what you need to do
- [13:18] is you need to make sure that you format
- [13:19] it correctly so Cloud Code knows when to
- [13:22] follow your instructions. Because
- [13:24] basically all skills are the way that I
- [13:27] think about them is they are just SOPs
- [13:30] or standard operating procedures. SOPs
- [13:34] for agents. And so right these are
- [13:37] instructions on what to do in certain
- [13:39] scenarios. And if you put a high quality
- [13:42] description, it'll know what instruction
- [13:45] manual or SOP to use when it needs to do
- [13:49] a specific task. And so I don't really
- [13:52] want to use this summarize skill. I
- [13:54] actually want to create a skill that's
- [13:56] much more relevant to me. Okay. So I
- [13:58] just want to show you what I've been
- [13:59] doing. I've been annotating. I've been
- [14:02] annotating my Twitter posts because I
- [14:04] can give these to Claude. I can put
- [14:07] these in Claude skills so that the agent
- [14:09] knows how I post. And so I can say short
- [14:12] video attached to this photo. This is a
- [14:16] Twitter account that I run by the way
- [14:18] that helps me grow Vibe Code. And I can
- [14:20] say um uh senior vibe coder
- [14:26] is ragebait
- [14:28] and works. I don't do this often, right?
- [14:32] Okay. And I just put this directly on
- [14:34] the image. And it helps me kind of
- [14:36] annotate my images here. And I'm just
- [14:39] going to hit I'm just going to exit out.
- [14:41] Hit save. And we can save all these. And
- [14:44] so what we can do here is we can just
- [14:45] take all of these files. We can drag
- [14:47] them in here. And what I'm going to do
- [14:49] is I'm just going to put a new skill
- [14:52] here. And what we can do is we can just
- [14:55] drag these images in here. Now we're
- [14:57] going to go to cloud code. I want you to
- [15:00] replace this uh summarize skill. And
- [15:03] because this is a folder, right? Uh I
- [15:07] can just type at summarize, right? I can
- [15:10] say replace this summarize skill. Uh
- [15:13] this skill, the whole summarize skill uh
- [15:16] should be replaced with a Twitter post X
- [15:20] post skill. This skill should allow the
- [15:23] agent to create tweets in my style and
- [15:26] use the images that are in the at new in
- [15:30] the new skill here folder as a
- [15:32] reference. So please create that skill
- [15:37] now. So we're basically going to tell
- [15:39] cloud code to analyze these images. It's
- [15:41] going to look for patterns in how I
- [15:43] speak. And actually one thing I can
- [15:45] mention, I just hit the backspace.
- [15:48] Just know the red text in these images
- [15:53] are annotations. So that's not part of
- [15:56] the post. These are my annotations to
- [15:57] you on why I did certain things. So take
- [15:59] that into consideration when
- [16:00] constructing this skill, right? So I
- [16:02] annotated why I did what I did. So this
- [16:05] gives some extra context to Cloud Code
- [16:07] and it's going to packages it package it
- [16:08] as a skill. And so in theory whenever I
- [16:10] ask for a Twitter post to claude code in
- [16:12] the future uh within this repo it should
- [16:15] be able to do it in my style because
- [16:18] I've given it relevant context. Okay. So
- [16:20] there you go. It created this skill.md
- [16:23] file and all it did was analyze all of
- [16:26] those images. It converted them into
- [16:29] these uh markdown formats and it
- [16:32] converted it into a skill. What it
- [16:35] didn't do is I didn't specify this. Uh
- [16:38] that was just a temporary folder. Please
- [16:40] remove that folder, but add those images
- [16:42] into that skill folder as references
- [16:45] because this doesn't need to be here.
- [16:47] This can just go into the skill and
- [16:50] right. So right now we have two skills.
- [16:52] We're going to add another skill in just
- [16:54] a second. So we have one skill and every
- [16:56] skill needs a claw.md file. So it just
- [16:59] created this and now it has these
- [17:01] references that it can use right here.
- [17:03] What we can do if we want references
- [17:07] uh to posts
- [17:10] and we can select all of these and we
- [17:12] can just like move them in here.
- [17:14] So we have references and then the
- [17:17] skill.md file. You need this skill.md
- [17:19] file, right? And so what we can do, I
- [17:22] want you to create a markdown file in
- [17:28] the root. And when I say in the root, I
- [17:32] mean right there's the the folder that
- [17:35] we opened up originally which is claude
- [17:37] code skills. This is the root folder. So
- [17:39] it should put it in below thecloud
- [17:42] folder. The dotcloud folder is also in
- [17:44] the root. The skills folder is in the
- [17:46] do.cloud folder. Thus not in the root.
- [17:48] Just wanted to be clear. uh in the root
- [17:51] and come up with 10
- [17:55] ideas for the Twitter copy based on my
- [18:01] last video where I explained Claude
- [18:07] skills
- [18:08] should match and then I can uh give it
- [18:11] that GitHub repo link I mentioned skills
- [18:16] and explained why it's important.
- [18:19] important for general use cases for like
- [18:25] marketing
- [18:26] and as general agent. Okay. So, let's
- [18:30] say I made this video because I'm making
- [18:32] this video right now. What I would
- [18:33] probably do is feed in the transcript of
- [18:35] this video and then it would generate 10
- [18:37] options. So, it would have more context
- [18:39] of the video we're creating. But since
- [18:41] I'm making the video right now, I can't
- [18:43] give it the transcript. Um, but that's
- [18:45] okay. It's going to create a markdown
- [18:47] file in the root and it's going to use
- [18:49] this skill. Okay, so it is done. Okay,
- [18:52] you'll see that when you see this green
- [18:55] dot and it shows expost right here. When
- [18:57] you see this green dot and it has
- [18:59] expost, that means it's using that
- [19:02] skill, right? It is using the expost
- [19:06] skill.
- [19:08] And we're going to allow it to create
- [19:09] these files. And boom, Twitter ideas.
- [19:13] So, here we go. Cloud Code just became a
- [19:16] general agent, not a chatbot, an agent
- [19:19] that does your workflows. Enthropic just
- [19:22] released skills, reusable prompt
- [19:24] templates, invoke with slash commands,
- [19:26] marketing teams. Okay, so this is really
- [19:28] good. Oh my, this shouldn't be possible.
- [19:31] I turned Claude into my personal
- [19:33] marketing team. Social media copy on
- [19:36] demand, email sequences in seconds,
- [19:38] brand voice locked in permanently. Zero
- [19:41] prompting every time. How Claude skills
- [19:44] one markdown file infinite workflows.
- [19:47] This is very good. So it wrote this in
- [19:51] my voice using this skill. But it gets
- [19:54] much cooler than this. So if we were to
- [19:57] go to um let's go to arc. So we're going
- [20:01] to go to typefully.com. And in typefully
- [20:05] we can go to settings and we could go to
- [20:10] API and we can hit new API key. And so
- [20:15] this is going to be test key
- [20:18] for me. Create API key. I'm going to
- [20:22] delete this right after this video. And
- [20:25] then what I'm going to do is I'm going
- [20:26] to click on this docs. And this explains
- [20:29] exactly how to use this API key. So,
- [20:31] what I'm trying to do here is I don't
- [20:33] want it to just come up with ideas. I
- [20:34] want them to draft them in this tool
- [20:37] where I can post directly to social
- [20:39] media. So, in theory, I could have an
- [20:41] agent uh come up with tweets uh and
- [20:44] automatically
- [20:46] draft them within Titefully because
- [20:48] that's what you can do here on this
- [20:49] platform, right? We could have it
- [20:51] directly post this as a um a draft here,
- [20:56] right? It can schedule a new draft. And
- [20:58] so, that's exactly what I'm going to
- [20:59] tell it. So I want you to add to our
- [21:05] x post skill. I'm using the software
- [21:09] typley and I want you to instead of
- [21:11] basically instead of putting these in a
- [21:12] document, I want you to actually
- [21:13] directly schedule these as a draft on
- [21:15] tightfully. And so I am going to give it
- [21:17] these docs to the API. Here are the docs
- [21:19] to read. Here is my API key. It is in a
- [21:22] text file, right? So I don't want to
- [21:24] expose it. What I'm going to do is I'm
- [21:26] just going to go I'm going to go key.txt
- [21:28] txt. I'm going to paste my key right
- [21:31] here. So, I pasted my key in this file
- [21:33] and I can just go at key.txt.
- [21:37] It is here. Please add to the skill
- [21:41] using claude skills. And I'm going to
- [21:44] mention this link right here. Please
- [21:46] make this skill such that it schedules
- [21:51] it as a draft to this typefully account.
- [21:57] It should not post or schedule. Okay,
- [22:01] now we're going to wait for the skill
- [22:04] called expost to be uh messed with.
- [22:08] Okay, so it is done. And here we can see
- [22:11] that your accounts available is Riley
- [22:15] Brown vibe code vibe coding explained.
- [22:17] Okay, so this works. Maybe maybe uh
- [22:21] please test this by um drafting
- [22:26] one of the items in the list
- [22:31] that we generated in and then we can
- [22:35] just go claude skills Twitter ideas.
- [22:38] Okay. Okay. It looks like it is done. If
- [22:41] we come back here. Okay. It created
- [22:44] this, right? It created this on vibe
- [22:46] coding explained. Okay. Now on the Riley
- [22:50] Brown account, draft a post that says,
- [22:56] "Hi, this is a test." Okay, so it's
- [23:00] done. If we go back to Arc, we go to
- [23:03] Riley.
- [23:05] Here we go. We see, "Hi, this is a test.
- [23:07] This was 34 seconds ago." So that's
- [23:10] pretty cool. We can have it draft posts.
- [23:14] I'm going to just reset the context
- [23:16] here. Um, so we're opening up a new
- [23:19] cloud instance to reset it, right? We're
- [23:22] resetting it uh so that there's no
- [23:24] context in here. And I'm going to say, I
- [23:27] just created a tightfully
- [23:30] video that explains how I created a
- [23:34] Claude code skill in order to uh post on
- [23:38] all my Twitter accounts via Typefully. I
- [23:41] want you to draft up three exposts and
- [23:44] draft them on Typefully on the Vibe
- [23:46] Coding Explained account. Oops, I
- [23:48] misspelled it. Typefully
- [23:52] is the app.
- [23:55] Okay, so we interrupted it, but it was
- [23:57] using the Expost skill. It should go
- [23:58] back to using the Expost skill. Okay, do
- [24:02] I want to proceed? Yes. Okay, so the
- [24:06] drafts were created. Oo, it has a link
- [24:09] associated with it. Wait, what happens
- [24:11] if we just go to this link? Wow,
- [24:15] skills repo. It even included that repo.
- [24:17] No way. You can build custom skills for
- [24:19] cloud code, automate repetitive
- [24:21] workflows, create one-click commands,
- [24:23] share skills across projects. Zero
- [24:25] coding required. Just dropped a full
- [24:28] walkth through how to do this. Wow.
- [24:30] Okay, so it created these posts using
- [24:33] the typefully or the expost skill and in
- [24:38] this skill.md file, it has access to
- [24:42] this code, right? You can it has this
- [24:44] code that I can that the claude code can
- [24:46] use to post this on social media. And
- [24:51] what I need to do now is I need to
- [24:52] delete my API key because I probably
- [24:54] exposed it. All right, so there you go.
- [24:56] We just created a general agent and we
- [24:59] gave it a skill. And you know what? I
- [25:01] think that's enough for you to get
- [25:03] started. I don't want to like go crazy
- [25:05] and create like an agent swarm or an
- [25:08] agent with a ton of different skills,
- [25:10] but we just created a we used claude
- [25:13] within cursor to create an agent. And
- [25:15] then we just created one simple skill.
- [25:17] And this is enough for you to get
- [25:19] started because as you saw, I just gave
- [25:21] it the link which I'll put in the
- [25:23] description to the Claude code skills.
- [25:25] So claude code can make your skills for
- [25:27] you and remember you just create you
- [25:30] know you have the root folder right and
- [25:32] then within your project you just have
- [25:34] aclad pro uh folder then you have
- [25:38] another folder uh which is your skills
- [25:41] folder and then within that you just
- [25:44] have the skill name. So this is just
- [25:46] skill uh skill-1 folder and then in here
- [25:51] you have a uh a skill
- [25:55] md file and within that file it will
- [25:58] have a name and description and cloud
- [26:02] code will do that for you. Just make
- [26:03] sure that when you create these skills
- [26:05] right because you can create many of
- [26:07] these. You can create skill one which we
- [26:09] did um and we didn't create more than
- [26:11] one skill right you can create as many
- [26:13] skills as you want. I wouldn't go
- [26:15] overboard, but if you want to create a
- [26:18] general purpose agent and use Cloud
- [26:19] Code, this is how you can do it. And you
- [26:21] can create a bunch of different skills.
- [26:24] And so, in the description down below
- [26:25] this video, you'll find a link to a
- [26:27] webinar. I'm just going to do like a big
- [26:29] live stream where we're going to create
- [26:32] a really cool uh agent interface with a
- [26:35] ton of different skills. We're going to
- [26:36] do it live. It's going to be like 3 to
- [26:38] four hours long. And so, if you want to
- [26:40] sign up for that, that's in the
- [26:42] description. It's going to be sick. But
- [26:44] uh yeah, this is just part two of my
- [26:46] general agent series. I made part one on
- [26:49] Obsidian and I'm just going to continue
- [26:50] this because I'm becoming much more
- [26:52] interested in creating agents with
- [26:56] skills. And in the future, we're going
- [26:58] to mix agent skills with also apps.
- [27:02] We're going to create a little interface
- [27:04] where we can alternate between using an
- [27:05] app that we create and the agent and we
- [27:08] can create things that both me and the
- [27:10] agent can use. It's going to be like an
- [27:11] agent interface or an agent workspace.
- [27:14] And that's what we're going to talk
- [27:15] about in the next video. Uh so thank you
- [27:17] guys for watching.
