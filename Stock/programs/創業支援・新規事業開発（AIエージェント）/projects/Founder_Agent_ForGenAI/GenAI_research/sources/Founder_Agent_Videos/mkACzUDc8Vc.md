- [00:00] Let's learn how we can upgrade our AI
- [00:01] agents by creating MCPs that can connect
- [00:03] to any API found on the internet. And
- [00:06] the way we're going to do that is we're
- [00:07] going to use Speak Easy's new platform
- [00:08] here called Graham. Welcome back y'all.
- [00:10] Today's video is sponsored by Speak
- [00:12] Easy. They reached out to me and they're
- [00:13] like, Corbin, we got a pretty big
- [00:14] update. I said, "What's the update?" And
- [00:16] they said they released Graham here,
- [00:17] which allows us to build out fully
- [00:19] customizable MCPS. And after using it, I
- [00:22] have to admit, this cloud MCP platform
- [00:25] is probably one of the best I've seen.
- [00:26] It really allows you to create a nice
- [00:28] little mosaic masterpiece of different
- [00:30] blocks of APIs you can find on the
- [00:32] internet and connect them all together
- [00:33] to create an awesome toolkit which then
- [00:34] your AI agent can use whether it's in
- [00:36] cursor AI claw chat GBT. Therefore,
- [00:38] let's check this out step by step how we
- [00:40] do this. Let's hit start building. I'll
- [00:42] make sure I leave a link to the platform
- [00:44] in the description down below. What
- [00:45] we're going to do first here is set up
- [00:47] our MCP server. We're going to say get
- [00:48] started. Now step one here is what API
- [00:51] do you want to connect to? I'll also
- [00:52] leave Ampify in the description down
- [00:54] below. This is a store that essentially
- [00:56] we can connect to a bunch of different
- [00:57] APIs whether that is a Google map
- [00:59] scraper, a website content crawler,
- [01:02] Facebook ad library scraper, whatever it
- [01:04] is, you simply come to this site, type
- [01:06] it in. So in today's video, we're going
- [01:07] to be leveraging the YouTube one, the
- [01:09] YouTube scraper. Therefore, in this
- [01:10] video, you're going to learn how to
- [01:11] integrate any API found on Ampify and in
- [01:13] addition any API documentation that
- [01:15] exists on the internet as we'll be
- [01:16] integrating Bumbo's API as well. So
- [01:18] first things first, we got to get the
- [01:20] spec here. To do that, go ahead and sign
- [01:21] up for a free account on Ampify. I'm
- [01:23] just going to choose YouTube scraper
- [01:24] here. What I'm looking for here is the
- [01:26] top right. Hit the open API definition.
- [01:28] This is going to give us the relevant
- [01:30] specifications needed in order to attach
- [01:32] that to our MCP. Don't make this
- [01:34] difficult, y'all. Essentially, what this
- [01:36] file is that we're about to download and
- [01:38] give to Graham here is all the different
- [01:40] actions that are specific to the API.
- [01:42] So, for this YouTube one, it's
- [01:43] essentially like, can we grab the title
- [01:45] of the video? Can we grab the duration
- [01:47] of the video? Can we grab the thumbnail
- [01:49] data for the video? Just simple stuff
- [01:51] like that. Little actions you'll see
- [01:52] here. This will be a little bit more
- [01:53] crystal clear once we do the bump ups as
- [01:55] well as I'll show you a one by one
- [01:56] comparison. But for now, I'm going to
- [01:58] copy to make our lives easy. Instead of
- [01:59] us needing to create a new file in the
- [02:01] IDE, I'm just going to ask cursor to do
- [02:02] it for us. So, I'm going to take that.
- [02:03] I'm going to paste that and simply say
- [02:05] this. I'm going to say, okay, see these
- [02:07] open API specs, make it so I could
- [02:09] download as a JSON. I pasted it above
- [02:12] here and hit enter. Now, you might be
- [02:14] asking, Corbin, how do you know it's
- [02:15] ajson? If you come back over to Graham,
- [02:17] right above my head, you'll see it
- [02:19] accepts.yml, yaml.yiml andjson. In
- [02:22] theory, we could also just go into our
- [02:24] IDE here, create a new file.yamel and
- [02:27] paste it that way or JSON and paste it
- [02:29] that way. In addition, if you don't have
- [02:31] access to cursor AI, just use any AI
- [02:34] model and essentially ask for the exact
- [02:36] same thing. And there we go. It saved it
- [02:37] to my desktop. So, let's go ahead and
- [02:39] start here. I'm going to go ahead and
- [02:40] drag it into here. Boom. We're going to
- [02:42] give it a very specific name here. So,
- [02:43] honestly, the name it gave it was pretty
- [02:45] good, but we'll just say YouTube scraper
- [02:47] is fine. Continue. Next, it's going to
- [02:49] have all the relevant actions. So, I
- [02:51] know these look a little confusing.
- [02:52] Don't worry. We're just going to hit
- [02:53] continue here. And essentially, what we
- [02:55] can do is we're going to be able to
- [02:57] rename those to specifically what we
- [02:58] care about. This is going to be our slug
- [03:01] for our MCP. This is how we're going to
- [03:02] reference it. This is fundamentally
- [03:03] pretty important here. And because I'm
- [03:05] going to create a pretty cool one here
- [03:06] that is a multi-layer MCP that accesses
- [03:09] different APIs for a very specific
- [03:11] action, we're going to name it this
- [03:13] YouTube grab. as we're not only going to
- [03:15] be leveraging a YouTube scraper, we're
- [03:17] also going to be leveraging bumps API
- [03:19] here, which allows us to chat with
- [03:21] YouTube videos, ask for timestamps for
- [03:22] YouTube videos, takeaways, everything
- [03:24] like this. So, hit continue. Perfect.
- [03:26] Now that we've created our MCP server, I
- [03:27] can click into it. There's going to be a
- [03:29] bunch of settings. We're going to jump
- [03:30] around here, but first, let's just
- [03:31] configure our actions. And these tools
- [03:34] are the different things that the actor
- [03:36] can do. So, we got YouTube scraper, run
- [03:38] sync, streamers, YouTube scraper. So if
- [03:39] you want more information about your
- [03:41] underlying API and what it can do, you
- [03:43] just jump over to essentially where you
- [03:45] got it from. So for here, this is appy
- [03:47] and then YouTube scraper. For me, I know
- [03:49] what this means. So I'm just going to do
- [03:50] edit here. And instead of YouTube
- [03:52] scraper da da da da, we're just going to
- [03:53] say YouTube scraper get data. This is
- [03:55] how I'm going to get the relevant title,
- [03:57] thumbnail data, and everything we would
- [03:59] want. So now that we have a nice little
- [04:00] YouTube scraper bot, let's add an
- [04:01] additional API here, which we bump up.
- [04:03] So add API. Same process, y'all. So,
- [04:06] simply coming to the documentation here,
- [04:07] we can click here, download JSON or
- [04:09] YAML. We'll do JSON. I'm then going to
- [04:11] drag it into here. We can name it. So,
- [04:13] we can do bumpups. We just do bump ups
- [04:14] here. This is good. And make continue.
- [04:16] And here we go. We got six new tools.
- [04:18] Continue. So, now that we've added bump
- [04:20] ups here, we can add this as additional
- [04:22] actions. So, if you recall, we created
- [04:24] our MCP server of YouTube Scraper. That
- [04:26] is going to be where we host all the
- [04:27] different tools. If I come back over
- [04:29] here to our tool set, we got bumpups and
- [04:31] the original tool set of YouTube
- [04:33] scraper. If I want to add tools to my
- [04:35] MCP server, I simply go to the YouTube
- [04:37] scraper MCP tool set and I say add
- [04:40] tools. With that done, what you'll
- [04:42] notice is that bumpups has all these
- [04:44] tools we can select. I don't have to
- [04:45] select all of them, but for the purpose
- [04:47] of this video, we'll go ahead and do
- [04:48] that. Now, here is one thing that you
- [04:50] can identify right off the bat, and this
- [04:51] will make more sense to you. Now, notice
- [04:54] bumpups create chat. What is this tool,
- [04:56] Corbin? Where is this coming from? This
- [04:58] is coming from our bumpups API and
- [05:00] specifically the chat endpoint. Create
- [05:03] chat response. What we're functionally
- [05:05] doing here is now giving this MCP server
- [05:07] the ability to call this and get data
- [05:11] like this. So nice. Let's go ahead and
- [05:13] add all these add six tools. So what you
- [05:14] notice is that once we add bumpups here,
- [05:16] it does require us to add an environment
- [05:18] variable. You might be asking yourself,
- [05:19] Corbin, how do you know that? Is because
- [05:21] if we go back to bumpus API here, you
- [05:23] can notice in the top right, it requires
- [05:25] an API key to even do the call. This is
- [05:28] like an open AI API key. This is like a
- [05:30] clawed API key. It just tells the
- [05:32] service provider in this context bumpups
- [05:34] that yes, they have the rights to get
- [05:36] the data relevant to what they're
- [05:38] requesting. So to do this, we're going
- [05:39] to come to environments here. We'll
- [05:41] select new environment. Give it a name.
- [05:42] So this is going to be for that YouTube
- [05:44] scraper. So YouTube data, we'll just
- [05:46] call it submit. Fill for tool set as we
- [05:49] just created that tool set together.
- [05:50] YouTube scraper fill variables. When it
- [05:53] comes to the YouTube scraper server URL
- [05:55] and the bumpup server URL, usually we
- [05:56] can leave these blank. Not that big of a
- [05:58] deal, but we need to fill in for this
- [06:00] bumpups API key off. I'm going to go and
- [06:02] just paste it there. I know you can see
- [06:03] it, but don't worry, I'm going delete
- [06:04] it. I made save. There we go. One big
- [06:06] thing for you to know is that when you
- [06:08] create more and more connections to
- [06:10] other API servers, this is where you're
- [06:12] going to be putting those environment
- [06:14] variables that are relevant if it's
- [06:16] needed. Now, a lot of the times because
- [06:17] of the fact that if you're using this
- [06:19] within claude or cursor, you kind of
- [06:21] already have access to the AI model that
- [06:22] way. So, maybe you're not worrying too
- [06:24] much about like can I use my OpenAI API
- [06:27] key here because it's already inherently
- [06:29] part of the logic, right? The idea
- [06:31] behind Graham and this MCP server is to
- [06:33] really simplify your ability to
- [06:35] integrate this into different workflows,
- [06:37] specifically AI workflows, as you'll see
- [06:39] here with a custom tool ability. It's
- [06:41] pretty cool. So, stay tuned. So what
- [06:43] you'll notice is if we come to
- [06:44] playground here, we can check our tool
- [06:46] set of YouTube scraper. Nice. With the
- [06:48] tool set selected here, you'll see all
- [06:50] the relevant stuff. So this is the
- [06:51] YouTube scraper which we grabbed here
- [06:54] from amplify. And then this is the
- [06:55] bumpups which we grabbed from the
- [06:57] bumpups documentation. So now we've
- [06:59] successfully created a self-hosted MCP
- [07:01] server that's going to be able to do any
- [07:03] of these actions we request. So let's
- [07:05] just do one real quick. I'm going to
- [07:06] make sure I select the environment of
- [07:07] YouTube data that we set. I'm going to
- [07:09] say use bump up create chat and ask what
- [07:12] is the best part of this video and the
- [07:14] video we'll use is from speak easy
- [07:16] introducing Graham. So what you'll
- [07:18] notice here is going to do the relevant
- [07:19] call. Nice. We're going to hit accept.
- [07:20] I'm posting the data. I'm sending the
- [07:22] data and there we go based on the video
- [07:25] which was introducing the Graham
- [07:26] platform. As you can see here with the
- [07:28] video and this title introducing Graham
- [07:30] build agent tools that perform we get
- [07:31] the highlights of upload a spec create a
- [07:34] curated MCP tools and host in one click.
- [07:36] So kind and a deja vu as you're seeing
- [07:38] it live right now as well. Point being
- [07:40] though, now you can see functionally how
- [07:41] we test the different API actions that
- [07:43] we built in our MCP server. So in theory
- [07:45] here, I could test ones from YouTube
- [07:46] scraper as well, but I'm going to create
- [07:47] a custom tool later on in this video to
- [07:49] show you how we can kind of match and
- [07:51] pair these, which will lead back nicely
- [07:53] to what you saw in the beginning of the
- [07:55] video where we can actually connect all
- [07:56] these different APIs and do really cool
- [07:58] actions with them all automatically and
- [08:00] let AI do the heavy lifting. But let's
- [08:02] first off jump over to the MCP server,
- [08:04] right? So we go to MCP here. Click it.
- [08:06] What does all of this mean? Well, first
- [08:08] off, this is your link here, right? So,
- [08:10] you got Web Cafe AI, YouTube grab. We're
- [08:12] going to reference this when we do our
- [08:14] cursor integration together. Coming down
- [08:16] here, we got visibility. Do you want it
- [08:18] to be a publicly available URL? Eg,
- [08:20] anyone can access this MCP or
- [08:22] alternatively, do you want this as an
- [08:23] internal facing tool, so keep it a
- [08:25] private? Now, let's get to the fun stuff
- [08:26] here with the MCP installation and
- [08:27] actually start using this outside of
- [08:29] this environment. Let's go over here to
- [08:32] view. We're going to go ahead and click
- [08:33] view. What Graham does out of the box,
- [08:35] which is super cool, is that it shows
- [08:37] you all these like easy plug-and-play
- [08:39] ways to install across all these
- [08:40] different platforms. Alternatively, if
- [08:42] you want to install this MCP maybe into
- [08:44] something that isn't shown above there,
- [08:45] we can do it with this raw
- [08:47] configuration. But I'm going to show you
- [08:48] today how to do it within cursor. And
- [08:50] then once I show you it working in
- [08:51] cursor, we're going to create a custom
- [08:52] tool together for a very specific action
- [08:54] we can actually leverage in cursor AI
- [08:56] that will help us out when we're coding.
- [08:58] So to add a cursor, we're going to
- [08:59] simply go to add client. We can click
- [09:01] cursor here or alternatively click it
- [09:03] here. Once we add it, what's nice is it
- [09:04] will automatically go here. We can name
- [09:06] it. So we'll just call it YouTube
- [09:07] scraper. That's fine. It has all the
- [09:09] information already put here. But the
- [09:11] only thing that's needed from us as of
- [09:12] now is going to be this last part here
- [09:14] of MCP bumpups API. So we're going to
- [09:16] put this value here. Remember this is
- [09:18] the key Z key install. Now let me go
- [09:21] ahead and help you out real quick just
- [09:22] in case you run into some errors on this
- [09:23] part. First off, if you run into an
- [09:25] error right away, it's like it's not
- [09:26] working. Hit this pencil icon. You want
- [09:28] to ensure a couple things. First off,
- [09:29] these are environment variables. Nice.
- [09:31] We put that in together. Second off,
- [09:33] this line right here, line seven.
- [09:35] Fundamentally extremely important that
- [09:38] this URL is the URL you see here of
- [09:41] hosted URL. It's this one right here. So
- [09:43] you copy this and paste it here. Then it
- [09:46] should work. Next, what you'll notice is
- [09:48] that we have all nine tools enabled. I
- [09:50] can click this and maybe we only want
- [09:52] the chat feature. So we do this, this,
- [09:54] this, this. You know, we want the get
- [09:56] data. That's nice. And then after that,
- [09:59] we only have two tools enabled. Eg the
- [10:01] create chat and the scraping of the
- [10:04] YouTube data. Creating a chat allows us
- [10:06] to ask any type of prompt to get
- [10:07] information on that YouTube video. And
- [10:08] the scraping of the data allows us to
- [10:10] get metadata like the title, duration,
- [10:12] everything of this nature. Now, before
- [10:14] we see it in action, I want to show you
- [10:15] one really cool thing that is an extra
- [10:17] layer of specialization you can do with
- [10:20] your MCP servers. If I come up here to
- [10:22] tool set again, I go to the tool set of
- [10:24] YouTube scraper which you remember we
- [10:26] set up earlier. I can go to any of these
- [10:28] actions and give the context more AI of
- [10:30] how to handle the relevant data. So for
- [10:32] example, create chat. If I hit edit here
- [10:35] and I go to edit description. This is
- [10:36] the description. But this isn't just a
- [10:39] you know front-facing description. This
- [10:41] description it can actually be read by
- [10:42] the AI model. Provide the video URL and
- [10:44] an optimal prompt. If no prompt is
- [10:46] provided, the API returns a summary of
- [10:49] the video content. In theory here, you
- [10:51] can add more brand guidelines or just
- [10:55] more rules. So, like for example, if I
- [10:57] wanted the responses to be more brief
- [10:59] when it comes to using this specific
- [11:00] tool, I would put all responses should
- [11:02] be under four sentences and hit save.
- [11:05] There's a lot more nuance here. So, I'm
- [11:06] going to go ahead and also leave the
- [11:07] docs to Graham in the description down
- [11:09] below. So, you can kind of search
- [11:10] through here. Also, what's really nice
- [11:11] about these docs, I love it. You go to
- [11:13] search here, you can use the AI and
- [11:16] essentially just find the exact
- [11:17] information you're looking for. Gone are
- [11:18] the days of command F or control F on
- [11:20] your browser. Ask AI. Let's go to see it
- [11:23] in action, though. So, here is our
- [11:25] prompt. I need to learn more about this
- [11:26] video. Provide the video link. This is
- [11:27] about GitHub in 10 minutes. Use the MCP
- [11:30] server YouTube scraper that we've
- [11:31] identified here. Tool bumpups chat and
- [11:33] ask what is the most important idea to
- [11:34] remember from this tutorial. And use the
- [11:36] YouTube scraper get data for the
- [11:37] metadata on the video. Now, what I'm
- [11:38] going to show you pretty soon here is
- [11:39] how we can actually cause a chain
- [11:40] reaction and really leverage this MCP to
- [11:43] its maxability with custom tools using
- [11:46] Graham. But for now, let's see it
- [11:48] functionally work. Enter. One thing
- [11:49] that's important is make sure you enable
- [11:51] agent mode. How to reset this chat. But
- [11:53] agent mode is gonna allow us to actually
- [11:55] leverage these MCP server. There we go.
- [11:56] We're running the bumpups create chat.
- [11:58] Nice. It was able to run the YouTube
- [12:00] scrape data MCP protocol as well. And
- [12:02] here we go. So we got the metadata how
- [12:04] to use GitHub for beginners. Nice. And
- [12:06] then we got the most important idea.
- [12:08] Treat the main branch as a stable source
- [12:09] of truth and use branches and pull
- [12:11] requests to make test and merge changes
- [12:13] safely. This is true. Don't ever mess
- [12:15] with the main branch that's in
- [12:16] production. No good. That's just one
- [12:18] small example of what we could do in
- [12:20] cursor AI. In theory, I could load a
- [12:22] bunch of coding tutorials using YouTube
- [12:24] links. Now, provide all that context
- [12:26] using Graham MCP and grabbing the data
- [12:28] that way, putting it into my chat, and
- [12:29] then whenever I'm coding out, the code
- [12:31] would be better because cursor has more
- [12:33] context. But let me show you something
- [12:34] that I think a lot of y'all are going to
- [12:36] like. And this is called custom tools.
- [12:38] So, we're say create new custom tool.
- [12:40] We're going to use the tool set that we
- [12:42] created, YouTube scraper. And all we do
- [12:44] here is just use regular dictation just
- [12:45] like we're talking to an AI model. I
- [12:47] want you to scrape the YouTube link I
- [12:49] provide and output the metadata of the
- [12:50] video. What specific action do you want
- [12:52] it to do first? Then use pop-up chat to
- [12:56] ask for a summary of the video. We just
- [12:57] paired two different APIs from two
- [12:59] different providers and we can make them
- [13:01] work hand in hand. Toolify. So now
- [13:04] within the MCP, we don't have to call
- [13:06] each one separately. Rather we have a
- [13:08] new tool. I can rename this YouTube.
- [13:12] Yes. And what YouTube yes does and when
- [13:14] I call it functionally in any
- [13:16] application I use is going to do both
- [13:18] those APIs in tangent. And to test this,
- [13:21] we simply hit try now. It's going to
- [13:23] want the YouTube link. So I'm going to
- [13:24] paste it and boom. We were able to get
- [13:27] the relevant YouTube video metadata and
- [13:29] on top of that the relevant summary from
- [13:31] Bumpup's chat. Now fundamentally you
- [13:33] just learned that you can actually do a
- [13:35] chain effect by using custom tools here
- [13:38] where you can pair all these different
- [13:39] APIs together. Therefore, an action you
- [13:42] do with Instagram scraper could pair
- [13:43] with Tik Tok scraper. All done in one
- [13:46] command you make in your custom MCP. So,
- [13:48] that just about does today's video. Let
- [13:50] me know what kind of MCP you plan on
- [13:51] creating. Graham is pretty intuitive,
- [13:53] y'all. It has support for a bunch of
- [13:54] different languages such as Python,
- [13:56] TypeScript, Java, whatever you like to
- [13:58] program in, it can handle. So, go ahead
- [14:00] and check out Graham. It's in the
- [14:01] description down below. And as you
- [14:02] already know with these style of videos,
- [14:04] I'll see you in the next. Can we now
- [14:06] just create a custom MCP server that can
- [14:08] do whatever we want? Change actions and
- [14:09] do anything that you could ever think
- [14:10] of. Video Graham speak easy.
