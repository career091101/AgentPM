## Text

- [00:00] I get asked this question more than
- [00:02] anything, so it is about time that I
- [00:04] make a video covering this. Should I be
- [00:06] building my AI agents with N8N or
- [00:09] Python? Or more generally, should I
- [00:11] build my agents with no code tools or in
- [00:14] code? If I had a dime for every time
- [00:17] someone asked me this, Elon Musk would
- [00:18] wish he had my net worth. And so my goal
- [00:21] in this video for you, just very
- [00:23] broadly, is to make it easy for you to
- [00:25] make a decision use case by use case.
- [00:28] Should I stick to N8N as the easy way to
- [00:30] build AI agents or move to code, get
- [00:33] over that learning curve and probably
- [00:34] learn how to leverage AI coding
- [00:36] assistance as well? And all the pros and
- [00:38] cons that I have here in this beautiful
- [00:40] diagram that'll guide our video today, I
- [00:43] honestly don't think that any of them
- [00:45] are hot takes. But of course, there are
- [00:47] always nuances that you might think of
- [00:49] as we go over this. And so definitely
- [00:50] let me know in the comments if you agree
- [00:52] with everything that I'm saying here or
- [00:54] if you think that there's something that
- [00:56] I've missed. And before I go and say
- [00:57] anything positive or negative about
- [00:59] either, I just want to be super clear
- [01:01] that I have a deep level of respect for
- [01:03] building AI agents both with N8N and
- [01:06] Python and all the AI agent frameworks
- [01:08] that we have there. In fact, at the end
- [01:10] of the video, there is something else
- [01:11] that I want you to consider. We don't
- [01:13] necessarily have to pick one over the
- [01:16] other. More on that later. But right
- [01:18] now, I want to explain my general
- [01:21] recommendation and then get into the
- [01:23] pros and cons to really help you think
- [01:25] for yourself how what I'm saying applies
- [01:26] to your use case. And so, at a high
- [01:29] level, I recommend using N8N to build
- [01:32] your AI agents for any kind of
- [01:34] integrationheavy internal tools, proof
- [01:36] of concepts, and team collaboration
- [01:38] across skill levels. So, N8N is a very
- [01:41] integrationheavy platform. You can
- [01:43] connect to hundreds of different
- [01:44] services so easily. And so any kind of
- [01:47] internal automations you have for your
- [01:48] team, N8 is great for that. And then
- [01:50] proof of concepts simply because you can
- [01:52] build so quickly with N8N. And then
- [01:55] across different skill levels because
- [01:57] there is a lot less of a learning curve
- [01:59] building your agents and automations in
- [02:00] N8N versus in Python. Now, when you
- [02:04] really want to get to production scale
- [02:06] applications or anything where speed,
- [02:09] control, and flexibility, like how much
- [02:11] can you really design the solution
- [02:12] around exactly what you want, that is
- [02:15] when I recommend going with Python. I
- [02:17] know a lot of people that start with N8N
- [02:19] because it's easier and then they move
- [02:21] to Python when they really want to take
- [02:22] their ideas far. Not saying that you
- [02:25] can't do the same with N8N, but that's
- [02:26] just generally what I see. And I do use
- [02:29] both as a part of my workflow still
- [02:31] because I'll use nitn to prototype so I
- [02:33] can ideulate quickly and then move to
- [02:35] Python when I really want to scale
- [02:37] things and have a lot of the flexibility
- [02:38] that I'll be talking about throughout
- [02:40] this video. And so with that, I want to
- [02:43] move on to the pros and cons here. I
- [02:45] love my pros and cons list and I made it
- [02:48] look all nice and pretty for you as
- [02:49] well. And so I want to start with N8N,
- [02:51] talk about the good and the bad there
- [02:53] and then how that relates to Python. And
- [02:55] by the way, when I say N8N versus
- [02:57] Python, I mean more generally no code
- [02:59] versus code, these are just the two
- [03:01] tools that I use extensively myself and
- [03:03] what I cover on my YouTube channel. So
- [03:05] starting with N8N, it is both very easy
- [03:08] to get started. The learning curve is
- [03:10] quite small and it is a beautifully
- [03:13] visual agent builder. So I've got a
- [03:15] workflow up just as an example to talk
- [03:17] about here. When I'm building with N8N,
- [03:19] it feels like I have this canvas. It's
- [03:22] like an art form to create my AI agents
- [03:25] and automations. I just love how easy it
- [03:27] is to connect my different nodes
- [03:29] together. I can visualize the tools I
- [03:30] have connected to my agent, for example.
- [03:32] You definitely don't have this kind of
- [03:35] experience when you're working with code
- [03:37] instead. And of course, you've got your
- [03:40] hundreds of integrations and thousands
- [03:41] of templates to help you get started.
- [03:43] One of the things that N8N makes so easy
- [03:46] is integrating with your different
- [03:47] services like my database with Postgress
- [03:50] or Google Drive. I just go in here. I
- [03:52] can pick from the hundreds of different
- [03:54] integrations that we have. And then it
- [03:56] walks me through setting up my
- [03:57] credentials. And then boom, I'm good to
- [03:59] go for each service in just a couple of
- [04:01] minutes. And it's not that easy to do
- [04:03] with code. A lot of times you find
- [04:05] yourself rebuilding the same
- [04:06] integrations that other people have
- [04:08] thousands of times because it isn't just
- [04:10] a node you can drag into your workflow.
- [04:12] And speaking of leaning on other people,
- [04:14] there's also thousands of templates for
- [04:17] us to use in the N template library. No
- [04:19] matter what you want to build or the
- [04:21] service you want to integrate with
- [04:22] specifically, you'll probably find
- [04:24] something here to help you get started
- [04:25] so you don't have to start anything from
- [04:27] scratch. And that's part of what I do
- [04:29] with my YouTube channel as well is
- [04:30] sharing these templates like this one
- [04:32] for an Aentic rag agent with knowledge
- [04:34] graphs so that you have a place to start
- [04:36] from. This isn't the end goal, but this
- [04:38] is a template for you to build on top of
- [04:40] and customize to your use case. And so
- [04:42] there's a lot of things out there to
- [04:44] help us do that with N8N. And also for a
- [04:47] noode platform, N8N scales extremely
- [04:51] well because of something called Q mode.
- [04:53] That's definitely more advanced. I'm not
- [04:54] going to cover that in this video
- [04:56] extensively obviously, but like for a
- [04:58] noode platform, N8N scales to thousands
- [05:01] of users quite well. And also, I
- [05:04] definitely have to call out that N8N is
- [05:07] open- source and self-hostable, which
- [05:09] also means we can build our AI agents to
- [05:11] run completely locally if we're working
- [05:12] with sensitive data or just want a very
- [05:15] secure environment. And so, I have
- [05:17] always appreciate N8N a lot for that.
- [05:19] So, a lot of high praise for N8N. It
- [05:21] really is an incredible platform, but
- [05:23] there are unfortunately some cons that
- [05:25] we have to cover here. First of all, N8N
- [05:28] is 100% open- source and self-hostable,
- [05:31] but that doesn't mean that it's free for
- [05:33] you to commercialize your workflows. You
- [05:35] have to pay a license fee. Now, I'm not
- [05:38] going to do a cost breakdown right now,
- [05:40] but definitely go research that if it
- [05:42] applies to you. Just know that this is a
- [05:44] big reason that I use N8N for internal
- [05:47] tools and proof of concepts because I'm
- [05:49] not commercializing either of those.
- [05:51] Also with N8N we hit what I call the
- [05:54] noode performance and noode integration
- [05:57] box. So for performance there is an
- [06:00] overhead for these noode platforms with
- [06:03] these node builders. They're never going
- [06:05] to be as efficient as directly running
- [06:08] code. Even with a language like Python
- [06:10] that is generally considered to be one
- [06:12] of the slower languages, it still has a
- [06:14] lot better efficiency compared to N8N.
- [06:18] And then what I mean by the integration
- [06:19] box is we are boxed in to the
- [06:23] integrations that N8N supplies us. And
- [06:25] sure, it's pretty fantastic how many
- [06:28] there are overall, but it's going to get
- [06:30] to that point where you find that one
- [06:32] tool that you really want to use, but
- [06:34] it's not there in the integration list.
- [06:36] And so you have to build the integration
- [06:38] yourself, typically with an HTTP request
- [06:40] node. But that gets more complex. And
- [06:43] often times, especially because of AI
- [06:44] coding assistance, at that point it's
- [06:46] easier to just code the solution. And
- [06:48] even for the integrations that are there
- [06:51] for you, they don't always have what you
- [06:53] need. One good example is Google Drive.
- [06:56] We're able to watch for files that are
- [06:58] created or updated in a Google Drive
- [07:00] folder, but not for files that are
- [07:02] deleted. And for something like a rag
- [07:04] pipeline where we need to keep our
- [07:05] knowledge base in sync with Google
- [07:07] Drive, that's actually pretty important.
- [07:09] And so this is a good example where I
- [07:11] had to build this workflow with a direct
- [07:13] integration using the HTTP node to the
- [07:15] Google Drive API to watch for files that
- [07:17] are deleted and I have to do so
- [07:20] periodically. It's not an ideal
- [07:21] solution, but that's what I was forced
- [07:23] to do with N8N. And kind of going along
- [07:26] the same lines here, when you can't do
- [07:28] something in N8N, a lot of times you'll
- [07:30] resort to using code nodes, which don't
- [07:33] get me wrong, it's fantastic that N8N
- [07:36] gives this to us. So we can inject code
- [07:38] anywhere in our workflows when we need
- [07:40] some more customizability, but these
- [07:42] code nodes are not very efficient. And
- [07:45] because of security reasons, you're very
- [07:47] limited to the libraries that you can
- [07:49] import into the JavaScript or Python
- [07:52] code nodes. And so they're fantastic.
- [07:54] They solve the problem they aim to
- [07:56] solve, but they're never going to be
- [07:58] ideal. And I see these workflows all the
- [08:00] time where they end up just being half
- [08:02] code now. And it's like, come on, man.
- [08:03] Why don't you just code the solution in
- [08:05] the first place? Also, end workflows are
- [08:08] difficult to version control. One of the
- [08:10] beautiful things that we have with code
- [08:12] is we can track the changes in our files
- [08:15] over time and even revert things when
- [08:17] the things go wrong. And that's all
- [08:19] thanks to git. Now, we can just throw
- [08:21] the JSON workflows for N8N in our Git
- [08:25] repository, but JSON diffs are pretty
- [08:29] ugly. Not to get too technical here.
- [08:30] It's actually quite difficult to really
- [08:32] see what has changed in your workflow
- [08:34] over time, and it's kind of unal because
- [08:36] you have to translate things between Git
- [08:38] and then like bringing it back into
- [08:40] GitHub when you want to revert something
- [08:41] or see what you had in a previous
- [08:43] version. And then last but not least,
- [08:45] N8N does not work very well for large
- [08:47] files, which is especially important for
- [08:49] your RAG AI agents. I have had N8N
- [08:53] choke, even with 20 megabyte PDF files,
- [08:56] bringing it through something like a RAG
- [08:58] pipeline. And that's even if my machine
- [09:02] hosting NAN definitely has enough memory
- [09:04] because there's a separate problem with
- [09:06] node buffering. And generally what I've
- [09:09] seen in the nan community is especially
- [09:11] once you get to 200 megabytes for your
- [09:13] files nan is going to choke so bad and
- [09:15] you can handle tens hundreds of
- [09:18] gigabytes easily in your Python code as
- [09:20] long as you have the memory in your
- [09:22] machine to handle that. So that's nan at
- [09:24] a high level. There are definitely cons
- [09:26] to code as well. So I want to cover that
- [09:28] too. So moving over to code now I'm
- [09:30] going to start with the cons with Python
- [09:32] here. First of all, we obviously have a
- [09:35] higher learning curve. Even with the
- [09:37] help of AI coding assistance, which I
- [09:39] cover so much on my channel nowadays,
- [09:42] you still need to validate the code. And
- [09:45] so, it's important for you to understand
- [09:47] Python or really whatever language or AI
- [09:49] agent framework you're working with. And
- [09:51] so, it does take more to get yourself
- [09:53] comfortable. And also, there is a higher
- [09:57] chance of security issues. You need to
- [09:59] know your stuff more. So, kind of
- [10:01] related to the higher learning curve,
- [10:02] but security I wanted to call out
- [10:04] specifically because there's a lot that
- [10:05] NAN handles for us with security because
- [10:08] they manage the credentials. They help
- [10:10] us set up the credentials like I showed
- [10:12] earlier and so you have to worry about
- [10:13] that less. Also, one of the biggest
- [10:16] things with N8N is they give us the
- [10:18] integrations ahead of time. We don't
- [10:20] have to set up things oursel unless
- [10:22] we're hitting the integration box. With
- [10:24] code, that's different. Even if there
- [10:27] are a million developers that have
- [10:29] already set up a Google Drive
- [10:30] integration, a lot of times you'll find
- [10:32] yourself rebuilding it from scratch
- [10:34] because there's no clear here's your
- [10:36] node to dump into your workflow like we
- [10:38] have with N8N. And then last but not
- [10:40] least, code can often be very difficult
- [10:43] to visualize. There are some tools to
- [10:46] help this. For example, when I'm
- [10:48] building my AI agents with Langraph, I
- [10:50] have the Lang graph studio. So I can see
- [10:52] for my multi- aent workflows, for
- [10:54] example, here are the different agents
- [10:56] that I have. Here's my guard rail.
- [10:58] Here's my fallback. And I can see what
- [11:00] my workflow looks like even as I execute
- [11:03] it. And you have tools like Langfuse for
- [11:05] tracing. So you can get a lot of
- [11:08] visibility and sort of a visualization
- [11:10] into what is going on, but it's never
- [11:12] going to be as much of that canvas like
- [11:15] we have with N8N. So definitely there is
- [11:18] the advantage to no code tools there.
- [11:20] But now we get into the pros of code.
- [11:23] And this is where I think you'll really
- [11:24] start to see why people will start with
- [11:27] N8N but then move to Python for a lot of
- [11:30] things. As much as both are fantastic
- [11:32] because Python is where you have full
- [11:35] control and customizability.
- [11:37] There are limitations you'll hit with no
- [11:39] code tools where there's just nothing
- [11:40] you can do because when you have the
- [11:43] code, that's when basically every
- [11:46] possibility is open to you. Just to give
- [11:48] one really quick example here in N.
- [11:51] There isn't actually the idea of
- [11:54] parallel execution. You can set up your
- [11:56] workflow in a way where it will run two
- [11:59] different things, but these will end up
- [12:02] running simultaneously. Even though the
- [12:03] workflow builder kind of makes it look
- [12:05] like they're going to run in parallel,
- [12:08] but in code, you can truly run things in
- [12:12] parallel. For example, one of the AI
- [12:14] agents that I build in the AI agent
- [12:16] mastery course in Dynamis is this
- [12:19] research agent that runs multiple
- [12:21] research agents in parallel. So, for
- [12:23] example, I can say I want to build an AI
- [12:26] pet startup. And so, this AI agent helps
- [12:29] me with competitor research. It helps me
- [12:31] analyze SEO and marketing. Take a look
- [12:34] at this. And it kicks off all of these
- [12:36] specialized research agents at exactly
- [12:38] the same time to help me with my
- [12:40] request. And you can't do this in NAND.
- [12:44] It's just not possible. But with Python
- [12:46] and any programming language, we're able
- [12:48] to do parallel execution. So, not only
- [12:50] is it faster because the language itself
- [12:52] is faster than no code tool, but also
- [12:54] we're able to do things like parallel
- [12:56] execution. Also, token streaming like
- [12:58] you're seeing right here is another
- [13:00] thing we can't do in N8N. So, just
- [13:02] showing you a really good example of a
- [13:03] couple of random things. You'll see this
- [13:05] quite a bit where we have a better user
- [13:08] experience, a better speed thanks to
- [13:10] everything being in code. And going
- [13:12] back, we got the better performance kind
- [13:14] of like I've already covered. Also,
- [13:16] access to top open-source AI tools and
- [13:18] libraries. All these things that I've
- [13:20] covered on my channel like graffiti for
- [13:22] knowledge graphs, dockling for rag. We
- [13:25] have crawl for AI for crawling websites.
- [13:28] You can integrate these things with NN
- [13:30] and I've shown some of that with like
- [13:31] crawl for AI and graffiti for example,
- [13:33] but it's a lot more difficult. It's not
- [13:35] as simple as installing a Python
- [13:37] package, setting up your environment
- [13:39] variable, and then boom, you're good to
- [13:40] go. And then the big thing that I
- [13:42] mentioned a couple of times already is
- [13:44] being able to use AI coding assistance
- [13:46] because they are getting so powerful,
- [13:49] especially tools like Codeex and Claude
- [13:51] Code. Right now, you can build things so
- [13:54] quickly that part of the advantage of
- [13:56] N8N being easier to build things. That's
- [13:59] starting to diminish just thanks to AI
- [14:01] coding assistance. Also, code is always
- [14:04] going to scale better even though Q mode
- [14:07] is really nice for N8N. We can also run
- [14:09] our agents locally. So, everything can
- [14:12] be open source with Python assuming
- [14:14] you're using the right tools. But then
- [14:15] also there's no license concerns also
- [14:18] assuming you are using the right tools.
- [14:20] And then of course we've got version
- [14:21] control with Git. So it's just a lot
- [14:23] easier to manage our different
- [14:25] environments, having backups and being
- [14:27] able to revert to different versions of
- [14:29] our code, the kinds of things that it's
- [14:31] just not as realistic with our no code
- [14:34] tools. So there you go. That was a lot
- [14:36] of detail on the pros and cons of both,
- [14:39] but I wanted to be very specific for you
- [14:41] so that you can take what I said here.
- [14:44] Think for yourself how it applies to
- [14:46] your own use cases. Make the decision
- [14:48] for you. And the last thing that I'll
- [14:51] leave you with to consider is the hybrid
- [14:54] approach. You don't have to just pick
- [14:57] N8N or just pick Python. You can for
- [15:00] example use N8N for the orchestration
- [15:02] all of the entry points and integrations
- [15:04] for your applications but then offload
- [15:06] the heavy processing like your agents
- [15:09] chunking for rag the data set handling
- [15:11] for those larger files you can give that
- [15:13] all to external Python microservices and
- [15:15] even deploy both of the things together
- [15:18] Python and N8N on the same instance in
- [15:20] the cloud and I've even shown that on my
- [15:22] channel before like with my graffiti MCP
- [15:25] server video for example because then
- [15:27] you can take advantage of the pros and
- [15:29] cons of both platforms, using them
- [15:31] together, relying on their strengths.
- [15:34] So, I hope this video has been very
- [15:36] helpful for you to help you make that
- [15:38] allimportant decision that will apply no
- [15:40] matter what you are building. And of
- [15:42] course, let me know in the comments if
- [15:43] you agree with what I'm covering here or
- [15:45] if you think there are some nuances that
- [15:47] I should be covering or anything that
- [15:48] I've missed. And with that, if you
- [15:51] appreciated this video and you're
- [15:52] looking forward to more things on AI
- [15:54] agents, I would really appreciate a like
- [15:55] and a subscribe. And with that, I will
- [15:57] see you in the next
