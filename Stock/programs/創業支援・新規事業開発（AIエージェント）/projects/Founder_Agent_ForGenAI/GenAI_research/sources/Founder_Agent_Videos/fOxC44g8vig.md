- [00:00] Hi, my name is Otto and in this video
- [00:02] we're going to discuss agent skills.
- [00:05] Agents today are pretty intelligent, but
- [00:07] they don't always have the domain
- [00:09] expertise you need for real work and
- [00:11] skills help solve this. You can think of
- [00:13] skills as organized folders that package
- [00:16] expertise that Cloud can automatically
- [00:18] invoke when relevant to the task at
- [00:20] hand. And most importantly, these skills
- [00:22] are portable across cloud code, the API
- [00:25] as well as cla.ai. And the way skills
- [00:27] work is at startup only the name and
- [00:30] description of every installed skill is
- [00:32] loaded in the system prompt. This is
- [00:34] going to consume about 30 to 50 tokens
- [00:36] per skill and make Claude aware of the
- [00:39] skill's existence. Then when a user
- [00:41] prompt matches a skills description,
- [00:43] Claude is going to dynamically load the
- [00:46] full skill.md file into context. And
- [00:49] finally, if the skill references other
- [00:51] files or scripts, they are also
- [00:53] progressively loaded and run as needed.
- [00:55] This progressive disclosure allows you
- [00:57] to install many different skills to
- [00:59] perform complex tasks without bloating
- [01:01] your context window. But let's see how
- [01:03] skills fit in with the other Claude
- [01:06] features. While skills teach Claude how
- [01:08] to do specialized tasks, Claude.md files
- [01:11] tell Claude about the specific project.
- [01:13] Things like your text stack, coding
- [01:15] conventions, and repo structure. CloudMD
- [01:18] files live alongside your code in the
- [01:20] repository. A CloudMD file may say
- [01:23] things like we [music] use Nex.js JS and
- [01:25] Tailwind. But skills on the other hand
- [01:27] are portable expertise that work across
- [01:29] any project. So a front-end design skill
- [01:32] can teach Claude your typography
- [01:34] standards, animation patterns, and
- [01:36] layout conventions and [music] activate
- [01:38] automatically when building UI
- [01:40] components. MCP servers on the other
- [01:42] hand provide universal integration, a
- [01:44] single protocol that connects Claude to
- [01:46] external context sources like GitHub,
- [01:48] linear, Postgress, and many many others.
- [01:51] MCP connects to data. Skills teach
- [01:54] Claude what to do with it. So an MCP
- [01:56] server may give Claude access to your
- [01:58] database, but a database query skill can
- [02:01] teach Claude your team's query
- [02:03] optimization patterns. Finally, sub
- [02:05] agents are specialized AI assistants
- [02:08] with fixed roles. Each sub agent has its
- [02:10] own context window, custom prompt, and
- [02:12] specific tool permissions. skills
- [02:15] provide portable expertise that any
- [02:16] agent can use. So your front-end
- [02:19] developer sub agent can use a component
- [02:22] pattern skill. Your UI reviewer sub
- [02:24] agent on the other hand can use a design
- [02:26] system skill, but both can load and use
- [02:28] the same accessibility standard skill.
- [02:31] And the best part is these capabilities
- [02:33] are designed to work together. Your
- [02:35] cloudMD file sets the foundation. MCP
- [02:38] [music] servers connect the data. Sub
- [02:40] agents specialize in their roles and
- [02:42] skills bring the expertise making every
- [02:44] piece smarter and more capable. At the
- [02:47] end of the day, skills let you package
- [02:49] workflows into reusable capabilities
- [02:51] like helping onboard new hires to your
- [02:53] team's coding standards, ensuring every
- [02:55] PR follows a specific security best
- [02:58] practices or sharing your data analysis
- [03:00] methodology across your team. And that's
- [03:02] how skills can help you achieve more
- [03:04] with Claude. We encourage you to give
- [03:06] them a try and see how they can improve
- [03:08] your workflows.
