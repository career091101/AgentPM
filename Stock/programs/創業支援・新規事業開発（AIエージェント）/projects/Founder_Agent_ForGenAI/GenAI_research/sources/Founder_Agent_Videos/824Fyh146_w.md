- [00:03] so I've been playing with this new AI ID
- [00:05] called Wier for the past few days even
- [00:07] though it's looks familiar like any
- [00:09] other e IDE it does feel very different
- [00:11] when you actually use it one of the key
- [00:13] things that wi serve doing particularly
- [00:15] well is the context awareness if you
- [00:17] ever use cursor to implement some
- [00:18] feature to existing puras one thing you
- [00:21] will quickly realize is that cursor
- [00:23] often didn't really understand the
- [00:24] project structure very well even though
- [00:26] you set up project and ask it to build
- [00:28] app it often has noide IDE about what
- [00:30] type of project it is and where it
- [00:32] should create the right project file not
- [00:34] to mention if you want to ask cursor to
- [00:36] add a new feature to your existing cbase
- [00:38] it almost guaranteed fail because you
- [00:40] generally didn't really understand the
- [00:42] dependencies of different files so how
- [00:44] is a wind serve going to be different so
- [00:46] this a wi Ser interface it looks pretty
- [00:48] familiar like any other Aid you can
- [00:51] build any files try to do things like
- [00:53] autocomplete but what's really magic is
- [00:55] this Cascade feature so Cascade to some
- [00:57] extent you can consider that as like
- [00:59] cursor composer it is Agent that can
- [01:01] create files run commands and understand
- [01:03] your project structures and it might
- [01:05] look similar to any other chatwi code
- [01:07] based interface but once you try it it
- [01:10] does feel a little bit different as it
- [01:11] is really aware of the whole project
- [01:14] structure the environment it is in much
- [01:16] better as a quick example I have this
- [01:17] nextjs project already set up with
- [01:20] certain file structures I can just
- [01:22] prompt wind serve cc to build out the
- [01:24] web app and without prompting at the
- [01:26] current file structure it will be able
- [01:28] to create file in the right places for
- [01:30] example if I wanted to create a basic
- [01:32] text to image platform I can just take a
- [01:35] documentation from flux model that is
- [01:37] hosted on replicate copy paste whole dog
- [01:39] directly and then add a simple prompt
- [01:41] above is a text to image AI model posted
- [01:44] on replicate help me turn it into a web
- [01:46] app using nextjs and chassin I already
- [01:49] set up a project in my app folder and
- [01:51] you will see that before you implement
- [01:53] any code it will firstly try to analyze
- [01:55] your project structure to understand
- [01:57] where to create which files it identify
- [01:59] the the nextjs project and chassin
- [02:02] components already set up and next it
- [02:04] will also show this UI ask me for
- [02:06] approval to run certain terminal
- [02:08] commands so it is able to actually run
- [02:10] command directly if I click accept it
- [02:13] will run command and get a result if
- [02:15] there's no Arrow it will continue but
- [02:17] you can imagine if the command line
- [02:19] return arrow it will also be able to
- [02:21] self reflect and fix issue if you check
- [02:24] the project folder on the left
- [02:26] everything has been created in the right
- [02:28] place as expected and you will know that
- [02:29] there's a components folder already so
- [02:31] all the new components will go under
- [02:33] that folder and if we open this app it
- [02:35] is also running too and apart from this
- [02:38] Pur structure it actually keep track and
- [02:41] understand all the change that human is
- [02:43] making alongside the AI for example I
- [02:45] can go to this component and change the
- [02:48] name of this function to be text to
- [02:50] image form instead and save this and
- [02:54] obviously this will cause error since
- [02:56] all the variable name is wrong but I can
- [02:58] actually just go to Cascade and and say
- [03:01] continue without giving any prompt it
- [03:04] actually understand and notice that the
- [03:06] component name has been changed from
- [03:08] image generated form to text to image
- [03:10] form then it start refactoring the whole
- [03:12] code base to making sure everything has
- [03:14] been updated and using the new name and
- [03:16] it also proposed update the file name to
- [03:19] reflect change as well so this was
- [03:21] really big H moment for me and that made
- [03:23] me realize why it is important to build
- [03:25] an IDE instead of just a visual studio
- [03:28] plug-in because now they can understand
- [03:30] so much better what the user is doing
- [03:33] and get a lot more contextual
- [03:34] information like the change they make
- [03:36] which file they are on at moment or even
- [03:39] have sandbox environment to get direct
- [03:40] feedback from the console and another
- [03:42] thing I experienced while I was using wi
- [03:44] serve is that there's one time I got bug
- [03:47] in the application that I'm trying to
- [03:48] build and they ask wi serve to fix it
- [03:51] then what I observe is that it actually
- [03:53] start reflect and iterate its own
- [03:55] solution so it generate a fix at
- [03:57] beginning and then later it said let me
- [04:00] try another approach since the previous
- [04:02] one might still have issues so it tried
- [04:04] another version but after that it tried
- [04:06] again it says let me try one Final
- [04:08] Approach that should work more reliably
- [04:11] and in the end it does fix issue so this
- [04:14] was really interesting cuz quite often
- [04:16] when I use other platform like cursor or
- [04:18] co-pilot while you're debugging many
- [04:20] times it feel like it is just running
- [04:22] circle and try to do the same thing
- [04:23] again and again and not fixing the issue
- [04:26] but this ability to actually reflect and
- [04:28] think about different ways it can solve
- [04:29] the problem can probably dramatically
- [04:31] improve the result and output though
- [04:33] it's a bit mystery to me about when this
- [04:35] will be triggered and how does it decide
- [04:37] there are actually still improvements
- [04:39] and iterations it should do but this
- [04:41] Behavior definitely feels very gantic
- [04:43] and smart so as I mentioned before even
- [04:44] though this Wing serve UI looks very
- [04:47] familiar behind things there a lot of
- [04:48] work seem goes into improve the code
- [04:50] quality as well as the contact awareness
- [04:53] and to understand why Wing serve is
- [04:55] doing so much better in terms of context
- [04:57] awareness I reach out to the codent and
- [04:59] Wing serve team to understand what their
- [05:01] secret Source are and they share a lot
- [05:03] of interesting source of how does Wing
- [05:05] serve actually work behind the scenes
- [05:07] but before I show you those insights
- [05:08] interview Clips I know many of you just
- [05:10] getting started learning how to code and
- [05:12] one question I got asked a lot is
- [05:14] whether it is still needed to learn
- [05:15] coding if so what does a road map
- [05:17] actually look like and that is why I
- [05:19] want to introduce you to this free ebook
- [05:22] did by Google's principal analytics lead
- [05:24] and data scientist Sunday scet where she
- [05:26] wrote down all the secret tips and
- [05:28] methologies that she used to learn
- [05:30] coding with platform like Chad gbt and
- [05:32] design a personalized learning role map
- [05:34] it cover all the fundamentals and basics
- [05:36] of coding like how do you choose the
- [05:38] right coding language to start with for
- [05:40] your purpose best practice prompt for
- [05:42] different coding scenario like debugging
- [05:44] and optimizing the code as well as
- [05:46] detailed road map of how to master
- [05:48] python in just four months with a
- [05:50] purpose build a custom gbt that contain
- [05:52] a lot of Learning Resource and detailed
- [05:54] video tutorial showcase step by step of
- [05:57] her workflow so I definitely recommend
- [05:59] you go go take a look if you just
- [06:01] getting started with your coding journey
- [06:02] I have put the link in the description
- [06:04] below for you to download for free and
- [06:06] thanks hops ball for sharing this
- [06:07] awesome material for free now let's get
- [06:09] back to Winger and here is the interview
- [06:11] Clips between me and Codi and founding
- [06:14] engineer Andro where he Shar a lot of
- [06:16] interesting learnings and thoughts about
- [06:18] how wi Ser is building this context
- [06:20] aware IDE the way I always kind of
- [06:22] explain casc is we've given the AI
- [06:24] access to three things right knowledge
- [06:26] tools and the human acction and I think
- [06:28] there was kind of research along each of
- [06:30] those three things that we realized that
- [06:32] we were at a depth within each that
- [06:34] combining them actually made sense to do
- [06:36] larger and larger tasks so on the
- [06:38] knowledge side we've been investing a
- [06:40] lot of time into building what we like
- [06:41] to call a context awareness engine right
- [06:43] systems that can truly actually take
- [06:46] large code bases as Parts them embed
- [06:48] them index them combine full repository
- [06:52] awareness with the code structure so
- [06:54] we've been spending a lot of time
- [06:55] building those systems that are
- [06:57] orthogonal from the llms themselves
- [06:59] that's one part of the codium story we
- [07:01] support over a thousand Enterprises
- [07:03] including a number of the Fortune 500
- [07:05] and the only way that we're truly able
- [07:06] to give a a company of that kind of
- [07:09] complexity of code is if we've done a
- [07:11] really good job at understanding their
- [07:12] code base that's the first access so
- [07:14] that there's kind of constant research
- [07:15] there that we've already all always been
- [07:17] doing be powering the codium extension
- [07:19] so far but then the tools and the human
- [07:22] actions part I think we're more recent
- [07:24] and I think that's when when things came
- [07:26] together on the tool side we we
- [07:28] recognized there were some like tools
- [07:29] like okay make an edit to a file or add
- [07:31] a file or GP or list a directory like
- [07:34] these were kind of obvious tools that we
- [07:36] wanted to give the AI I don't think
- [07:38] these are necessarily groundbreaking
- [07:41] kind of ideas but we'd also build other
- [07:45] tools as well and and one of them was
- [07:47] actually covered by the press a few
- [07:48] months ago um it was this idea that
- [07:51] embedding base retrieval had some
- [07:52] fundamental limitations right if you
- [07:54] have a lot of Code false positive rates
- [07:56] for embedding based retrieval simply
- [07:58] means that the number of false positives
- [08:00] increase and if you have a lot of
- [08:01] garbage coming in you have garbage
- [08:03] coming out and so we've come up with a
- [08:05] new way of actually leveraging compute
- [08:07] to actually massively parallelize a
- [08:10] bunch of llm running at once across a
- [08:12] large amount of compute to essentially
- [08:15] retrieve more relevant Snippets at a
- [08:17] much higher accuracy than any embedding
- [08:19] based method right if we if we just go
- [08:22] back to embedding based methods right
- [08:23] you're taking raw code Snippets you're
- [08:27] putting them into a lower dimensional
- [08:28] space um by definition you're losing
- [08:32] some of the Nuance of the original raw
- [08:33] text that's just part of it so pending
- [08:36] embedding BAS system there is a
- [08:38] fundamental limit to it on kind of the
- [08:40] accuracy and how low your false bitor
- [08:42] rates can get but what if you flip the
- [08:46] question a little what if you say okay
- [08:47] what if we can actually just instead of
- [08:49] doing embedding based search because you
- [08:51] do embedding based search because it's
- [08:52] fast what if we actually trained a
- [08:54] proprietary LM that was really good at
- [08:56] asking the simple question is this
- [08:59] snippet of code relevant to the query
- [09:02] that I'm asking it doesn't have to be a
- [09:03] very large model but it's like a purpose
- [09:05] build model that's really good at that
- [09:06] one question and then you take that
- [09:09] model you paraliz essentially thousands
- [09:13] of those calls across a ton of compute
- [09:15] for a really burst period of time then
- [09:18] essentially you can get a really much
- [09:20] more higher you know quality score on
- [09:23] the relevance of each code snippet to
- [09:26] the query at hand actually captures the
- [09:28] full Nuance of the raw Tex
- [09:29] and then we've essentially figured out
- [09:31] by using that as a signal and using that
- [09:32] as an ability to do search it is
- [09:35] significantly outperforms any embedding
- [09:37] based state of the art method possible
- [09:39] yes you're doing a trade-off of compute
- [09:42] but like we'll take that trade-off any
- [09:44] day if that actually means it it creates
- [09:45] significantly so was like some
- [09:47] breakthroughs there and then on the
- [09:48] human actions part I think it was just
- [09:50] really trying to figure out what's the
- [09:51] right granularity of like a trajectory
- [09:53] are we able to actually pick up on what
- [09:56] the developer editing or where the
- [09:58] developer going into the edit and how
- [10:00] they're navigating a directory or doing
- [10:02] commands in the terminal and
- [10:04] understanding the granularity that was
- [10:05] required there to really get a true
- [10:07] picture of what a developer was doing at
- [10:09] all times and I think that was the third
- [10:11] reason and that was the most recent one
- [10:13] where it's like okay we really do want
- [10:14] access and control over the editor
- [10:17] because we want to see what a developer
- [10:18] is doing because if we can understand
- [10:20] what the developer is doing we have a
- [10:21] much much better chance of understanding
- [10:23] what their intent is and then they
- [10:25] therefore giving them relevant results
- [10:27] so there's a lot of can't say it was
- [10:29] just like ah yes we had one magic bullet
- [10:32] that unlocked everything right it's like
- [10:34] multiple years of of actual work that
- [10:35] came together um that made it really
- [10:37] clear that if we just developed our own
- [10:40] surface our own ux or our own IDE we
- [10:42] could expose this in a pretty magical
- [10:43] way and to best demonstrate how can you
- [10:45] get the most out of wing surf let's
- [10:47] build a real application together and
- [10:49] while I was looking for use case to
- [10:51] build I saw this tweet from Greg
- [10:52] Eisenberg where this a micro set called
- [10:55] bank statement converter basically just
- [10:57] do one thing taking the PDF and convert
- [10:59] them into Excel but this simple
- [11:01] application itself is generating more
- [11:03] than 30k Revenue per month and this is
- [11:05] really interesting because extract
- [11:06] structure data from PDFs is a job that
- [11:09] large Lang model is really good at and
- [11:11] there are so many different niches you
- [11:12] can potentially build like for
- [11:14] accounting firms lawyers marketing
- [11:16] agencies many of them spend hundreds of
- [11:18] hours every month to do this data entry
- [11:20] and converting job so I use wi serve to
- [11:22] build this PDF to excel converter where
- [11:24] we can drop any sorts of different type
- [11:26] of PDF files and Define all the data
- [11:29] part that you care about and it will do
- [11:31] the rest of work to extract information
- [11:33] and convert them into Excel file that
- [11:34] people can download with this one you
- [11:36] can easily tweak into specific vertical
- [11:38] solutions that you know well and maybe
- [11:40] get a smaller model to F tune and drive
- [11:42] down the cost and I'm going to show you
- [11:43] step by step how can you build this in
- [11:45] Wind serf so I'm going to set up a new
- [11:46] project in GitHub so we can keep track
- [11:48] of version and firstly I want to set up
- [11:49] a nextjs project using chassis
- [11:52] in and then I'm going to do CD converter
- [11:56] MPX CH in latest at input S car label
- [11:59] button which is a list of common
- [12:01] components we likely going to need to
- [12:02] use and to build this PDF converter the
- [12:05] pipeline looks something like this the
- [12:06] app will take a bunch of different PDFs
- [12:08] and then we're going to use llama Parts
- [12:10] which is probably the best PDF to
- [12:12] markdown converter we have on the market
- [12:13] it's basically service that can take
- [12:15] Massy PDF files extract information into
- [12:18] markdown which is a format that large
- [12:20] Dage model is really good at reading you
- [12:22] might wonder why do we need a special
- [12:24] PDF converter well that's because PDF is
- [12:27] really complex and messy there are all
- [12:29] sort different structures like tables or
- [12:32] diagrams and even equations and
- [12:34] sometimes the reading order is also
- [12:36] different you might have PDF file that
- [12:38] contain text that has to be read in
- [12:41] certain order to make sense so there are
- [12:43] whole bunch of optimization need to be
- [12:44] done to making sure large L model can
- [12:46] actually read the PDF file properly and
- [12:49] this is where llama pars is really good
- [12:51] at so we're going to use llama parts to
- [12:52] actually extract structured markdown
- [12:55] text from message PDFs and then we're
- [12:57] going to feed this data to Lar model
- [12:59] that support structured data extraction
- [13:01] like GPD 4 o model then we can flatten
- [13:04] those data into Excel file and as we
- [13:06] mentioned before we're going to use
- [13:07] nextjs as a framework and if you're not
- [13:10] familiar with the front end development
- [13:12] nextjs is a type of front end framework
- [13:15] instead of building from scratch they
- [13:17] will provide a lot of components
- [13:18] building already with specific project
- [13:20] structure and chassen and twin is just
- [13:23] the UI component and CSS library to make
- [13:26] your app looks better and we also going
- [13:28] to use npm npx they are like the package
- [13:30] manager to install third party libraries
- [13:33] so let's get started so create
- [13:35] instructions folder inside this project
- [13:37] folder and then create instruction. MD
- [13:39] file if you ever watch my other AI
- [13:41] coding videos you will know my process
- [13:43] normally start from defining a product
- [13:45] requirement dog to align with AI so that
- [13:48] whatever it is building is going to
- [13:49] deliver the result I want and the common
- [13:51] structure normally look like a project
- [13:53] overview to indicate what does the
- [13:54] project do the core functionality that I
- [13:57] wanted to deliver the relevant doc
- [13:59] implementations and important
- [14:00] implementation note to cover common
- [14:02] mistakes that AI model make as well as
- [14:05] the current file structure but one
- [14:07] really good thing about wind serve is
- [14:09] that it is really good at understanding
- [14:11] your project structure so I actually
- [14:13] don't need to do this hack anymore to
- [14:15] include the current file structure
- [14:17] because wi serve just gets it but the
- [14:19] rest of content still remain relevant
- [14:21] and I have asked wi serve team to
- [14:23] confirm that as well and this is their
- [14:25] recommendation about how much
- [14:27] information you should give up from
- [14:29] so in our case I will give this project
- [14:31] overview that your goal is build a
- [14:33] nextjs app that allow us to upload
- [14:34] multiple PDF files and use open
- [14:37] structure output to extract information
- [14:39] and convert to Excel file you'll be
- [14:41] using NEX js14 chassi and Tailwind Lucid
- [14:44] icon and then I'm going to write down
- [14:45] the core functionalities in my mind for
- [14:47] this app there are four key components
- [14:50] one is we need to allow user to upload
- [14:51] file and Define the data points that
- [14:53] they want to extract then we're going to
- [14:55] use the L parts to extract the text and
- [14:57] send to open AI to process those data
- [15:00] and in the end convert into a Excel file
- [15:02] so people can download and I normally
- [15:04] tend to specify very detailed behavior
- [15:06] that I want so here is what I put for
- [15:08] the file upload and schema definition so
- [15:11] user should be able to upload one or
- [15:12] more PDF files and they should be able
- [15:14] to Define data point they want to
- [15:16] extract it can be either individual
- [15:18] fields or can be groups which is like
- [15:20] array of objects that they want to
- [15:22] extract and this could be useful for
- [15:24] things like bank statement or invoice
- [15:26] where you might have a list of
- [15:28] information with similar structure that
- [15:29] you want to capture and for each group
- [15:31] users can Define multiple Fields inside
- [15:34] as well or even other group to create
- [15:36] this kind of Nast structure and there
- [15:37] should be a button star extraction and I
- [15:40] also want to set a default schema to
- [15:42] Showcase how does this software works so
- [15:44] I'm just going to give a uh default
- [15:47] value in then here I mentioned that it
- [15:49] need to be server side file processing
- [15:51] basically in front end rment each
- [15:53] function you can do on the client side
- [15:54] or server side and server side action
- [15:56] are good for task that require either
- [15:58] security
- [15:59] data preloading and file processing
- [16:01] typically is something handle on server
- [16:03] side the majority of Doc here you can
- [16:05] see basically just split out the
- [16:07] requirements of what kind of feature
- [16:09] that you want to build then for text
- [16:10] extraction I will say use llama for PDF
- [16:13] Tex extraction and again it is server
- [16:15] side and for each file combine all the
- [16:17] documented chunks for complete TX making
- [16:19] sure return the four TX so this is
- [16:21] something I noticed when I was using LV
- [16:24] Parts before because it will break down
- [16:26] the whole PDF into multiple different
- [16:28] chunks and quite often large L model
- [16:30] didn't know that and only extract the
- [16:32] first chunk which means we're are not
- [16:34] getting the full PDF data so I'm just
- [16:36] adding this instruction here and this
- [16:38] text extraction should happen
- [16:39] immediately after user appro the file to
- [16:41] the UI instead of waiting for the button
- [16:43] to click so that we can make this
- [16:45] process a bit faster and strictly
- [16:47] following llama procor documentation as
- [16:49] code implementation example so this is
- [16:52] actually pretty important because llama
- [16:54] parser is a fairly new package so model
- [16:57] like cloud or gbd4 didn't really have
- [16:59] much knowledge about how to use that and
- [17:01] typically what I do is I would just go
- [17:04] to their documentation and copy paste
- [17:06] the file here into my instruction Doc
- [17:08] and I we making sure the name here is
- [17:11] the same because this I believe will
- [17:12] actually help wi serve to pay attention
- [17:14] to the relevant parts of documents if
- [17:17] the identifier here is saying and after
- [17:19] each file uploaded it should be
- [17:20] displayed as an item on the page so that
- [17:23] users can click to preview the text
- [17:25] extracted and they can keep adding files
- [17:27] and this should be a server side
- [17:28] processing only and then data processing
- [17:31] so after user click on the start
- [17:32] extraction button the data should be
- [17:34] sent to open AI to process all the files
- [17:36] use open AI structure output for
- [17:38] information extraction and straightly
- [17:40] following uh the documentation that we
- [17:42] attach for open AI uh structure data
- [17:45] output and I would basically do the same
- [17:46] thing to find a relevant code example
- [17:49] that I can put in for this specific One
- [17:51] open I provide example for structure
- [17:54] data extraction so I'm going to copy and
- [17:56] paste in and one thing I will putting
- [17:58] here is is also a note that making sure
- [18:00] you use gbd4 all model and Zod for
- [18:02] defining data structure this is
- [18:04] something I found when I was using
- [18:06] cursor it almost guaranteed fail with
- [18:08] this open a functionality because
- [18:10] structure output is very new feature
- [18:12] that open a released and large L model
- [18:14] didn't have that knowledge when I using
- [18:17] cursor it wasn't that great in terms of
- [18:19] fetching the right code example inside
- [18:21] the documentations so it tend to
- [18:23] implement in the oldfashioned way and
- [18:25] this is where you will see wind server
- [18:26] that is really good at and last part we
- [18:29] will also put documentation for file
- [18:31] download so combine all typ data process
- [18:33] from multiple different file into one
- [18:35] Excel when there next structure flatten
- [18:37] them and we should have proper error
- [18:40] handling and enable Excel file download
- [18:43] and we also want to implement tempor
- [18:44] file clean up because otherwise all the
- [18:46] Excel file uploaded will just keep ping
- [18:49] up and that's pretty much it um the last
- [18:51] thing I would do is that I will also
- [18:53] include some important implementation
- [18:55] notes so in my AI coding workflow I tend
- [18:58] to keep track about list of common
- [19:00] arrows here so that it's less likely it
- [19:02] will make those mistakes so with this
- [19:04] one it's pretty much ready to go we can
- [19:05] start let wi serve to implement this app
- [19:08] for us I'm going to open Cascade which
- [19:10] is a coding agent in wi serve and then
- [19:13] give instruction I want to build a
- [19:14] nextjs app for user to upload PDF files
- [19:17] and convert into Excel Implement
- [19:19] strictly based on this instruction that
- [19:21] I give I've set up the project already
- [19:23] in this folder now let's build this uh
- [19:25] first feature which is file upload and
- [19:27] schema definition so there are few
- [19:29] things that you will see happening if
- [19:30] first say go inside the instruction file
- [19:34] and then look up the revant chunk you
- [19:36] can see which lines of code it actually
- [19:39] uh looks through then you also check
- [19:41] what kind of components already exist in
- [19:43] this project to making sure it is
- [19:45] creating file in the right place and
- [19:47] what you will see here is that compare
- [19:49] with cursor composer after every step
- [19:52] here it can reflect a bit of what has
- [19:54] been done before and then move on to the
- [19:56] next step and after this is done you
- [19:58] will also see something cool in the code
- [20:00] it generate it used a few UI component
- [20:02] library that we haven't installed yet so
- [20:04] it will generate the terminal command
- [20:06] and ask ask for approval and if I just
- [20:09] accept here it will run command line and
- [20:11] move on to next step and this is really
- [20:13] good because if your command line has
- [20:15] some arrows it will also get as feedback
- [20:18] so they can iterate and design Next Step
- [20:20] based on that and let's try to run this
- [20:22] our open Terminal and then do mpm run
- [20:26] def cool so you can see this app is
- [20:28] already already build where I can upload
- [20:30] files and can also Define the specific
- [20:32] data point that I care about I can give
- [20:34] a name data type the description here if
- [20:37] it's group I can Define information
- [20:39] further as well great so now I'm going
- [20:41] to move to Next Step let's do step two
- [20:45] and what happen next is it actually will
- [20:47] go back to instruction. MD and look for
- [20:50] the revant information as part of
- [20:52] context and here notice that I need to
- [20:55] install new libraries so I will just
- [20:57] accept that
- [21:02] okay so it finished uh but it got Arrow
- [21:05] this Arrow basically means that we
- [21:06] haven't really add this dialogue
- [21:08] component from the chassis in you can
- [21:10] actually copy paste this in and then it
- [21:13] should be able to round the right
- [21:14] command for you as well but one thing to
- [21:16] know is that at default I think cloud
- [21:19] 3.5 uh is still using the old syntax
- [21:22] which chass and UI and that will cause
- [21:24] issues so just making sure you add
- [21:26] special instruction like this if you're
- [21:28] using chassis and into documentations
- [21:30] and what's really cool here is that
- [21:32] because of this Arrow it also kind of
- [21:34] reflect to say oh we need to check if
- [21:37] other components that required also
- [21:39] install and also look up the file dog to
- [21:41] double check now next two things we need
- [21:43] to do based on previous instruction is
- [21:44] one is ADD llama paror API key another
- [21:47] is I need to create a folder uh inside
- [21:49] project route for uploaded files so you
- [21:52] can either just create a folder here for
- [21:55] plose dat but you can also ask insert to
- [21:58] do this for you if you need but I'll
- [22:00] just create a ARL here and we also need
- [22:02] to get llama pars API you will create
- [22:05] account on cloud. Lama index. a and then
- [22:08] go to API Keys creating new API Keys
- [22:10] here and go Tov paste your API key so
- [22:13] now we can refresh the page and give a
- [22:15] try I'll upload this example PDF files
- [22:18] and once finished there will be a view
- [22:20] text button if you click on that you can
- [22:22] see that the text has been extracted
- [22:24] properly into markdown file based on the
- [22:26] original invoice PDF great so so now we
- [22:28] can move to Next Step let's do the step
- [22:31] three and this is a part that I'm very
- [22:33] interested in because as I mentioned
- [22:35] before Cloud 3.5 has no idea about the
- [22:38] latest structur output functionality but
- [22:40] you can see here in the wind surf the
- [22:42] first thing it does is go to the
- [22:44] relevant part of instruction so you
- [22:46] understand what's the latest syntax then
- [22:48] decide need to install this open Ai and
- [22:50] Z components which is bredent that means
- [22:53] it probably will Implement in the right
- [22:55] way and then it'll also try to use a
- [22:58] chass in table and what's brilliant
- [23:00] about this is Wier somehow just remember
- [23:02] those things a lot better and use the
- [23:04] right syntax and this release much less
- [23:07] arrows as you can
- [23:09] see all right this function is done all
- [23:12] we need to do just adding the open AI
- [23:14] API key here in the EMV file as well
- [23:17] then we can try to run this go back
- [23:19] upload the file and I just want to go
- [23:22] quickly double check if it is
- [23:24] implementing the right way so if I go to
- [23:26] process data you can see that it is
- [23:28] using the right model and using exactly
- [23:30] the right format that we asked to and as
- [23:33] a result it showed us the table that we
- [23:34] were looking for so this is a brilliant
- [23:37] I'm just going to ask it to do the last
- [23:39] part which is uh file download and again
- [23:42] it will ask me to install this
- [23:45] package all right so this part is done
- [23:47] as well we can go back to the
- [23:49] application upload the file and then do
- [23:52] the extraction and once the data is
- [23:54] extracted you can see this download
- [23:56] Excel file button if I click on that
- [23:58] that the result is showing in a proper
- [24:00] Excel table so this whole functionality
- [24:02] is done already as you can see wi serf
- [24:04] did a really good job in terms of
- [24:06] extracting and referencing to the latest
- [24:08] stock because both llama pars and the
- [24:11] open AI structure output are not part of
- [24:13] the lar n model's knowledge but it was
- [24:15] able to reference to the ride dog that I
- [24:17] putting here and last bit I just want to
- [24:19] do some quick UI touchup because now the
- [24:21] style looks a bit kind of boring and one
- [24:23] thing I did learn from our community
- [24:25] member Garrett in the AI build Club is
- [24:27] that we can use v.d Sims to control much
- [24:31] better UI for example if you go to vz.
- [24:35] d/s you can click on same to clone same
- [24:37] and playing with different styles on the
- [24:39] left you can even get AI to generate a
- [24:41] special same that you want but for me I
- [24:43] kind of want to use this kind of Windows
- [24:45] 98 type of style and once you finish you
- [24:47] can copy code uh and just paste those
- [24:50] code into your nextjs project one by one
- [24:53] so I will paste this CSS file which is a
- [24:56] global CSS paste it in and then the
- [24:59] fonts file in the layout. TS which is
- [25:02] under your app folder and then tailing
- [25:04] config which should be in your root
- [25:06] folder and now you can try to run this
- [25:08] uh okay looks like we got some arrows
- [25:10] that I need to define the font weight uh
- [25:12] so you can just paste this uh Arrow
- [25:15] message in and one really cool things
- [25:17] about wind serve is that you can see
- [25:19] that it actually knows what kind of
- [25:21] modification you made recently without
- [25:23] prompting it so that it has more
- [25:25] contacts and are able to fix those
- [25:26] things directly for you
- [25:28] cool so we got this kind of Windows 98
- [25:31] style UI here and another thing I do
- [25:34] kind of curious to try out is that how
- [25:35] good a wi serve is in terms of
- [25:38] understanding your existing Pur
- [25:40] structure and adding new feature to it
- [25:42] so I would just start a new Cascade and
- [25:44] I assume it probably didn't have contact
- [25:46] or past chat history to understand where
- [25:48] we create which file so I'm going to
- [25:51] just give you instruction without any
- [25:52] context makes the app a lot more mobile
- [25:55] friendly and I want to display upload
- [25:57] file UI and schema definition UI side by
- [26:00] side and make a star extraction button
- [26:02] sticky at the bottom with primary color
- [26:04] Windows blue so you can see what it does
- [26:07] is that it firstly analyze it look into
- [26:10] our page. TSX which is main file try to
- [26:13] analyze file and understand what all the
- [26:15] different components available there and
- [26:17] then try to identify where the right
- [26:19] place to implement those Chang and if I
- [26:21] go back to the application you can say
- [26:23] just transform the UI for me without me
- [26:26] prompting it at all and it is fully
- [26:28] functional as well so that's pretty much
- [26:30] it if you are interested in how to use
- [26:32] VZ same and how to build UI part a lot
- [26:35] better G actually did a course inside
- [26:37] our AI Builder club and if you don't
- [26:40] know what AI Builder Club is it is a
- [26:42] community that we're building where we
- [26:44] dive deeper into all sorts different AI
- [26:46] coding and agent building courses with a
- [26:48] step-by-step tutorial and code examples
- [26:51] and most importantly we have this group
- [26:52] of top AI Builders who might already
- [26:54] experience the problem that you are
- [26:56] facing with so you can just come and ask
- [26:58] questions to so feel free to click on
- [27:00] the link in the description below to
- [27:02] join this AI build Club I hope you enjoy
- [27:04] this video so this pretty much how we
- [27:05] can use wind serve to create
- [27:07] applications as you can see just making
- [27:10] the agent much more context aware even
- [27:13] though it is still not type of platform
- [27:15] where you can just go give one single
- [27:17] instruction and it will work out
- [27:19] everything for you but the code quality
- [27:21] is much better I'm very excited about
- [27:23] what type of interesting tips and tricks
- [27:25] you guys start finding using wi serf so
- [27:27] please comment Bel for sharing any
- [27:29] interesting insights you have thank you
- [27:30] and I see you next time
