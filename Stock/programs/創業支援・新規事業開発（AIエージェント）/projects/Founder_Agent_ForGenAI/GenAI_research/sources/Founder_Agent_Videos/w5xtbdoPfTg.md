- [00:01] Hello, I'm Matt Marshall, founder and
- [00:03] editor-inchief of VentureBeat, and I'm
- [00:05] excited to share a new podcast project
- [00:07] we've been working on. We're calling it
- [00:09] Beyond the Pilot: Enterprise AI in
- [00:12] action. At Venturebe, we have
- [00:13] conversations every day with leaders and
- [00:15] teams across various industries to bring
- [00:17] you coverage about the latest in
- [00:19] enterprise AI. And from my vantage
- [00:21] point, the conversation has really
- [00:23] started to change from, can I dream as
- [00:25] big as I can to a question of, hey, can
- [00:28] I actually just build something that's
- [00:30] sustainable and really works for me?
- [00:32] That race to scale fueled by supposedly
- [00:35] neverending cloud resources is colliding
- [00:38] with brutal realities of physics and
- [00:40] finance and ROI. Let's be honest, over
- [00:42] the last 6 months, I bet your AI
- [00:44] playbook has become outdated. I've
- [00:46] teamed up with my friend Sam Whitphine,
- [00:48] who's a developer and a leader in AI
- [00:50] coverage to dive into what real
- [00:52] companies, industry leaders, and
- [00:54] decision makers are actually doing and
- [00:56] to learn about their experiences putting
- [00:57] AI into action. We're hoping to uncover
- [00:59] what they've done wrong, what they've
- [01:01] done right, and how they've overcome
- [01:03] real problems as they've moved beyond
- [01:04] the pilot. So, I think your task is
- [01:06] really to listen for those trade-offs.
- [01:08] There's not one single answer. You're
- [01:10] going to have to gather intelligence for
- [01:12] your playbook, and the space is moving
- [01:14] really quickly. We're going to keep up
- [01:16] with that conversation. So, thank you
- [01:18] for listening. Here's the first episode.
- [01:24] This is Venture Beats Beyond the Pilot,
- [01:26] Enterprise AI in action. I'm Samine.
- [01:29] >> I'm Matt Marshall. Today's episode is
- [01:32] presented by Outshift by Cisco, Cisco's
- [01:34] emerging tech incubation engine and
- [01:37] driver of Aentic AI, Quantum, NextG,
- [01:40] Infra, and beyond.
- [01:42] Today we're talking with Ryan Nestrom,
- [01:44] who's helped build some of the products
- [01:46] that have defined the mobile era at
- [01:48] places like Instagram. He's also created
- [01:51] a bunch of popular iOS libraries. And
- [01:54] Brian currently leads the AI team at
- [01:56] Notion that has recently built Notion
- [01:59] 3.0 for agents. So, this is creating
- [02:03] agents right inside the second brain
- [02:05] that's used by millions of users. For
- [02:08] us, what makes Notion story so
- [02:10] compelling is that they weren't an AI
- [02:12] native company. They're injecting this
- [02:14] new intelligence into a product that
- [02:17] people have been relying on for a number
- [02:19] of years already. Ryan's been on the
- [02:22] front lines discovering the differences
- [02:24] between trying to teach your AI a
- [02:26] complex system versus getting your
- [02:29] system to speak the AI's language.
- [02:32] Welcome to the pod, Ryan. It's great to
- [02:34] have you.
- [02:35] >> Thank you so much. I'm excited to jump
- [02:38] into some of the things we did uh on
- [02:40] notion's AI and agent systems.
- [02:44] >> So I I kind of think that you've got a
- [02:46] really interesting sort of perspective
- [02:48] in like I mentioned in the intro, you've
- [02:51] got this history in the mobile era and
- [02:54] you know you you worked at sort of one
- [02:56] of the premier sort of uh companies that
- [02:59] took mobile to to the next level kind of
- [03:02] thing being Instagram. Um, not only
- [03:05] that, along the way you you built a
- [03:07] bunch of sort of, you know, uh,
- [03:09] well-known iOS libraries, uh, wi with
- [03:13] that you were very involved in that
- [03:15] community. I'm kind of interested to
- [03:17] sort of get your a little bit of your
- [03:19] history of how you thought about that
- [03:22] back then. Uh, and then how did that
- [03:24] transition into where you are now at
- [03:26] notion?
- [03:28] Yeah, I I got my start basically in
- [03:32] engineering and coding um because of of
- [03:36] mobile because of the iPad and the
- [03:39] iPhone. Um I was just kind of wowed by
- [03:44] this technology that I could not only
- [03:47] take with me but also like touch and
- [03:49] interact with. And that's what really
- [03:52] got me excited. Um, I also really felt
- [03:55] like back when I when I was getting
- [03:57] started in like 2010, 2011,
- [04:00] um, we were in the middle of this like
- [04:02] revolution where everything was
- [04:04] switching to mobile and one of my one of
- [04:08] my my first really big tech job was was
- [04:10] working at Instagram and kind of riding
- [04:13] that wave of everyone I mean, you know,
- [04:17] Instagram being owned by Facebook where
- [04:19] people were migrating from doing things
- [04:21] on their computer on Facebook to sharing
- [04:25] and socializing on their phone. Um, and
- [04:28] I found that really exciting. Um, I
- [04:30] wanted to build product. I wanted to
- [04:32] build tools. I wanted to build things
- [04:33] that people could touch and use. And
- [04:38] what really gets me excited about this
- [04:40] time in AI
- [04:43] is I'm feeling the same sort of like wow
- [04:47] and like magic with these tools.
- [04:50] um you know comparing like LMS today
- [04:52] which are already extremely advanced um
- [04:55] with things like GPD5 and Sonnet 45
- [04:58] which are kind of the latest latest and
- [05:00] greatest frontier models. It's almost
- [05:02] like you compare these to when I got
- [05:03] started with iPhone. It was like the
- [05:04] iPhone 4, you know, it wasn't the first
- [05:06] gen. It wasn't the iPhone 1 which like
- [05:09] was kind of magic but like was super
- [05:11] limited. Didn't have an app store or
- [05:13] anything. Um, and we went through these
- [05:15] different phases of the iPhone where
- [05:17] they got faster, sleeker, more powerful.
- [05:20] Um, got the app store, you had more
- [05:22] SDKs, more APIs, and more things that
- [05:24] you could do. Then we had more hardware
- [05:26] like the iPad, um, the watch. And I feel
- [05:29] like this is kind of happening again um,
- [05:31] in the industry with LMS and with AI.
- [05:34] Um, we're getting tool calling. uh we're
- [05:37] getting more and more features like the
- [05:39] companies are building you their own
- [05:41] versions of like app stores and computer
- [05:43] use and browsers and all these things.
- [05:46] Um and we don't know exactly like where
- [05:49] this is going to go but we see the value
- [05:52] in the technology and so we're all just
- [05:54] trying to like build things and figure
- [05:56] out how to like make this work for us.
- [05:58] um you know a as somebody who writes
- [06:01] code like it's become like immensely
- [06:04] valuable to my workflow and now we're
- [06:06] trying to like expand that value to like
- [06:09] everyday tasks. Um and that's what I'm
- [06:12] trying to do here at at notion as well
- [06:13] like we have this platform we have this
- [06:15] product how can we bring that sort of
- [06:17] joy and magic that we're experiencing on
- [06:19] the engineering side to uh this
- [06:22] productivity software. So that's super
- [06:24] interesting that you're starting to see
- [06:26] this explosion like you mentioned, you
- [06:28] know, originally from the mobile era,
- [06:30] now this AI era. Um, can you tell us a
- [06:33] little bit about how you got involved in
- [06:34] notion, where, you know, sort of notion
- [06:37] was perhaps with their AI journey when
- [06:40] you first uh arrived?
- [06:43] >> Yeah, it's it's a little funny. I was
- [06:46] doing a startup um with one of my uh
- [06:49] great friends and founder co-founder um
- [06:53] and we were trying to build uh we have
- [06:55] this sort of like vendetta against
- [06:56] Slack. I I think that Slack can be like
- [07:00] >> Yeah.
- [07:03] This is a kind of a fault of my own.
- [07:04] Like I the pings and the badges and the
- [07:07] alerts happen and I'm like eager to go
- [07:09] help people and unblock, but I'll like
- [07:11] then I'll end my day having been like,
- [07:13] "Oh my god, I've just been in Slack all
- [07:15] day." Like I didn't write any code. Uh
- [07:17] so we were building this startup to to
- [07:19] try and solve some of that problem. Um
- [07:21] it was more of like a writing focused uh
- [07:24] product, but still was for like async
- [07:27] remote work. Um and we did our startup
- [07:30] for a few years. it never got like the
- [07:32] traction that we wanted and um you know
- [07:35] at the time the the the sort of irony is
- [07:38] that like on our website at one time we
- [07:40] had like you should not use notion you
- [07:43] should use our software instead and that
- [07:46] like I think put each other on each or
- [07:48] put us on each other's radars and um
- [07:51] when our startup wasn't working we uh we
- [07:54] reached out to some folks at notion and
- [07:55] found out that like us actually would be
- [07:57] kind of share the same like design
- [07:59] language and product philosophy fee um
- [08:02] and found a found a great home and
- [08:04] opportunity over here. And originally we
- [08:07] were not even going to come to work on
- [08:09] AI um because we had been working on
- [08:11] like workplace comms and communication
- [08:14] and stuff. But as soon as we joined um
- [08:17] there was this sort of resurgence into
- [08:22] notion's AI tools and systems and we
- [08:24] were uh there was a lot of experimental
- [08:26] stuff going on at the time. Um, and it
- [08:29] was very uh experimental and innovative
- [08:33] in terms of like the way we were using
- [08:36] uh LMS and AI, but we needed to put some
- [08:39] like product finesse on it. Um, and my
- [08:42] co-founder uh Brian Leven uh is a
- [08:45] designer. I'm an engineer. Both of us
- [08:47] are like product people as well. And so
- [08:49] we were able to join this like extremely
- [08:51] technical project and put like a product
- [08:53] lens on it. Um, and we went through a
- [08:57] bunch of different iterations of what it
- [09:00] should have been. Um, we were exploring
- [09:03] crazy stuff like codegen within notion
- [09:07] and all these really wild automations.
- [09:11] Um, they were incredibly impressive. Uh,
- [09:13] and from that we discovered um this sort
- [09:17] of like agentic loop and tool calling
- [09:19] loop um that worked really really well
- [09:22] and we leaned really hard into that and
- [09:25] that is eventually what became our
- [09:28] notion 3.0 moment um that we announced
- [09:30] at make with notion this year.
- [09:33] >> Ryan and very interesting we want to get
- [09:36] further into that product obviously. Um
- [09:40] going back to
- [09:42] briefly to um the experience you had
- [09:45] during the mobile era, right? You
- [09:47] mentioned that feeling of being on the
- [09:49] bleeding edge again of you know chasing
- [09:51] new APIs.
- [09:53] >> Um one of the things about mobile though
- [09:56] is you built software and you had the
- [09:58] iOS system and platform. It worked right
- [10:02] that was the beauty of iOS. You know
- [10:04] obviously Android was a competitor. How
- [10:06] is building that stochastic you know
- [10:09] non-deterministic AI product different
- [10:12] when you when you go back to that era of
- [10:14] excitement um you know you know how is
- [10:17] it different now from that deterministic
- [10:19] world where things worked right the
- [10:21] traditional software mobile engineering
- [10:22] background that you have I yeah I still
- [10:26] really struggle with this um because I
- [10:28] I've got you know over a decade of like
- [10:32] trai almost want to like traditional
- [10:34] software engineering ing experience
- [10:36] where I'm like it's extremely
- [10:38] deterministic. Um when I write code that
- [10:41] expects this output like it is so simple
- [10:44] to understand debug. Um there were when
- [10:50] I started working with AI at at our
- [10:53] former startup, we were doing a little
- [10:55] bit of a AI stuff and then coming here
- [10:58] um I really had to like rewire myself to
- [11:03] like understand how to work with these
- [11:05] things. And one of my like key moments
- [11:09] was when I was working with um one of
- [11:12] our our co-founders at Notion, Simon, um
- [11:16] said something about uh was giving me
- [11:18] feedback on like a code change that I
- [11:20] was making, a prompt change, and he was
- [11:22] like, "Describe this as you would
- [11:26] describe to an intern." And I was like,
- [11:29] "Well, like I'm trying to like codify
- [11:31] the rules of how this like LM should
- [11:33] behave in this condition." And he's
- [11:35] like, "Yeah, yeah, but like these are
- [11:37] trained on like content generated by
- [11:41] people and so they they are going to
- [11:43] like understand or reason better like
- [11:46] people will." And that was just like a
- [11:48] light bulb moment to me that I was like,
- [11:50] "Oh man, I'm really like
- [11:53] it's almost like an organic thing like
- [11:55] I'm like talking to it and explaining to
- [11:57] it." And really now whenever I'm like
- [12:01] working with AI, I'm starting to I will
- [12:04] like reread the prompts and and tool
- [12:07] descriptions and all these things and be
- [12:08] like, is this something that I could
- [12:10] give to a person with like no context
- [12:12] and they could somewhat understand
- [12:14] what's going on. If not, then it's going
- [12:18] to do a bad job. Um, and that's like fun
- [12:22] because there's like so much logic that
- [12:25] can be baked into just like English
- [12:27] instructions. It's also like as a
- [12:29] traditional software person like kind of
- [12:31] horrifying because sometimes things work
- [12:34] in ways that are incredibly
- [12:36] unpredictable.
- [12:37] Um, they can go sideways. They can
- [12:40] interpret things differently. And then
- [12:42] you add into the mix um like different
- [12:45] models uh that like have their own
- [12:48] preferences and behaviors and like
- [12:50] training data built in. So it's I find
- [12:52] it like very like weird but in a fun
- [12:56] way. Like it's really it's really fun
- [12:58] weird um because you can end up doing a
- [13:00] lot of like really interesting quirky
- [13:02] things um with LMS.
- [13:05] This series is presented by Outshift,
- [13:07] Cisco's emerging tech incubation engine
- [13:10] and driver of the internet of agents, an
- [13:13] open interoperable internet for
- [13:15] agent-to-agent collaboration. Learn more
- [13:18] about the internet of agents and explore
- [13:20] how Agentic systems are the future at
- [13:23] outshift.isco.com.
- [13:26] And Ryan, where do you feel like we are
- [13:28] on that
- [13:30] journey? Right. I think there's a
- [13:32] there's a sense that we we were
- [13:34] obviously scaling the models. Um
- [13:38] there's improvement through
- [13:39] reinforcement learning, right? There's
- [13:41] the reasoning. There's there is this
- [13:43] trajectory, but there there there's also
- [13:45] kind of this brewing discontent with
- [13:48] hallucinations and and the limits of of
- [13:51] that reasoning, right? There was talk of
- [13:52] AGI, right? AGI was around the corner.
- [13:55] um that's all disappeared as you joined
- [13:58] the company and and where and where you
- [14:00] are where you feel things are now. Can
- [14:02] you give us a sense of where we are on
- [14:04] that that journey?
- [14:06] >> I I really feel, you know, using uh this
- [14:08] like mobile comparison. It's almost like
- [14:12] we're in the like Palm OS era. We're
- [14:16] like pre BlackBerry pre pre iPhone, you
- [14:19] know? It's like it's so I think it is so
- [14:23] early. Um, I I think that there's a lot
- [14:27] of valid criticism of what LLMs and
- [14:30] especially like agentic systems are
- [14:33] capable of. And that's that's one thing
- [14:36] that I think we've learned the hard way
- [14:38] building um not even just the current
- [14:42] version of Notion AI, but like the
- [14:43] previous iterations of it. And
- [14:47] the thing that gets me excited though is
- [14:49] like the pace of change is like so fast
- [14:52] that you know it'd be almost like if we
- [14:55] there were plenty of people who like poo
- [14:56] pooed the palm pilot and we're like ah
- [14:59] this is like going nowhere. Like it can
- [15:01] barely like detect my like handwriting
- [15:03] when I'm like doing um the like notation
- [15:06] on it. But like look where we are now. I
- [15:09] mean look how much it's changed in what
- [15:12] 30 years like less. Um, I I think that
- [15:16] like there's a lot of of comparisons and
- [15:20] I think that things are moving like even
- [15:21] faster because like GPT 3 was like a
- [15:25] couple years ago and that was like okay.
- [15:29] I mean GPD4 I think a lot of us was like
- [15:32] the breakthrough moment and and that
- [15:34] even compared to what things can do now
- [15:36] which is like a year and a half later or
- [15:38] something. I mean it's crazy this stuff
- [15:40] is changing so fast. Do you do you find
- [15:42] it's different this time though in that
- [15:45] like before you kind of had to pick your
- [15:47] camp, right? You were either iOS or you
- [15:49] were Android, right? And and and you
- [15:52] would never go from one to the other
- [15:54] kind of thing, right? We But now people,
- [15:57] you know, it it's it's almost like
- [15:59] people are, you know, happily changing
- [16:03] models every, you know, every week kind
- [16:05] of thing or if not even sooner. So do
- [16:08] you I'm curious to sort of get your take
- [16:10] on how do you see the differences
- [16:12] between say an open AI with the GPT
- [16:15] models the clawed models from anthropic
- [16:18] perhaps Google or the the other Chinese
- [16:20] companies etc.
- [16:22] I I I love that. Um I I remember when I
- [16:28] got like very into mobile I was just
- [16:30] like diehard Apple like Android sucks.
- [16:34] It's never going to be that good. it and
- [16:37] you know working on Instagram we had
- [16:38] like a handful of iOS engineers and we
- [16:41] had a handful of like Android engineers
- [16:43] and like we very like the cultures were
- [16:46] so different the people were so
- [16:48] different. Um though the fun fact is
- [16:50] that like probably nine out of 10
- [16:52] Android engineers used an iPhone. So
- [16:54] like I think that iPhone was clear was
- [16:57] clearly the choice. Anyways, uh but I
- [17:00] what I love about the the current state
- [17:03] of things is that um these like frontier
- [17:07] models are competing with each other or
- [17:09] not not the models but like these
- [17:11] frontier research labs are competing
- [17:13] with each other and they are learning
- [17:15] from each other. Uh they are innovating
- [17:17] they're they are sharing information.
- [17:20] they're also like keeping um some of
- [17:23] their their biggest innovations, you
- [17:26] know, uh secret and stuff. And I I just
- [17:29] think that this competition is really
- [17:31] good um for the industry. Um for us at
- [17:34] Notion, we benefit because these
- [17:38] frontier labs are trying to like build
- [17:40] the best model and they're trying to out
- [17:42] compete each other and then we are just
- [17:45] going to use the one that fits our needs
- [17:47] the best. Um, and so we are constantly
- [17:50] evaluating uh the new models. We pretty
- [17:53] much are are staying in the like
- [17:55] anthropic and open AI camps. Um, it
- [17:58] that's that's what's just worked out
- [17:59] best for us. We'll always play with new
- [18:01] models as they come out. Um, but it is
- [18:04] it is quite different. You you will get
- [18:06] some people that are like, "Oh, GBD5
- [18:08] like picks up on my writing style or
- [18:11] it's got a um a way of doing tool
- [18:14] calling that's preferable to me." And um
- [18:17] I think that that's I think that that's
- [18:19] great, but I also notice the way that
- [18:22] these are changing so quickly. Um you
- [18:25] know, Sonnet 45 came out like a a month
- [18:28] month and a half ago or something. And
- [18:30] it like one of our biggest issues with
- [18:32] Sonnet 4 is it would only do tool calls
- [18:34] kind of like one at a time and wouldn't
- [18:36] do them in parallel very often. And four
- [18:38] five is all of a sudden just like I'll
- [18:39] do as many tools at once as I think is
- [18:42] is um necessary. And that was like a
- [18:44] huge leap forward. And now I'm like,
- [18:46] "Oh, Sonic 45 is like pretty great now."
- [18:48] Um, and so, and I even I even see that
- [18:51] on like the tools that I use, like I
- [18:53] will flip-flop between Cloud Code and
- [18:56] Codeex pretty regularly based on uh
- [18:59] either model innovations or even just
- [19:01] like product innovations. Um, and so it
- [19:04] it is cool that I don't think people are
- [19:08] stuck in one camp um very much. You
- [19:11] know, there was such a clear difference
- [19:12] between like Apple
- [19:15] um or like iOS and Android. Like there
- [19:18] were just things that one prioritized
- [19:22] over the other. Android being like very
- [19:24] open, iOS being like closed but also
- [19:26] like super polished, super performant.
- [19:29] Um that's changed nowadays. Uh I think
- [19:31] they're both pretty comparable or even,
- [19:34] you know, inverted a little bit. Um but
- [19:36] yeah, on the model side, um yeah, I I
- [19:40] see less like the FFTs. It's not like
- [19:41] here at Notion we have a a camp of
- [19:44] anthropic engineers and open AAI
- [19:46] engineers. We all we all just use LLMs.
- [19:49] >> Ryan, you describe Notion's journey into
- [19:51] Gen AI is almost an accident built on
- [19:54] years of prior work. Can can you unpack
- [19:57] the pre-existing ingredients
- [19:59] like search connected apps and and the
- [20:02] collaborative editor that Notion had
- [20:04] that became the foundation for your
- [20:06] agent?
- [20:07] >> Yeah. Yeah. I I I know it wasn't like uh
- [20:12] an accident that we created this agentic
- [20:14] notion AI, but like when I kind of
- [20:15] replay how we got here, it it it almost
- [20:18] feels like the stars aligned. So like
- [20:20] notion's history um briefly because I've
- [20:23] only been here, you know, one year out
- [20:26] of I think Notion's been around. I mean
- [20:28] Notion as like a company uh with the
- [20:31] co-founders has been around for like 13
- [20:33] years. um in its current form I think
- [20:36] since 2016 2017 um but essentially
- [20:41] notion started as like wikis and pages
- [20:43] you know like sort of like collaborative
- [20:45] docs they added databases so you could
- [20:47] do more project management um and then
- [20:50] added things like connected apps where I
- [20:53] could connect say GitHub Slack u there's
- [20:57] a whole bunch of different connections
- [20:59] but those are the two that that I I use
- [21:01] a ton um And then I can both like embed
- [21:05] content within notion from those apps.
- [21:08] And then we started like indexing and um
- [21:13] ranking content from those apps so that
- [21:15] I could be within notion search for
- [21:18] what's one that I love doing. Oh, like
- [21:19] what's the Wi-Fi in the New York office?
- [21:22] Um and I can like search within content
- [21:25] that's already in Notion. But like if
- [21:27] that conversation about the Wi-Fi
- [21:28] password was also on Slack, our search
- [21:31] tools could go out into like the Slack
- [21:34] content and find it and then present it
- [21:37] to you. And now we can actually use AI
- [21:40] to do this like retrieval um augmented
- [21:44] generation. You can ask the AI a
- [21:46] question and then we could generate say
- [21:48] like five different queries or questions
- [21:50] for like what you asked and then go out
- [21:53] into our um indexes, our vector stores
- [21:58] and like go find the content that like
- [22:00] closely matches that base and that
- [22:01] content could come from GitHub, it could
- [22:03] come from Slack and of course it can be
- [22:05] within notion itself and then we can
- [22:08] take all that information give it back
- [22:10] to an LLM and then like ingest and find
- [22:14] the answer that you're looking for. Um,
- [22:16] and so we ended up building this system
- [22:19] which is what we call we'll call it deep
- [22:21] find or enterprise search. And so that
- [22:24] shipped I think that shipped like two
- [22:26] years ago. Um, and then we built this uh
- [22:31] with GPT4.
- [22:33] We built writer uh we built an assistant
- [22:36] within notion. And so we start building
- [22:39] these like foundational pieces of using
- [22:42] AI within notion. And then fast forward
- [22:45] to like this year, we essentially have
- [22:49] all of these parts built. We have the
- [22:52] core primitives of notion. We have a
- [22:54] rich collaborative workspace also rich
- [22:57] with like permission checking um uh and
- [23:01] those sort of things. We have this block
- [23:03] structure in notion that's like highly
- [23:05] composable. Um and then we have this
- [23:08] advanced search functionality and we
- [23:10] have the ability to write with AI. we
- [23:13] have like all of this stuff. And so it
- [23:15] was like a matter of seeing that all of
- [23:18] these pieces already existed in some
- [23:20] form and then building a system that can
- [23:23] bring them all together. Uh which is
- [23:25] what we essentially call our notion
- [23:27] agent. Um and so we would build tools
- [23:30] that connect to all of these different
- [23:32] parts. Tools like search, tools like uh
- [23:36] writing to a page, querying a database,
- [23:39] um all these sort of things. So yeah, it
- [23:41] was it was really like we were we were
- [23:44] able to pull together years of work,
- [23:49] research, learnings, technology, um, and
- [23:52] then assemble it into our current agent.
- [23:56] >> Ryan, walk us through maybe if you if
- [23:59] you can remember what it what it felt
- [24:00] like. So So you joined about a year ago.
- [24:03] It's some change plus or minus. Um, so
- [24:08] Notion has all these connectors, right?
- [24:10] They've been clearly working on Gen AI
- [24:13] uh tracking the Gen AI revolution.
- [24:16] You're coming in as as you said from the
- [24:18] startup, right? With actually not
- [24:21] necessarily being on the bleeding edge
- [24:23] of Gen AI, right? You're you're trying
- [24:26] to kill Slack or something. So, can you
- [24:28] can you walk us through
- [24:30] >> that founder conversation and what it
- [24:32] felt like because essentially it sounds
- [24:33] like you came on to actually build the
- [24:34] agent. You you said something about how
- [24:36] there were maybe two people there
- [24:38] working on the project. Can you walk us
- [24:39] through what that felt like?
- [24:42] >> It really felt like being tossed into
- [24:44] the deep end. Um because my my
- [24:48] co-founder and I had to learn uh not
- [24:52] only AI uh we had to learn aic systems
- [24:56] um and we had to learn like notion uh at
- [24:59] the same time. Like notion is a a huge
- [25:01] codebase. It's a huge codebase. It is um
- [25:04] it's pretty complex. Um I I think that
- [25:10] like the block system, the permission
- [25:11] system, the real time system, not to
- [25:14] mention we la we launched offline this
- [25:16] year which has its own like uh CRDT or
- [25:19] conflict conflict resolution data type
- [25:22] system. Um we had to like we had to
- [25:25] contend with like all of this stuff. We
- [25:26] had to learn all of this stuff and learn
- [25:28] how to like most effectively use AI um
- [25:32] and be like what is a good product here?
- [25:34] Uh, so it was really like having to
- [25:37] figure out a bunch of very complicated
- [25:39] pieces um at once. But what I've loved
- [25:44] is that Notion's like a very prototype
- [25:47] forward uh company and the stage that
- [25:51] things were at was like really
- [25:54] innovative and exciting but also like
- [25:56] very cobbled together. Um, and
- [26:01] I felt really free to just like go in
- [26:03] and play and like break things, change
- [26:06] things. Um, and more or less like that
- [26:09] culture is still like in the AI team. I
- [26:13] mean, we don't we don't kind of like
- [26:15] break and hack at the core agent that
- [26:17] now that we've like fully launched it,
- [26:18] but all the things that we're trying to
- [26:20] build on to it or uh extend with it or
- [26:23] like that that's very much like the
- [26:25] culture still. Um, but it was I it was
- [26:28] honestly like crazy. I had no idea what
- [26:30] I was doing. It was super complicated.
- [26:33] It took me it took me a while to like
- [26:34] ramp up and feel um comfortable, but it
- [26:38] was a matter of just kind of like
- [26:41] powering through it and like trying
- [26:43] things. I I also think that like AI is
- [26:47] still like in its infancy and so even
- [26:51] though I felt like tons of imposttor
- [26:54] syndrome, nobody else really knew what
- [26:57] they were doing. I mean, we were all
- [26:59] just trying to figure this out and like
- [27:00] push it to its limits. Um, and so I I
- [27:04] was able to play into my strengths,
- [27:05] which is like product engineering. Um,
- [27:08] and so even though I'm not an AI expert,
- [27:10] I can use an AI feature and pretty
- [27:13] intuitively figure out like, is this
- [27:15] good? Like, is this solving a problem
- [27:17] for me? Um, and so I leaned into that
- [27:19] really hard. It
- [27:20] >> it definitely sounds uh Ryan that that
- [27:23] like this was a real sort of aha moment
- [27:26] of where you kind of realized that, you
- [27:28] know, LLMs are all about context, right?
- [27:30] What you put into them. Uh, agents, the
- [27:33] same sort of thing. and and notion
- [27:36] sitting on this gold mine of context
- [27:39] right that whether that's your personal
- [27:41] notes in there whether like you you
- [27:43] mentioned that you know the connectors
- [27:44] to GitHub connectors to other things I
- [27:47] how do you sort of like can you tell us
- [27:49] a little bit about like was that you
- [27:51] know a moment that you sort of realized
- [27:52] that what were sort of the experiments
- [27:55] that sort of showed oh we've got all
- [27:57] this really good structured data in the
- [28:00] blocks and stuff like that and perhaps
- [28:02] unstructured data from other sources
- [28:04] This this was a huge moment for us, you
- [28:07] know, like like I mentioned, we were
- [28:09] experimenting with like uh really
- [28:11] advanced stuff like doing code
- [28:13] generation and and all sorts of kind of
- [28:15] wild things to help like automate
- [28:17] workflows and whatever. And and that has
- [28:19] essentially morphed into this like
- [28:21] custom agent uh product that we
- [28:23] previewed uh like a month ago. But what
- [28:27] what was really really exciting for us
- [28:30] is
- [28:32] we realized that we could just like
- [28:34] search and stuff all of this context
- [28:37] into the prompt or like the the
- [28:40] transcript that we're giving the model.
- [28:42] And it was just really good at tool
- [28:45] calling like based on that context. Um,
- [28:48] and I think one of the like aha moments
- [28:52] for us was when we realized we could get
- [28:55] rid of a lot of like
- [28:58] complicated modeling of our data. Um,
- [29:03] and just like break things down into
- [29:05] really simple terms for the model. And I
- [29:07] I I'll give you a good example. um our
- [29:10] prior version of notion AI that we
- [29:12] called like the assistant um that lived
- [29:14] in the bottom right corner. We'd
- [29:16] experimented with uh fine-tuning model
- [29:19] on top of frontier models. Uh we'd
- [29:21] experimented with pretty complicated
- [29:25] rendering of like data within notion
- [29:28] like we would use JSON in some places
- [29:30] and XML in some places and the models
- [29:33] would like do fine. But anytime you're
- [29:35] doing this like bespoke um structuring
- [29:38] of data, you like have to include
- [29:40] instructions about like what this is and
- [29:42] you have to like explain it. And a key
- [29:45] moment for us was we were trying to
- [29:49] figure out how to represent like a page
- [29:51] and page content which is this uh very
- [29:54] complex tree of blocks. Um and like we
- [29:59] had this moment we were like what if we
- [30:01] just try to figure out how to present
- [30:03] this as markdown like models are trained
- [30:06] on lots and lots of markdown. We see all
- [30:08] these uh tools and startups that can
- [30:10] represent web pages as markdown. We're
- [30:12] like, "What if we just represent a
- [30:14] notion page as markdown?" And we played
- [30:17] with it and the models were like so good
- [30:21] and we had like no instructions because
- [30:24] all of that context and reasoning about
- [30:26] what Markdown is and how to read it, how
- [30:28] to understand it, and then most
- [30:30] importantly like how to edit it is like
- [30:33] all baked in. And we had this moment
- [30:36] where we're like, "Oh, we should just
- [30:40] use the models how they were like meant
- [30:42] to be used." Like it's almost like these
- [30:45] native capabilities are built into them.
- [30:49] And so then we ended up like rewriting a
- [30:51] lot of our systems to be like to the
- [30:54] model incredibly stupid like markdown
- [30:57] JSON and that's like about it. Like
- [31:00] let's not over complicate this. The hard
- [31:03] part then came to that like middleware
- [31:06] layer where like how do you actually
- [31:08] represent a very complex
- [31:11] um page block tree as markdown and then
- [31:14] on like the flip side of that, how do
- [31:17] you let the agent write changes to a
- [31:20] like markdown file and then translate
- [31:23] that to the very complicated like block
- [31:25] structure um within notion. And that's
- [31:27] like honestly where a majority of our
- [31:30] work went is like that sort of
- [31:32] translation layer. Um moving in in and
- [31:36] out.
- [31:36] >> Do you look at that as the secret
- [31:38] source? Like it sounds really
- [31:39] interesting that once you kind of
- [31:41] realize that oh we've been trying to
- [31:43] force the model to do something it
- [31:44] didn't want to do but once we realized
- [31:46] we got markdown it's just happy to go
- [31:49] along with it. is then the secret source
- [31:52] actually you sort of writing those
- [31:54] passes those sort of systems to be able
- [31:57] to go from markdown back to the blocks
- [31:59] and I will sort of say I I've actually
- [32:02] written some code of writing blocks and
- [32:04] it was a real pain a couple years ago
- [32:05] when I did it so I can sort of relate to
- [32:08] that you know quite a lot but is that
- [32:11] something that you sort of see as the
- [32:12] secret source of this sort of
- [32:14] intermediate middleware kind of thing?
- [32:18] >> I I think so. I I think that,
- [32:22] you know, a another a really important
- [32:26] learning from all of this is that
- [32:30] we as human beings like I look I look at
- [32:33] notion and I don't see blocks and tree
- [32:37] structures and all of this stuff. I just
- [32:39] see words on a page. And so for me to
- [32:42] effectively communicate with an LM about
- [32:45] that content, the the model needs to
- [32:47] like I'm air quoting see it needs to see
- [32:51] that content almost the same way that I
- [32:52] can see it. So that when I say rewrite
- [32:55] this paragraph or like change these uh
- [32:58] bulleted lists to like numbered lists,
- [33:00] it's incredibly
- [33:02] obvious to the model like what I'm
- [33:04] talking about and like what my intent
- [33:06] is. Um, and so I I do think that this
- [33:09] sort of
- [33:12] representing Notion in a like LLM native
- [33:15] way like is kind of the secret sauce to
- [33:18] what makes notion AI really good. I also
- [33:20] think it's why like uh coding agents are
- [33:22] so good is because they're just working
- [33:24] with like the file system. Like here is
- [33:26] a text file essentially and like the
- [33:30] model has tools to interact like read
- [33:33] the text file, search for text files and
- [33:35] make changes to text files. You don't
- [33:37] you don't want to over instruct a model
- [33:40] about like here's what to do when the
- [33:42] file is Python, here's what to do when
- [33:44] the file is TypeScript because the more
- [33:46] detail and the more instruction, the
- [33:48] more uh chance for confusion and error.
- [33:51] Um, so yeah, we spend we spend an
- [33:53] enormous amount of time just trying to
- [33:55] keep our instructions and our
- [33:56] representation of notion data as simple
- [33:59] as possible.
- [34:01] >> So, so Brian, it makes a lot of sense
- [34:04] this this aha moment where okay, so
- [34:06] everything's in in markdown. So you have
- [34:09] these trees of markdown.
- [34:12] where I'd go next and maybe for our
- [34:14] listeners is they're probably thinking,
- [34:15] okay, well, you just have a a giant rag
- [34:17] against that or, you know, maybe the
- [34:20] models have have a certain amount of
- [34:22] context window
- [34:24] to allow that. But what happens when you
- [34:26] do have extremely large amounts of of
- [34:30] data, you have access to all these
- [34:32] files. I mean, this is obviously notion
- [34:34] strength. You have connectors
- [34:36] everywhere. Maybe this takes us to the
- [34:37] tools uh question in terms of how how
- [34:42] you do that. Can can you walk us through
- [34:44] a little bit more of that secret sauce?
- [34:47] >> Yeah, it it is hard. Um and I will admit
- [34:50] we've not like perfected it. Um there
- [34:53] there are cases where you can load tons
- [34:55] and tons of content into your context
- [34:58] window and the model will struggle. Um,
- [35:01] you know, the more context that you put
- [35:04] into
- [35:06] the context window, we we do see a
- [35:08] degradation in like performance, both
- [35:10] like raw like latency, but also like
- [35:13] accuracy. Um, it's sort of like you end
- [35:15] up with like a needle in a haststack
- [35:17] problem and we observe that. So, a
- [35:20] couple things that we do, uh, we keep
- [35:23] the context like the basic thing is just
- [35:25] keep the context as minimal as possible.
- [35:26] like don't put stuff in the context
- [35:28] window unless essentially the users
- [35:30] explicitly ask for it to be there. Um
- [35:33] and then we do things like on the search
- [35:37] side uh you know within like the
- [35:40] internal notion workspace there's just
- [35:42] like an enormous amount of data and so
- [35:45] if I were to ask what's the New York
- [35:47] Wi-Fi password I could get like
- [35:50] megabytes of content like if I were to
- [35:52] do just like really really basic search.
- [35:55] So our search infrastructure is very
- [35:57] smart. Um we do that vector search, we
- [36:01] rerank things and then we have like a
- [36:04] cut off point and then we'll only return
- [36:05] that content and then we can summarize
- [36:07] that content with another LLM so that
- [36:10] only the necessary information that was
- [36:12] asked for is presented as context. Um
- [36:15] and then another thing that we do is
- [36:17] regularly like compact or compress your
- [36:20] transcript. So if you're ever conversing
- [36:22] with your your agent and we start
- [36:26] busting the context window, we can start
- [36:28] kind of chunking and compressing um
- [36:31] older parts of your transcript which
- [36:33] which is itself is sometimes errorprone
- [36:36] like that's like a lossy thing. We're
- [36:38] essentially like doing a a lossy
- [36:42] compression of your past convers
- [36:44] conversation and so sometimes that
- [36:45] doesn't work as well and and that's
- [36:47] something we're trying to improve now.
- [36:48] what what what's the sweet spot on like
- [36:51] so you know just to get into some
- [36:53] specifics I what's sort of a what do you
- [36:56] see we know that context when you know
- [36:58] can go out to hundreds of thousands if
- [37:00] not millions of tokens now what do you
- [37:03] guys see as like this is the sweet spot
- [37:05] where we're putting enough context in
- [37:07] there versus we're not over stuffing it
- [37:10] and also costing you a lot of money
- [37:12] right
- [37:15] we see probably probably in the 100 to
- [37:20] 150,000 token limit is like kind of the
- [37:24] sweet spot, right? I I I mean I would
- [37:26] say less context is better. Um like we
- [37:30] don't want to just fill it up with
- [37:32] fluff. Um and we we do actively try to
- [37:35] avoid that, but we we've borrowed this
- [37:39] concept that we see in other like
- [37:41] especially like coding tools where you
- [37:43] can like add add context like manually.
- [37:46] Um, and so using this in notion feels
- [37:49] pretty natural. You can just like
- [37:50] appment mention a page, a database, a
- [37:53] person, um, or whatever. Or you could
- [37:55] even just like drop in links, um, to
- [37:57] things that are on the web. And then the
- [37:59] agent will then pull in whatever that
- [38:02] content is as context. Um, but for
- [38:04] example, with things like databases, you
- [38:07] could have a database with like 100,000
- [38:09] pages in it, and we would not want to
- [38:11] put that into the context window because
- [38:13] it's going to be giant. um it's going to
- [38:15] nerf the models like next respon next
- [38:18] response. So we'll do things like
- [38:21] present the like highle view of the
- [38:24] database and some metadata about it like
- [38:27] here's the the columns that they have
- [38:30] and then here's maybe like the first
- [38:31] three pages that we see and then we have
- [38:35] um probably one of our most important
- [38:37] tools is our like view tool where you
- [38:40] can view the database, you can view
- [38:43] pages within the database and so we'll
- [38:45] present like the database to the agent
- [38:47] and be like here's just some snippets
- [38:50] about like what's in it and there's
- [38:51] maybe 10,000 pages in it and here's the
- [38:55] tools that you can use to like query it
- [38:57] or view more things into it. And so we
- [39:00] give the agent essentially these tools
- [39:02] that if it wants to dig deeper and
- [39:04] deeper it can um but we don't like
- [39:07] present too much information up front
- [39:09] where it like gets confused.
- [39:12] Ryan, you you started talking about
- [39:14] tools and wondering how much how much of
- [39:18] that is a key part of this when Sam and
- [39:21] I have been talking with with a number
- [39:22] of other companies um you know big you
- [39:26] know large enterprise companies pretty
- [39:27] sophisticated
- [39:29] um domain areas whether it's in banking
- [39:32] or or health or legal right Lexus Nexus
- [39:37] but we we there's a lot of domain
- [39:39] expertise and so they tend to get into
- [39:42] training models, fine-tuning models,
- [39:44] having, you know, uh, teacher student
- [39:48] uh, relationships, a lot of pretty
- [39:50] sophisticated stuff. Sounds like you
- [39:52] you've kind of
- [39:53] >> decided not to go down that path,
- [39:56] >> but really have the models reasoning
- [39:58] over as much data as possible and then
- [40:00] working with things like tools. Is it is
- [40:03] is that right? Would you would you would
- [40:05] you agree with that? Maybe can you can
- [40:07] you provide some context around how
- [40:08] important the tool side is? That's
- [40:11] exactly right. Um the tools are
- [40:14] essentially what makes the notion agent
- [40:18] what it is. Um the entire the entire
- [40:23] loop of our agent is we give it some
- [40:26] basic um documentation essentially about
- [40:29] what notion is um and what the user is
- [40:32] currently doing. So, we include like
- [40:34] what page you're on so that if somebody
- [40:36] was like, um, fix my typos in this page,
- [40:40] the agent will know what like this page
- [40:43] is. Um, and then we just give it a list
- [40:47] of tools uh with instructions and
- [40:50] documentation and we let it rip. We just
- [40:53] let it pick the tools that it thinks is
- [40:55] most appropriate. And our engineering
- [40:58] team um spends a lot of time trying to
- [41:02] keep these tools as simple as possible.
- [41:05] Um cuz again if we were to
- [41:08] you know in the the MCP world you might
- [41:11] have like thousands of tools and modules
- [41:14] and things and the agent has to like
- [41:16] search through all of that stuff and
- [41:18] pick the most effective one. Um, and so
- [41:20] we're trying to be really careful about
- [41:22] every new tool or even new like tool
- [41:25] input or parameter that like it's as
- [41:28] minimal and as clear as possible. Like
- [41:32] for example, we never want to have like
- [41:34] overlapping purpose that I could create
- [41:37] a database say um with three different
- [41:41] tools because then the agent has to like
- [41:43] reason about like okay well I'm on a
- [41:45] page should I create a database over
- [41:47] here and then move it? should I create a
- [41:49] database in line and then like set it up
- [41:51] like those can just really confuse it.
- [41:53] Um and in the cases that we do have sort
- [41:56] of like overlapping um functionality we
- [41:59] then like provide instructions about uh
- [42:02] in this scenario you would prefer this
- [42:04] one. These are kind of like fshot
- [42:06] examples. In this example you would use
- [42:08] this tool. In this example you would use
- [42:10] that tool. Um just to give it a couple
- [42:12] hints about how to use these things. So,
- [42:15] so I'm really curious on that, right?
- [42:17] That we're coming up on the sort of one
- [42:19] year first birthday of MCP, right? As
- [42:23] we're recording this now, it's just
- [42:24] around the corner. I you Notion was one
- [42:27] of the companies that jumped into MCP
- [42:29] very early. I you know, and and made not
- [42:32] only were people sort of making
- [42:34] third-party uh you know, MCPs, but
- [42:36] Notion themselves decided to make the
- [42:38] MCP. Um and I use it with the Claude
- [42:41] app. I I love that. I I'm really
- [42:43] curious. Did that give you a lot of
- [42:46] lessons that you then sort of took into
- [42:50] uh you know building out these agents
- [42:52] internally and then also how how much do
- [42:55] your internal tools match what is sort
- [42:57] of you know you're exposing as an
- [42:59] external MCP?
- [43:02] Yeah, we the the fun fact is that like
- [43:05] every tool almost every tool in our MCP
- [43:08] uh uses the same tool like almost
- [43:11] literally the same tools that our notion
- [43:13] AI uses. Um I I think our MCP also has
- [43:19] it does more basically than our like
- [43:22] internal notion AI does. Can do more
- [43:24] things with like uh comments and stuff.
- [43:26] Um but all like the core tools the
- [43:28] things that you can do with databases
- [43:30] and pages it's all it's all shared. Um
- [43:34] and there was a lot of did you learn
- [43:36] from like watching what everyone was use
- [43:38] like what were the was the most popular
- [43:40] MCP uh you know sort of tool or function
- [43:43] in there and did did that sort of
- [43:45] dictate or at least help in designing
- [43:47] the actual notion 3.0 agents?
- [43:51] >> Um it it did and it didn't. uh we
- [43:56] the audience for like our notion AI and
- [43:59] then our notion MCP uh isn't like
- [44:04] perfectly overlapped like MCP is is a
- [44:06] more technical tool like it is you
- [44:10] really I mean one you need to know what
- [44:11] MCP is uh I could not describe to my mom
- [44:14] what MCP is so you like
- [44:16] >> you've already kind of like split your
- [44:19] your audience um on MCP so like that was
- [44:22] one thing uh we were deliberating with
- [44:26] like notion AI is like maybe this should
- [44:28] just be MCP um but I think that the
- [44:31] barrier to entry there is a little
- [44:34] steeper um and there's a lot of people
- [44:36] there's students you know there's my mom
- [44:39] there's like there's people that use
- [44:41] notion that don't want to have to think
- [44:43] about like the setup and the
- [44:45] configuration um and then there's power
- [44:47] users uh you know I I use it with cloud
- [44:50] code and and codecs myself like the
- [44:51] notion MCP and it's like phenomenal
- [44:54] Um, but we need to build like a product
- [44:57] that can work for like the everyday
- [45:00] Notion user as well. And so we did keep
- [45:04] that in mind. And I think what was great
- [45:05] is we saw what worked really well on the
- [45:08] Notion MCP and we adopted some of those
- [45:10] best practices. And then like um I was
- [45:13] talking about the page and markdown
- [45:15] stuff with our Notion AI. We we were
- [45:18] able to innovate on that front and then
- [45:20] share that back to the Notion MCP. um
- [45:23] and then make the Notion MCP better. And
- [45:25] so our our teams uh that work on Notion
- [45:28] AI and the Notion MCP, we collaborate
- [45:30] pretty tightly um and are constantly
- [45:33] sharing things that we're learning back
- [45:35] and forth um about like what people want
- [45:38] from these different products uh and how
- [45:40] they're using them, what works well,
- [45:41] what doesn't work well. This series is
- [45:44] presented by Outshift, Cisco's emerging
- [45:46] tech incubation engine and driver of the
- [45:49] internet of agents, an open

- [46:05] Ryan. So, so again, so you joined in
- [46:07] January and led what you called this
- [46:10] scrappy tiger team to build this agent.
- [46:13] Um, you know, and maybe we could come
- [46:15] back to MCP here, but um, you know,
- [46:18] going back,
- [46:20] >> how did you iterate and go from
- [46:23] exploration to finding that internal
- [46:26] product market fit
- [46:27] >> where where people couldn't stop using
- [46:29] the tool?
- [46:30] >> Um, even you know, even when it was
- [46:33] buggy. uh you know and it sounded like
- [46:35] it was internal first and I want to get
- [46:37] to then maybe some data points about how
- [46:39] it was used externally and maybe you
- [46:42] know h how people are using the MCP but
- [46:44] can you talk a little bit about that
- [46:46] product market fit?
- [46:48] We almost have this like unspoken rule
- [46:50] about product development here that um
- [46:54] you know we're we're big users of like
- [46:56] internal features, you know, like dog
- [46:58] fooding. Um and anytime we have an idea
- [47:02] or a feature that is exciting,
- [47:06] we have to convince ourselves first. Um
- [47:10] we don't want to just go out to users
- [47:12] with some half-baked idea and like run
- [47:14] an AB test and then like look at the
- [47:16] data. Um, I think there's other like
- [47:20] products that that works for, but here
- [47:22] at Notion, we're like we're pretty
- [47:24] design focused. Uh, we are very critical
- [47:28] of our own product. And so we really
- [47:31] need to like be have conviction that the
- [47:34] thing um is good before we start
- [47:36] releasing it. And so when we were
- [47:38] working on notion AI um like when I
- [47:42] first joined we were doing all this sort
- [47:43] of more advanced very technical stuff
- [47:46] and we were finding it hard to get like
- [47:48] product market fit internally. We found
- [47:50] sparks of it. We found some people that
- [47:52] were like super fans of what we were
- [47:53] working on. Um and then for a lot of
- [47:56] people they were just like man this is
- [47:58] this is really complicated. It's really
- [48:00] slow. Sometimes it works. uh when it
- [48:03] breaks I'm like stuck and I'm like
- [48:06] having to look at like generated code
- [48:08] and like I I can't do that. Like I don't
- [48:10] write code. And then people were just
- [48:13] like, you know, kind of hitting like
- [48:14] dead ends and we were like that's not a
- [48:16] good sign. And so we did a couple revs
- [48:21] on the way it worked and we found like
- [48:25] an early version of this like aentic
- [48:27] loop and when we shipped it internally
- [48:29] all of a sudden all these people who
- [48:31] were like maybe on the fence about like
- [48:34] changing all the the AI features were
- [48:38] like oh I I need this like I need this
- [48:41] to work and like honestly because like
- [48:44] we're so prototypy like it was very hack
- [48:46] act together. It was slow. It was buggy.
- [48:49] And like the moment for us was when we
- [48:52] started getting all these bug reports.
- [48:55] And it's like not good that we had like
- [48:58] bugs and like things we needed to
- [48:59] improve, but the volume of people who
- [49:02] were like, "Oh, I need this fixed so
- [49:05] that I can like um you know, do like do
- [49:09] more revisions on my um product review
- [49:12] or like people were just like coming to
- [49:15] us and it's that feeling of of when the
- [49:18] product is like being pulled out of you
- [49:21] rather than you trying to like push what
- [49:23] the product should be. And like people
- [49:25] were just coming and saying like, "Oh,
- [49:27] the uh agent is not good at using this
- [49:30] block type or I wish it could like do
- [49:33] more advanced querying on the database
- [49:35] or the search results aren't like super
- [49:37] accurate." Um like one one example of
- [49:40] this near like the last mile of us
- [49:43] shipping the agent is we had an engineer
- [49:46] who was like, "I really wish I could
- [49:48] like customize
- [49:50] my own agent." And he had this idea
- [49:54] where he was like, "What if we already
- [49:56] have pages within notion? What if I just
- [50:00] like made a dedicated page that is like
- [50:03] the quote unquote personality of my
- [50:06] agent?" And he just like built it,
- [50:08] hacked it together, and like I I will
- [50:11] admit I like used this or like I I saw
- [50:14] us talking about it and I was like, "Ah,
- [50:16] I don't know. Seems like kind of like a
- [50:17] scrappy idea." And then I like used the
- [50:20] early prototype and I was like, "Oh my
- [50:22] god, this is so cool." I could influence
- [50:25] the style and the tone. I could even put
- [50:27] in like little snippets that's like when
- [50:29] I ask you to do X, you do Y. And then
- [50:32] all of a sudden, I'm like in my agent
- [50:33] and without like any other keystrokes, I
- [50:35] can be like do X and it just like does
- [50:38] Y. And then it was like, oh my god, this
- [50:41] is this is very cool. And it like
- [50:43] unlocks this like possibility. But like
- [50:45] yeah for for us we really we found that
- [50:48] spark and then we went through the
- [50:49] traditional
- [50:51] um like product development where we
- [50:53] brought in some like early adopters and
- [50:55] asking for feedback and working really
- [50:57] tightly with them and making sure that
- [50:59] the the agent was solving problems for
- [51:01] them. And the more and more we expanded
- [51:03] our testing the more people were like
- [51:04] just pulling the product out of us. Um
- [51:07] and we knew like from that moment really
- [51:10] early on that we like had something. Um,
- [51:13] and and to be honest, I like I do not
- [51:16] know
- [51:18] how I would ever use notion like without
- [51:20] this feature. And that's like me being
- [51:22] like a user. And and that is to me like
- [51:25] the most important thing is that I am
- [51:27] like fully convinced that this is like a
- [51:30] a worthwhile thing to build.
- [51:33] >> Yeah. Ryan is is there uh it's sounds
- [51:36] like it was kind of a steady with very
- [51:38] early realization realization that there
- [51:40] was some traction right as you mentioned
- [51:43] um I think eval are very important
- [51:46] >> a lot of companies talk about the
- [51:48] importance of eval right for their
- [51:50] specific domain hey what do the
- [51:53] benchmarks say what you know what are
- [51:56] the metrics say but you're saying hey
- [51:58] dog fooding was essentially a big part
- [52:00] of your evals actually the vibe I've you
- [52:03] know this the sorts of things that
- [52:05] you're you're doing personally this
- [52:07] engineer that you refer to was uh that
- [52:09] that that did this crazy thing um that
- [52:12] then became super cool was was was it
- [52:16] pretty much kind of the steady
- [52:17] acceleration or was there any I guess
- [52:19] I'm curious if it was any single
- [52:22] particular breakthrough on on that um
- [52:26] that tra trajectory that you know
- [52:28] looking back um you you can point to as
- [52:31] as as a real breakthrough. through
- [52:33] through those bugs, through those
- [52:34] issues.
- [52:36] >> I I think it was really the um
- [52:40] like the markdown stuff. Uh when we
- [52:44] shipped that internally, it just the
- [52:47] writing the the way the model could
- [52:49] write got so much better. Um not only
- [52:53] just like write but like reason. Uh it
- [52:56] was just so much so much simpler um for
- [52:59] the model to be able to work. And then I
- [53:01] think maybe also our like uh our web
- [53:05] tooling um being able to like fetch
- [53:07] contents of a website, search the
- [53:09] internet um and just kind of like seeing
- [53:13] all of those pieces come together and
- [53:15] may maybe like a really good example is
- [53:18] when we had one of our first moments
- [53:20] where we saw the agent effectively chain
- [53:23] all of these tool calls together. So to
- [53:26] be able to like read the current page
- [53:27] that I'm on um go and search the
- [53:31] internet uh for you know some subject
- [53:33] that I'm that I'm maybe I'm researching
- [53:36] something and then say like create a
- [53:38] database fill out all the properties
- [53:41] create views and then populate the
- [53:43] database like essentially in one shot
- [53:45] you know being able to ask it like read
- [53:46] this page do some research on the
- [53:48] internet and then set up like a task
- [53:51] board for me to like work on and just
- [53:53] seeing it like scaffold hold all of that
- [53:56] and get it set up for you without you
- [53:58] like having to do all this work bouncing
- [54:01] between context tools um and whatever
- [54:04] was Yeah, it was just kind of like
- [54:06] mind-blowing at first.
- [54:08] >> Ryan, I'm really curious. Okay, so you
- [54:10] get this product market fit moment and
- [54:12] my guess is that you've also already
- [54:14] sort of seen that in your career at
- [54:16] Instagram with certain features or
- [54:18] things like that, right? So it becomes
- [54:20] really clear like you talked about
- [54:22] suddenly people are pulling the product
- [54:23] out of you rather than you trying to
- [54:25] push it onto them. Um where do you go
- [54:28] from here with that? So clearly you've
- [54:30] got something that's working really
- [54:32] well. My guess is you're now being
- [54:34] bombarded with like you know 500 things
- [54:37] of people saying hey but I also want X
- [54:40] and Y and Z and you know all these sorts
- [54:43] of things. How do you sort of how do you
- [54:45] sort of clarify that you know like the
- [54:48] the whole sort of curation aspect of
- [54:51] sort of saying yeah no no no okay we're
- [54:53] just going to focus on this or we're
- [54:54] just going to nail these key features
- [54:59] that is incredibly challenging um
- [55:02] because yeah we have uh a really diverse
- [55:06] population of users from like I was
- [55:09] saying from students to parents uh
- [55:12] people running their home office or like
- [55:15] a church on notion to Fortune 500
- [55:18] companies um that are running uh their
- [55:22] projects and knowledge base and whatnot
- [55:24] on notion. Um and so that is hard to
- [55:28] figure out like what to do because
- [55:29] you've got the the requests from those
- [55:31] different um levels of customer are are
- [55:34] wildly different. Um so we have to do a
- [55:38] little bit of constant like rep
- [55:40] prioritizing uh within there. Um and
- [55:43] then internally we have ideas uh things
- [55:46] that we want to try, things that we want
- [55:48] to experiment and we certainly don't
- [55:51] want to ignore innovation. You know, one
- [55:54] thing that we're constantly doing, we
- [55:56] have a a group of folks here who are on
- [55:59] like the bleeding edge of AI research um
- [56:02] and technology. constantly following
- [56:04] what the frontier labs are doing and
- [56:06] releasing and talking about so that we
- [56:08] are prepared uh when new ideas and new
- [56:12] paradigms come around. We don't want to
- [56:15] be left behind. We want to take
- [56:17] advantage of new things and at least try
- [56:19] them and see how it fits within notion.
- [56:21] We also have to listen to our customers
- [56:23] um and figure out what they need. Uh but
- [56:27] it is a challenge. I mean, one of the
- [56:29] things that we're trying to be really
- [56:30] careful about is like,
- [56:33] you know what what's the saying that if
- [56:35] all you have is a hammer, everything
- [56:37] looks like a nail or whatever. And when
- [56:40] people ask for new features, it's like,
- [56:42] boy, we could just like add a tool to
- [56:45] the model or to our agent and let it do
- [56:47] that. Um, and that to me is a little bit
- [56:51] of a slippery slope because the more
- [56:53] tools that we add, the more decisions
- [56:56] and the more options um, the model has
- [56:59] to make. I mean, it's just the same way
- [57:01] as like us. Like when I go to a
- [57:03] restaurant, one of my biggest pet peeves
- [57:05] is when I go to like a restaurant and
- [57:07] they give me like the Cheesecake Factory
- [57:09] menu where it's like, here's 20 pages of
- [57:11] like food that you could order. And I'm
- [57:13] like gh what do I what do I actually
- [57:16] want? My ideal is like I go to a place
- [57:18] and it's like here's four dishes and you
- [57:20] get to pick. They're all excellent, but
- [57:21] you have to pick between those four. And
- [57:23] I'm like perfect. I know I will have a
- [57:25] great time. So that's like the way we
- [57:27] want to design our tools is like we want
- [57:28] the uh the very like uh curated menu. Um
- [57:33] so we have to be really careful of that.
- [57:34] But we also, you know, don't want to
- [57:35] limit the functionality of the agent. Um
- [57:38] like something we're working on right
- [57:39] now, we just released the ability for
- [57:41] the agent to read comments that are
- [57:43] within pages or or databases. um which
- [57:46] we didn't launch with initially and it
- [57:49] was probably our most requested feature
- [57:51] and so that one made sense because so
- [57:53] many people were asking for it that that
- [57:55] pull of the product. Um but then it
- [57:58] comes to other more like nuance stuff
- [57:59] and perhaps it's a job better suited for
- [58:03] MCP. Um, so if there's a more technical
- [58:06] advanced feature that people need, maybe
- [58:08] we can like folks on our support team
- [58:11] can work with that customer to figure
- [58:13] out how to solve their problem without
- [58:15] necessarily adding a tool. Um, I will
- [58:18] say like currently our biggest focus is
- [58:22] like reliability and performance. Um,
- [58:26] notion is a very complicated
- [58:29] uh uh the like structure in blocks and
- [58:32] databases. It's very complicated for the
- [58:34] agent. So we have to give the agent lots
- [58:36] of instructions and lots of
- [58:38] documentation. We have to uh we we have
- [58:41] like different models have like
- [58:44] different layers or levels of like
- [58:46] thinking that you can give it. And we're
- [58:48] on like the higher level of reasoning
- [58:50] and thinking whenever we're calling
- [58:52] OpenAI or anthropic and that can feel
- [58:54] slow sometimes when you're just like fix
- [58:57] this typo and it's sitting there for
- [58:59] like 10 seconds like thinking about how
- [59:01] to do that. So, we're trying to figure
- [59:03] out ways to make this feel a lot
- [59:05] snappier, a lot lighter. Um, and then
- [59:08] and then we're also working on custom
- [59:10] agents, um, which is not fully shipped
- [59:13] yet, but that is also built on our
- [59:15] entire agentic loop. And so, making sure
- [59:18] that that works, that's performant. Um,
- [59:21] that that is a whole other suite of um
- [59:25] complexities and things to to worry
- [59:27] about. Um, but it's showing immense
- [59:29] promise.
- [59:31] Yeah, Ryan, the the reliance on on tools
- [59:34] is a big one, and I'm thinking about our
- [59:36] listeners here who are probably thinking
- [59:38] through, okay, how best to do it. I
- [59:40] could definitely relate to the confusion
- [59:42] that we we keep hearing that agents have
- [59:44] with a long list of tools. Um,
- [59:48] you know, I I you know, some there's
- [59:50] there's a a Mediterranean place in not
- [59:53] far where where you know, I can walk in
- [59:54] and okay, you got to choose the protein,
- [59:56] you got to choose the carb, you got to
- [59:57] choose this. Or you don't have to do
- [59:59] that choosing. you could do this or you
- [60:01] could do that and it's like um and and
- [60:03] so I think agents are going to be
- [60:06] smarter than probably me but but you
- [60:08] still have that confusion. So, so, so
- [60:09] I'm wondering
- [60:11] are you talked about performance being a
- [60:13] big one in terms of ranking
- [60:16] >> I I think on on on the tool side what
- [60:18] tools you use. You can't just add
- [60:20] another tool. Can you talk a little bit
- [60:22] about maybe what tools
- [60:24] >> are emerging
- [60:26] as as big ones or what what bucket tools
- [60:29] are emerging or what classification or
- [60:32] other practices are big?
- [60:36] >> Yeah. Um,
- [60:40] our our page tool is still probably like
- [60:43] the most used um to both like read and
- [60:46] write to pages. Uh, and because notion
- [60:49] has I can't remember how many like
- [60:51] different block types we have, but it's
- [60:52] like it's so many. It's like over a
- [60:55] hundred I think. Um, each of those tools
- [60:58] has to be like hand maintained on like
- [61:01] how we represent it to the model and
- [61:03] then how the model can like write back
- [61:05] to it. Um, so that's hard. We we got to
- [61:07] go through the laundry list of all these
- [61:09] things and make sure they work. Um, so
- [61:11] we spend a lot of time doing that
- [61:12] because it's like the most used tool.
- [61:15] Um, and then we have our databases that
- [61:18] uh we allow people to query them uh
- [61:21] generate them. They can um add views to
- [61:24] them. Um, and our views can be pretty
- [61:27] complicated. If you've ever been in like
- [61:29] uh chart views options in notion,
- [61:31] there's all the different um types of
- [61:34] charts that you can display and then the
- [61:36] colors and the formatting um things that
- [61:38] you show and don't show. We want to
- [61:40] represent all of that to the agent um
- [61:43] reasonably so that it can like work with
- [61:44] that. Um so we go yeah we spend a lot of
- [61:47] time just kind of doing the like here's
- [61:49] all the things that you can do in
- [61:50] notion. Let's make sure that the agent
- [61:52] can do it reasonably well. And then sort
- [61:56] of like finding the balance of like if
- [61:59] we let it do too much, it's like more
- [62:01] mistakes that it can make. It's more
- [62:03] confused that it can get. So we have to
- [62:05] be like pretty careful of that. So I I'm
- [62:08] I'm really kind of curious. Right.
- [62:10] you're you you've got all these you've
- [62:12] got these in-house sort of tools and
- [62:14] stuff like that that you're building yet
- [62:17] you're you're using uh these you know
- [62:20] models from anthropic from open AI and
- [62:23] stuff like that at the same time they
- [62:26] are kind of looking at all these
- [62:27] products like notion and thinking like
- [62:30] oh we could also have that tool we could
- [62:32] also do that kind of thing so you've
- [62:34] really got this kind of friendnemy thing
- [62:36] right where you're you're kind of
- [62:38] friends with them on one sense, but did
- [62:42] you, you know, you got to feel at times
- [62:43] like that you've got a target on your
- [62:45] back that perhaps, you know, Anthropic
- [62:48] wants to come after the enterprise area
- [62:50] of notion. Uh, you know, OpenAI wants to
- [62:53] come after the consumer side of that.
- [62:55] How do you guys think about that?
- [62:58] >> We have we have I I'll start by saying
- [63:00] we have really great relationships with
- [63:02] with the um the Frontier Labs. Um yeah,
- [63:06] they do look to us as like product
- [63:08] people. Um and then obviously we look to
- [63:11] them as like the AI experts. Um you know
- [63:14] I see both anthropic and open AI are are
- [63:17] innovating on the product side alongside
- [63:18] their models and um building things in
- [63:22] the B2B space, the consumer space uh and
- [63:25] whatnot. And I think that we don't
- [63:29] necessarily want to go toe-to-toe with
- [63:32] these huge labs. I mean they're
- [63:33] extremely talented. They're wellunded.
- [63:36] Um we believe our unique
- [63:40] value is this collaborative space. Um
- [63:45] this is in the like soul of notion and
- [63:47] it's how notion works. Um and so that is
- [63:52] I think what we are leaning into the
- [63:53] most. You know we do not want like we're
- [63:56] not going to build a notion version of
- [63:57] like chat GPT. Um that doesn't really
- [64:00] make a whole lot of sense. We want
- [64:01] notion AI to be like our our our
- [64:05] marketing um push is like that. These
- [64:07] are teammates and we really want them to
- [64:09] feel like teammates where um I can bring
- [64:12] them into my workspace and either
- [64:14] automate work or multitask things um or
- [64:18] bring like expertise uh to a task um or
- [64:22] to my work and less so the yeah like
- [64:26] we're not going to make a notion
- [64:28] generated video app or something um that
- [64:31] wouldn't be too good. I guess more what
- [64:33] I meant though was like do you feel the
- [64:35] pressure to sort of develop your own
- [64:37] secret source that is not model
- [64:41] dependent that's sort of like stuff that
- [64:44] they would have to think gee how are
- [64:46] they doing that with our models we're
- [64:48] not sure right kind of thing I you know
- [64:51] like on one hand obviously they can you
- [64:53] know sort of get a sense of what traffic
- [64:55] is coming into their models I but it
- [64:57] sounds like your whole middleware is
- [64:59] really interesting in in that sort of
- [65:00] sense and I'm curious just like do you
- [65:03] you know is there an active conversation
- [65:05] going on of like hey why don't we try
- [65:08] and develop something that's you know
- [65:09] really unique to us.
- [65:12] Yeah, I that that is mostly how we
- [65:16] approached this. Um like one thing, you
- [65:19] know, it reminds me of of my time at
- [65:22] Instagram.
- [65:24] We were pretty weary to like vendor lock
- [65:27] in. Um there there of course would be
- [65:31] tools and products and APIs that would
- [65:34] be Android specific and Apple specific
- [65:37] and we would like to take advantage of
- [65:38] those things but we would never want to
- [65:42] build the core product around a single
- [65:45] operating systems capability and the way
- [65:48] that applies to notion is um
- [65:52] I think the the different vendors have
- [65:54] like their own kind of like here here's
- [65:56] a good example like uh text replacement
- [65:59] tools. um or they're now even coming out
- [66:02] with like their own sort of like agentic
- [66:03] tools and like we don't want to overfit
- [66:08] to one like vendor's um API because uh
- [66:13] that could change um the other vendor
- [66:15] could come out with like a model that is
- [66:17] like pretty exciting and we want to like
- [66:19] experiment with that but if we've like
- [66:21] overfitit for um you know the way one
- [66:25] model behaves or a tool that it has
- [66:27] we'll kind of end our like have cornered
- [66:29] ourselves
- [66:30] Um, and I think the other thing that
- [66:33] we've learned over the last year is that
- [66:36] like with all this like discovery that
- [66:38] that the models work really well with
- [66:40] Markdown, it's like we just kind of want
- [66:42] to figure out and learn what these
- [66:46] models are really good at and then
- [66:48] figure out how to apply them to notion
- [66:51] um and to the problems that our users
- [66:53] have within notion and the way like the
- [66:55] notion system works. Um, and so yeah,
- [66:59] spending we spend almost all of our
- [67:01] engineering effort on that middleware
- [67:03] and you know our our AI like researchers
- [67:06] and experts are the ones that are
- [67:08] figuring out like oh this model is like
- [67:10] now becoming really good at this new
- [67:12] technology or this new technique and
- [67:14] then we'll find a way to like apply that
- [67:16] into notion and in a very like notion
- [67:18] specific way. Do do you uh you know as
- [67:21] you go through this do you sort of
- [67:22] actively plot and plan that okay part of
- [67:26] our agent will go for this model first
- [67:28] then we'll go for another model. So we
- [67:30] never let any vendor actually see the
- [67:32] full sort of you know what's going on
- [67:35] there.
- [67:36] No, no, we're not. We're we're we're
- [67:40] pretty open um both about like product
- [67:43] and like what we're trying to do with
- [67:46] the models because um the Frontier Labs
- [67:48] are also trying to push the boundaries
- [67:50] as well. Um and so we're frequently
- [67:51] sharing like learnings about things that
- [67:53] are working or not working. Um it really
- [67:56] does feel like a rising tides lift all
- [67:58] boats um sort of moment.
- [68:01] >> So So Ryan, I I'm hearing you
- [68:06] I I I want to follow up though on, you
- [68:09] know, Sam Alman's been big about, hey,
- [68:12] watch out. Don't don't develop in the
- [68:15] road map of OpenAI because we're going
- [68:17] to steamroll you, right? Don't build a
- [68:21] rapper that can easily be wiped out by
- [68:24] us. And when I saw them roll out OpenAI
- [68:28] recently, you the apps in in ChatGpt,
- [68:32] >> right? Now within my chat GPT feed, I
- [68:35] can I can link to all these specialists,
- [68:38] right? So and you noticed in their their
- [68:40] launch, they have these specialist these
- [68:43] domain experts. So So travel was a big
- [68:44] one, right? Expedia, Booking.com, you
- [68:47] could go straight to your your accounts
- [68:49] from OpenAI and fiddle fiddle around
- [68:51] there.
- [68:52] >> Um
- [68:53] >> for housing, you know, Zillow, uh
- [68:56] Corsera, right? You you you could do
- [68:59] banking. All those folks feel safe,
- [69:02] right? The the those folks with the
- [69:05] domain expertise, it's very different.
- [69:07] Um book I I I think you you notion
- [69:11] sounds like it's very dangerously in the
- [69:14] road map recently and I'm not sure if
- [69:16] it's obviously on purpose. I think this
- [69:19] this stuff obviously came about
- [69:21] relatively recently where Sam is is now
- [69:23] talking more about being an assistant,
- [69:26] right? He's talking about even a
- [69:28] hardware device.
- [69:29] And so maybe it wasn't by design, but it
- [69:32] feels like it's becoming awfully close.
- [69:35] Um, so are you sure you have something,
- [69:37] you know, maybe I don't know if you can
- [69:39] articulate what the differentiation is
- [69:42] because it certainly feels like they
- [69:43] have that connection tissue that they
- [69:46] want to drive me anywhere. And you know,
- [69:48] maybe second, I would just say, do you
- [69:50] feel like OpenAI has provided a clear
- [69:53] road map clear enough for folks like
- [69:55] you? like what it and I'm just wondering
- [69:58] what what what you're taking away from
- [70:00] that.
- [70:01] >> I definitely don't have any insight into
- [70:04] OpenAI's roadmap. They launched new
- [70:06] stuff that I'm like you were doing what
- [70:09] uh all the time. Um which I think is
- [70:11] cool. I I think it's very cool to watch.
- [70:14] Um I I do think to me notions in a very
- [70:21] sweet spot where like our expertise is
- [70:27] the like multi-per
- [70:29] real-time collaborative workspace. Um
- [70:33] and I don't have a doubt in my mind that
- [70:36] um other folks and and notion is not the
- [70:38] only like multiplayer um B2B workspace
- [70:42] app out there either. But I and I don't
- [70:44] have any doubt in my mind that open or
- [70:46] anthropic could build something could
- [70:47] build something pretty great. Um but
- [70:50] notion has over a decade of of uh
- [70:53] experience in this space. Um and and not
- [70:56] just
- [70:58] on product and engineering but also like
- [71:00] trust with companies and customers and
- [71:03] users. Um and so we've developed quite a
- [71:06] lot of expertise um in that. And you
- [71:09] know we we don't necessarily want to
- [71:11] like reframe
- [71:13] notion as only AI like we to us we are
- [71:18] using AI to like solve these
- [71:21] collaborative issues for people. Um and
- [71:24] so yeah I I don't think that I would see
- [71:28] us ever going like toeto toe with open
- [71:31] AAI. Um
- [71:33] who knows this industry changes like
- [71:36] every other day. I I'm kind of like
- [71:38] chuckling because when you were talking
- [71:40] about plans because we were recently
- [71:42] having an internal conversation about
- [71:44] like uh somebody asked me like what our
- [71:46] AI team's roadmap is and I'm like I can
- [71:49] tell you what we're doing until like
- [71:50] Friday
- [71:52] and that's like it uh and that's very
- [71:54] much like by design because
- [71:55] opportunities come up so fast new models
- [71:58] drop um new prototypes show promise um
- [72:02] new problems pop up with our
- [72:04] infrastructure and so we're kind of like
- [72:06] constantly ly pivoting and chasing um
- [72:09] those new things. So yeah, it's like
- [72:11] we're always kind of like on our heels
- [72:13] and like ready to pivot and react.
- [72:16] >> Ryan, it good point. Um is there one
- [72:20] specific area you feel relatively
- [72:22] confident that you just
- [72:25] you you think you you have a dominant
- [72:30] position in that's defensible
- [72:33] in this overall area of context?
- [72:36] I I think that our like search and
- [72:39] connection is like world class. Um it is
- [72:44] by far what I use Notion AI for. Um, I
- [72:48] love being able to like write documents,
- [72:50] edit documents, and manage databases,
- [72:52] but on its own, I think it would be like
- [72:56] a a nice feature, but when I can combine
- [72:58] that with the context and retrieval that
- [73:01] we've got um in addition to the like
- [73:04] within notion, like the years and years
- [73:06] of content and information from all of
- [73:08] these different uh connections that we
- [73:10] use like really sort of like um is the
- [73:16] Yeah. the the the value to me like for
- [73:19] example uh when I onboarded here it was
- [73:22] like one of the best onboardings ever
- [73:25] because instead of having to have an
- [73:26] onboarding buddy that I'm like
- [73:27] constantly peppering with questions I
- [73:29] just am like asking notion AI how do I
- [73:32] do this where do I find this or like why
- [73:34] was this decision made and it can go
- [73:36] back like five years in time and be like
- [73:38] here is where like you know Ivan wanted
- [73:41] to try feature X and then we shipped it
- [73:43] or whatever um and that's like that's
- [73:46] like so useful. Uh, and also like that
- [73:49] information doesn't always have to be
- [73:52] crystallized within notion. That
- [73:54] conversation could have happened in
- [73:55] Slack 2 years ago and notion would just
- [73:58] whoop go and find it. It really just
- [73:59] comes down to like to me like product
- [74:04] and taste and execution. Um, and it's
- [74:07] ultimately like why I joined Notion with
- [74:10] my co-founders because we like love the
- [74:13] product. Um, we love the like level of
- [74:15] taste. It doesn't feel um like we're
- [74:18] just cramming every feature that we
- [74:20] could possibly think of. We're very very
- [74:22] critical and have a very high bar for um
- [74:25] what we actually ship and how polished
- [74:26] it is.
- [74:27] >> That definitely seems to be a theme
- [74:29] across a lot of the the uh sort of
- [74:32] people who are adopting AI is that this
- [74:34] really is about curation about taste and
- [74:38] and and you know I think notion is
- [74:40] definitely seen as a taste maker. I'm
- [74:42] curious sort of now as we're sort of
- [74:44] starting to wind up, what advice do you
- [74:47] have for other companies that are sort
- [74:50] of getting into this, you know, that are
- [74:52] in that position of where they Yeah,
- [74:55] maybe they've got some kind of, you
- [74:56] know, data, some kind of context.
- [74:58] They're trying to provide better
- [75:00] products for their their customers.
- [75:02] They're, you know, they're a bit
- [75:04] intimidated by Open AI, sort of saying
- [75:06] that they're going to get steamrololled.
- [75:09] What's your sort of take on it? and sort
- [75:10] of, you know, if someone was sort of
- [75:12] sitting next to you in the bar and they
- [75:14] tell you, "Hey, uh, we're just starting
- [75:16] out, like, you know, give us give us the
- [75:19] secret sauce."
- [75:21] Um,
- [75:25] a couple things that come to mind
- [75:30] is like the first is just you just got
- [75:32] to channel the model. Like just do use
- [75:35] the APIs the way they were meant to be
- [75:37] used. Don't try to be fancy. Don't try
- [75:39] to over complicate it. Use plain
- [75:42] English. Um, you know, like like I
- [75:44] mentioned, if I could if a a new hire if
- [75:47] I could present my prompt or my
- [75:49] instructions to a new hireer and they
- [75:51] can generally understand it, that's like
- [75:53] what you should be shooting for. Just
- [75:55] like keep it very simple. Um, what's
- [75:58] nice is that that sort of maps to just
- [76:00] like traditional engineering best
- [76:02] practices, too. I've seen abstractions
- [76:05] and frameworks and code that are just
- [76:07] like PhD level complexity and like my
- [76:10] eyes like glaze over when I'm trying to
- [76:13] like read, you know, some code or
- [76:15] whatever. And that's like a good kind of
- [76:18] like smell test of like maybe
- [76:20] something's actually overly complex. Um,
- [76:23] and the same goes for working with LLMs,
- [76:26] like just keep it simple. Um, and then
- [76:32] I think the other part is like you just
- [76:34] got to try stuff. Um, I would I would
- [76:37] also recommend like don't invest in
- [76:41] evals really soon. Like just be very
- [76:43] vibey. Like just try things and feel it.
- [76:47] Um, to me evals are once you've got a
- [76:50] sense of like product market fit and you
- [76:52] want to like hone in on the accuracy,
- [76:55] the quality, the latency or whatever.
- [76:58] Um, I would not start with like eval to
- [77:01] do exploratory product work. Um, like
- [77:03] pre-product market fit. I would not
- [77:06] bother with evals. I would just very
- [77:07] much like yeah use vibes.
- [77:11] >> Interesting. So what to get that product
- [77:13] market fit? What do you sort of
- [77:16] like how okay if we if you're you're
- [77:18] sort of encouraging people not to use
- [77:20] eval because that's it's kind of
- [77:21] interesting because a lot of other
- [77:22] people we're listening to are sort of
- [77:24] saying evales eval.
- [77:26] But you make a really nice point that
- [77:28] the emails probably don't help that much
- [77:30] when you're exploring what what are you
- [77:33] know what are the key sort of things for
- [77:35] exploring
- [77:38] >> it's kind of just classic product
- [77:40] development to me like how much are
- [77:43] people using your thing you know
- [77:45] retention retention retention retention
- [77:47] if people are constantly using your AI
- [77:50] feature you've nailed it um and I'm a
- [77:54] big believer in like build things that
- [77:56] solve your problems. Now, that's hard.
- [77:59] It depends on the space, you know, if
- [78:00] I'm building a um AI feature for
- [78:04] lawyers. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know
- [78:06] how any of that works. Uh so, that would
- [78:09] be really challenging for me. And and
- [78:11] that's more of like a career life lesson
- [78:12] is like I feel like people should work
- [78:14] in spaces that they're super passionate
- [78:16] and knowledgeable about. Um and so like
- [78:18] for me, working at Notion's great
- [78:20] because I like productivity tools. um I
- [78:22] like being productive and so I'm gonna
- [78:24] build tools that like do that for me. Um
- [78:27] but yeah, that's it. I don't think
- [78:30] there's anything necessarily unique
- [78:32] about um you know, the other thing I
- [78:34] would mention is like really early on in
- [78:36] product development is like don't worry
- [78:37] about costs.
- [78:39] Don't worry about how much you're
- [78:40] spending uh or like on AI development,
- [78:44] don't worry about how cost effective
- [78:47] your AI feature is yet. Like those
- [78:49] things can be optimized later. Um, and
- [78:52] especially if you've built something
- [78:53] that is incredibly valuable to people
- [78:55] that you should like have a a pricing
- [78:58] structure that reflects that value as
- [79:00] well. Um, that doesn't put you
- [79:01] underwater. Um, I early in in our
- [79:05] previous startup, I think we were like
- [79:07] really precious about how cost effective
- [79:11] like our LLM features were. And it's
- [79:14] like, well, 20 people use it, so who
- [79:17] cares?
- [79:19] You got to earn the right to like
- [79:20] optimize the price and the margins,
- [79:23] right? Over the summer, we we had our
- [79:25] our our flagship conference and Andrew
- [79:28] Ing came to speak and he was really big
- [79:31] on this this notion of being fast,
- [79:34] right? That we we needed over the
- [79:36] summer, I think we still were in this
- [79:39] kind of environment that speed was
- [79:41] necessary. We, you know, we're early. Um
- [79:44] and multiple other people chimed in in
- [79:46] agreement to the point where he was
- [79:49] saying, "Yeah, you know, eval
- [79:52] um even guard rails, uh security, uh you
- [79:56] got to prototype, get some things out
- [79:57] there, then kind of build that
- [79:59] redundancy." But I want to come back to
- [80:01] something I think you've mentioned a
- [80:03] couple times, which is this culture,
- [80:05] right? And you talked about being an
- [80:07] Instagram and Kev Kevin Zystrom was was
- [80:09] I think became famous for you know just
- [80:12] perfecting the you know the icon
- [80:14] corners. You know there were many um uh
- [80:18] you know sharing apps and photo sharing
- [80:20] image sharing apps at the time but they
- [80:22] broke through that taste that you're
- [80:24] talking about and you talked about
- [80:25] notion actually not shipping throwing
- [80:28] tools as fa as fast as possible uh
- [80:31] slowing down perhaps and actually caring
- [80:33] about what you put out there. Are we
- [80:34] still in the in the era of speed? I
- [80:37] mean, kind of moving forward or are we
- [80:40] in the era of slowing down?
- [80:43] >> I think we're still in the era of speed.
- [80:45] Um, and it's it is challenging to
- [80:49] uh be like crafts people that have a
- [80:52] really high bar for polish and then be
- [80:53] in a space that like is moving at
- [80:56] breakneck speed. Um, so you you you have
- [81:00] for us we have to straddle the line of
- [81:03] holding a high bar while not like
- [81:06] slowing ourselves down. Um, and that
- [81:09] that's pretty hard. And so sometimes we
- [81:11] will have to be a little bit more
- [81:12] tolerant of um, you know, bugs,
- [81:16] glitches, like whatever. You we're we're
- [81:18] never going to willingly like ship a
- [81:20] bug. Uh but sometimes if the agent has
- [81:24] we have this like a bit of air cover
- [81:26] that like AI is non-deterministic and so
- [81:30] like there is a I think a there's a
- [81:34] higher level of like tolerance for it
- [81:36] being like quirky and weird
- [81:38] than there would be in like traditional
- [81:40] software you know like the the Instagram
- [81:43] point is a great example like we had
- [81:45] such a high bar because we could control
- [81:47] every single pixel of it. um with AI we
- [81:49] we can't control as much. Um and even
- [81:52] though Frontier Labs like don't
- [81:53] necessarily know how these things work
- [81:54] under the hood. Um and so that that
- [81:57] gives us a bit of air cover to be a
- [81:58] little experimental. Um but at the same
- [82:01] time there are some principles that we
- [82:03] just hold really dearly. Uh like one is
- [82:06] permissions. Um we care very much about
- [82:08] how uh we respect your permissions and
- [82:11] permissions of content and people within
- [82:13] your workspace. You know we never want
- [82:14] to leak content. We want to be um aware
- [82:18] of uh the dangers of fetching content
- [82:21] from the internet. Um if the agent is
- [82:24] ever changing content on your behalf, we
- [82:27] want you to have a one-click way to undo
- [82:29] that and restore what it did or or see
- [82:31] what it did. So, you know, there's some
- [82:34] places that we could be a little faster
- [82:35] and looser. And then there's some areas
- [82:37] where we're like, nope, like this is a
- [82:39] red line that we're not going to cross.
- [82:40] You know, we never want to make people's
- [82:42] content um irreoverable.
- [82:45] um or leaked.
- [82:48] >> Where do you go from here?
- [82:51] Well, like you've done you've done a
- [82:52] bunch of stuff. It's been a really
- [82:54] interesting conversation. I'm I'm really
- [82:55] kind of curious to see and and not just
- [82:57] just for you and for personally for
- [82:59] Notion, but like where do you think as
- [83:01] an industry we sort of go from here?
- [83:06] >> Yeah, it's it's a pretty weird time. Um
- [83:09] I don't know what things are going to
- [83:10] look like in in a year, let alone like
- [83:13] five years. Do you think like everyone's
- [83:15] been talking about or you know I guess
- [83:17] earlier in the year everyone was talking
- [83:18] about 2025 being the year of agents.
- [83:21] It's kind of you know I think Kapathy
- [83:23] mentioned that it's the kind of probably
- [83:24] the decade of agents which seems to make
- [83:26] more sense to me. I you know is the
- [83:29] future agents right? Do you sort of
- [83:31] foresee that like uh a lot of this stuff
- [83:34] is going to be agents rolling out?
- [83:36] >> We're experimenting a lot with obviously
- [83:39] with agents. Um, I think a custom agent
- [83:42] bet is very exciting because this adds
- [83:45] another layer of like autonomy um to our
- [83:49] like notion agents and so we're we're
- [83:51] really excited about that. Um, I I agree
- [83:54] with Carpathy. I think it's it's a
- [83:56] decade of agents. Um, I think his point
- [84:00] about like every nine of reliability
- [84:03] taking enormous like the same amount of
- [84:06] effort I think is completely true. Um,
- [84:08] I've seen it firsthand with uh what
- [84:11] we're doing on notion AI where we've got
- [84:13] things like pretty stable, but that last
- [84:15] like few percent uh you know in some
- [84:18] tool error rate or whatever, it's really
- [84:20] hard to nail because it's not there is
- [84:23] no like silver bullet. It is a bunch of
- [84:25] small things that you have to fix. Uh
- [84:27] and then a new model will come out and
- [84:29] have its own quirks and like things that
- [84:31] you have to patch. Um so that is like
- [84:33] really challenging but but fun. It's
- [84:35] like a fun challenge. What I'm most
- [84:38] excited about is like extending model
- [84:42] capabilities and modality. I am not
- [84:47] wholly convinced that the future is chat
- [84:50] boxes. Um I think there's a lot more
- [84:53] interesting stuff going on. I'm I'm
- [84:54] really excited about all these companies
- [84:57] building like AI browsers, not just, you
- [85:00] know, a popup in the side where I can
- [85:01] like chat with the web page, but
- [85:03] automation and um like more context
- [85:06] aware about like what I'm doing. You
- [85:08] know, AI is essentially like with you
- [85:10] and available at all time and has more
- [85:12] and more and more context. So I think
- [85:14] that that's for us at at notion what
- [85:17] we're um investing a lot in right now is
- [85:20] like the more context the more
- [85:22] information the better the AI is going
- [85:24] to perform. So like how can we give it
- [85:26] more context.
- [85:28] >> Ryan this has been a fantastic
- [85:31] conversation.
- [85:33] Thank you. Thank you very much for
- [85:35] sharing. You you did intrigue me though
- [85:37] you know by ending on customized agents.
- [85:39] Can you can you just give us you know
- [85:41] maybe a preview or an outline of the
- [85:43] types of things that are coming down
- [85:45] moving forward? You know, is this maybe
- [85:46] more relevant for the enterprise or or
- [85:49] are you talking about more for the
- [85:50] assistant in terms of the the assistant
- [85:52] for the individual?
- [85:54] >> I I do think it solves problems for
- [85:56] both. Um I would say that
- [86:00] enterprises and and well just companies
- [86:03] will probably see the immediate value
- [86:05] from custom agents. Like for instance,
- [86:08] we're using it to power um our IT
- [86:11] departments, our help desk departments.
- [86:13] It's helping our our sales groups, our
- [86:15] customer support groups. For an example,
- [86:17] we have like an IT channel in Slack. And
- [86:20] you can ask a question about, you know,
- [86:21] oh, my computer's acting up or I need a
- [86:24] new um cable for my monitor. And our bot
- [86:28] will reply either and pull information
- [86:30] like from our help docs from previous uh
- [86:33] requests. and then if it can't answer
- [86:35] your question, it'll file a ticket for
- [86:37] our IT team to then go look into.
- [86:39] They'll look into it and then then
- [86:40] handle your thing where previously that
- [86:42] was like either a person um in Slack
- [86:45] constantly monitoring that stuff or
- [86:46] another like uh app or service that we
- [86:49] had to manage that was like kind of
- [86:51] doing that and not as deeply integrated
- [86:53] as as Notion is. But I I've also seen a
- [86:56] bunch of great like personal
- [86:58] productivity uses for it. Um, something
- [87:01] that I started doing is I have a custom
- [87:04] agent that is like my work journal. Um,
- [87:06] and so at the end of every single day,
- [87:09] it like looks across my Slack channels,
- [87:12] my pull requests, um, my documents. Um,
- [87:16] you know, we have we have meeting notes
- [87:18] within notion, so it can see all the
- [87:19] meetings that I was in. It sucks up all
- [87:21] of that context and it writes like a
- [87:24] little 10point blurb about like here's
- [87:26] the things Ryan did today. And then it
- [87:28] stuffs that into a database that becomes
- [87:29] like my my journal. Um I like kind of
- [87:32] journaling. I like kind of keeping tabs
- [87:34] on what I do. I can be so busy that I
- [87:36] like forget all the minutiae of like the
- [87:39] things we did and accomplished. Um and
- [87:42] so now instead of me having to take time
- [87:44] and like go and write that every single
- [87:46] day, I just have a custom agent that
- [87:48] plops a new page uh into this database
- [87:50] and I can review it uh if I want or not.
- [87:53] Um or I can do even like more meta, you
- [87:56] know, summarization over the uh the
- [87:58] month of November. What all did I do?
- [88:01] And all that information is there.
- [88:03] >> Fascinating. All right. The whole
- [88:05] conversation has been very fascinating.
- [88:07] Or Ryan, thank you so much for for
- [88:08] joining us on the pod. Um we certainly
- [88:11] learned a lot. Uh it's very interesting
- [88:13] to hear what a startup like Notion is
- [88:16] doing. uh and and thank you for being so
- [88:19] open about, you know, a number of the
- [88:21] different topics of how you've actually
- [88:23] sort of built this experience. Thank you
- [88:25] very much.
- [88:27] >> Thank you so much for having me. This
- [88:28] was a blast. Thank you, Ryan.
