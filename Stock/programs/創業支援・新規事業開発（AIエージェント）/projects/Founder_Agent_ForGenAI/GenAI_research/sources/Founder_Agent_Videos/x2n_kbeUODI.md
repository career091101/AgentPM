- [00:00] The Elon Musk vers Sam Alman saga
- [00:03] continues and now we have a brand new
- [00:06] deposition that just dropped featuring
- [00:09] Ilia Sudskver, former founder of OpenAI,
- [00:13] one of the leading minds in artificial
- [00:16] intelligence. And there are so many
- [00:19] interesting bits from this 62page
- [00:22] document which I read in full. I
- [00:24] highlighted the most interesting bits
- [00:25] and I'm going to break it all down for
- [00:27] you. The cast of characters include, of
- [00:29] course, Sam Alman, Ilia Sudskver, Mera
- [00:32] Morati, former CTO. We have Greg
- [00:34] Brockman, the former Open AI board,
- [00:37] plotting against Sam Alman, and Daario
- [00:40] Amade, current founder of Anthropic,
- [00:43] former employee of Open AAI. There's so
- [00:47] much going on. I'm going to read through
- [00:48] it. Let's get into it. And this video is
- [00:50] brought to you by Recraft. More on them
- [00:52] later. Now remember the context for this
- [00:55] deposition is Elon Musk suing Sam Alman
- [01:00] and that's because Elon Musk thinks it
- [01:02] is illegal the way that Sam Alman took a
- [01:05] nonprofit took all of these donations
- [01:07] built one of the most important
- [01:09] companies of all time and has
- [01:11] effectively converted it into a
- [01:14] for-profit company. As of last week, we
- [01:16] now know note that the nonprofit
- [01:18] controls the public benefit corporation,
- [01:20] which still is a for-profit company, but
- [01:23] it is more missiondriven than just
- [01:25] shareholder value. So, let me paint the
- [01:27] picture. This is a deposition between
- [01:29] one set of lawyers and Ilia Suskver and
- [01:32] his [snorts] lawyers. This deposition
- [01:34] occurred on October 1st, 2025, just
- [01:37] about a month ago. And oh boy, it is
- [01:40] wild. So, a few things to note. First,
- [01:43] this was recorded at the Kulie LLP
- [01:46] offices. Kulie is one of the most
- [01:48] prominent law firms in Silicon Valley
- [01:50] and the plaintiff Elon Musk versus the
- [01:53] defendant Samuel Alman at all. And there
- [01:56] are also appearances from Microsoft
- [01:58] which is fascinating although it's
- [02:00] barely mentioned. So again, this is Elon
- [02:02] Musk for Sam Alman, but it's almost
- [02:04] entirely about Ilia Suskver, Sam Alman's
- [02:07] firing, the board dynamics prior to that
- [02:09] firing, and the subsequent fallout. So,
- [02:12] the first thing we learned is that Ilia
- [02:14] Suskver put together a 52page memo in
- [02:18] preparation of attempting to get Sam
- [02:21] Alman fired from Open AI. There was a
- [02:24] long history of dissatisfaction from
- [02:26] Ilia towards Sam Alman about how Sam
- [02:28] Alman was running the company
- [02:30] specifically and this became public
- [02:32] information at the time of the firing
- [02:34] just about 2 years ago that Sam Alman
- [02:36] exhibits a consistent pattern of lying
- [02:39] undermining his execs and pitting his
- [02:41] execs against one another. And now back
- [02:43] to the 52-page memo. I'm going to tell
- [02:46] you what was actually in the memo and
- [02:48] how it came to be, but more on that in a
- [02:50] minute. And the first line of
- [02:51] questioning between lawyers and Ilia
- [02:53] Suskvert, that is not Ily's lawyers,
- [02:55] those were the opposing lawyers, was
- [02:57] about the 52-page document and who he
- [03:00] sent it to and why he didn't send it to
- [03:02] Sam Alman. I think it's obvious why, but
- [03:04] listen to his words. Why didn't you send
- [03:06] it to the entire board? It being the
- [03:09] document, the board being the entire
- [03:10] board of directors for OpenAI. Because
- [03:12] we were having the discussions with the
- [03:14] independent directors only. Independent
- [03:17] meaning not aligned with Sam Alman, I
- [03:19] believe. and why didn't you send it to
- [03:21] Sam Alman? Because I felt that had he
- [03:23] become aware of these discussions, he
- [03:26] would just find a way to make them
- [03:28] disappear. So, at this point, right
- [03:31] around the time of the firing, I susver
- [03:34] already had a pretty bad relationship
- [03:37] with Sam Alman. He was already kind of
- [03:39] secretly putting together this document
- [03:42] in hopes that he would be able to
- [03:44] convince the board to fire Sam Alman,
- [03:46] which he actually was able to do. Now
- [03:48] obviously you remember about a week
- [03:50] later Sam Alman came back but the
- [03:52] initial firing did happen and he also
- [03:54] thought that if Sam Alman found out
- [03:56] about the discussions he would actually
- [03:59] just make them disappear and more on
- [04:01] that later because Ilia Suskover really
- [04:04] believes that Sam Alman and other CEOs
- [04:07] are killers. They are very political.
- [04:10] They are cutthroat and they're willing
- [04:12] to do whatever it takes to seek and
- [04:14] control power. Now, interestingly, the
- [04:17] board actually asked Ilia to prepare the
- [04:20] document. So, it's kind of weird. It's a
- [04:23] little confusing how that went down, but
- [04:24] listen to this. The context for this
- [04:26] document is that the independent board
- [04:28] members asked me to prepare it and I
- [04:30] did. And I was pretty careful. Most of
- [04:32] the screenshots that I have that I most
- [04:35] or all I don't remember, I get them from
- [04:38] Mera Morati. And so it seems Mera
- [04:41] Marotti was also very much aligned with
- [04:44] Ilia in that Sam Alman had to go. She
- [04:46] was capturing screenshots of chat
- [04:49] interactions, text, Slack, whatever it
- [04:51] is, as evidence, as a breadcrumb trail
- [04:54] to showing that Sam Alman is a poor
- [04:56] leader. Now, I'm not giving my opinion
- [04:59] on any of this. I'm just trying to
- [05:01] convey what was actually going on and
- [05:04] provide a little bit of context. it made
- [05:06] sense to include them, them being the
- [05:08] screenshots, in order to paint a picture
- [05:10] from a large number of small pieces of
- [05:13] evidence or items. And so, they're
- [05:15] putting together evidence that he's a
- [05:16] bad leader. But what does that actually
- [05:18] mean? Are you still wasting time jumping
- [05:20] between your AI chats and design canvas?
- [05:23] Recraft's new chat mode ends that for
- [05:26] good. So, imagine this. You generate a
- [05:28] logo, drag it into the chat, and say,
- [05:30] "Create a full brand kit from this.
- [05:32] social posts, posters, mockups, all in
- [05:36] minutes. And at the end, you have a
- [05:37] consistent set of full brand assets that
- [05:40] you can use immediately. This is the
- [05:41] magic of Recraft's new chat mode. It's a
- [05:44] powerful AI chat assistant within
- [05:46] infinite canvas. Start in chat for
- [05:49] lightning fast exploration and then
- [05:51] switch to canvas for pixel perfect
- [05:53] control. No more switching between apps.
- [05:55] The entire creative process from first
- [05:58] prompt to final assets happens now in
- [06:00] one place. So, stop just generating
- [06:03] images. Start creating with precision.
- [06:06] Join the beta chat mode weight list
- [06:07] today. Link in the description. Let them
- [06:10] know I sent you. ReCraft has been a
- [06:12] phenomenal partner. Now, back to the
- [06:13] video. Now, which independent directors
- [06:16] asked you to prepare your memo? Exhibit
- [06:18] 19? It was most likely Adam D'Angelo.
- [06:22] Who is Adam D'Angelo? So, first a little
- [06:25] bit of background. He was educated at
- [06:27] Philip's Extor Academy, the same academy
- [06:29] that Mark Zuckerberg went to. He joined
- [06:31] Facebook shortly after its launch,
- [06:33] served as its chief technology officer
- [06:35] from 2006 to 2008 and as vice president
- [06:39] of engineering until 2008. Then in 2009,
- [06:42] he co-founded Kora, which is a Q&A
- [06:45] website very popular in Silicon Valley
- [06:47] and he has been serving as CEO ever
- [06:50] since. And he has served on the board of
- [06:52] OpenAI since 2018. And kind of
- [06:57] surprisingly, Adam D'Angelo is still on
- [07:00] the board of OpenAI. Even after most of
- [07:03] the board that went against Sam Alman
- [07:05] was fired, he's still there. And so Ilia
- [07:08] continues and says, "I had discussions
- [07:11] with the independent board members
- [07:12] discussing Sam Alman." And after having
- [07:15] these discussions, either Adam or the
- [07:17] three of them together, I don't
- [07:18] remember, have asked me to collect
- [07:19] supporting screenshots. And the three of
- [07:21] them together, Adam D'Angelo, Helen
- [07:23] Toner, and Tasha Macaulay. And I already
- [07:26] explained who Adam D'Angelo is, but
- [07:27] let's go over the other two. Now, this
- [07:30] is Helen Toner. She is an Australianborn
- [07:33] AI researcher. And she, especially at
- [07:36] the time of the Sam Alman firing, was
- [07:39] quite vocal about it. She was a main
- [07:41] player in his firing. She actually ended
- [07:44] up writing kind of a negative piece
- [07:46] about OpenAI while still being on the
- [07:48] board at OpenAI. Then we have Tasha
- [07:51] Macaulay, another OpenAI board member at
- [07:53] the time, a tech entrepreneur and
- [07:56] robot/AI
- [07:58] specialist. And kind of interesting
- [08:00] tidbit, she's married to Joseph Gordon
- [08:02] Levit. Now, back to the point, why are
- [08:06] people aligning against Sam Alman? Why
- [08:08] did they think he was a bad leader?
- [08:09] Well, according to this document,
- [08:11] according to other documents that have
- [08:14] come out since the firing, here is the
- [08:16] crux of the issue. Sam exhibits a
- [08:18] consistent pattern of lying, undermining
- [08:20] his execs and pitting his execs against
- [08:22] one another. And the lawyer says, "That
- [08:25] was clearly your view at the time." And
- [08:28] Ilia says, "Correct." So he continues to
- [08:30] ask, "And did you want them to take
- [08:32] action over what you wrote?" What you
- [08:34] wrote being that memo? And I wanted them
- [08:37] to become aware of it, but my opinion
- [08:39] was that action was appropriate. And
- [08:42] what action did you think was
- [08:43] appropriate? Termination. Ilia thought
- [08:46] Sam needed to be out. And Ilia was very
- [08:49] worried about that memo getting out and
- [08:52] leaking. And the lawyer continues, "And
- [08:54] you sent it using a form of disappearing
- [08:56] email. Is that right?" Yes. Why? Because
- [08:58] I was worried that those memos will
- [09:00] somehow leak. But it wasn't all against
- [09:03] Sam Alman. He also had similar thoughts
- [09:05] of Greg Brockman. So lawyer, you drafted
- [09:08] a similar memo that was aritical of Greg
- [09:11] Brockman. Correct? Yes. Then they
- [09:14] transition to talking about Ilia's
- [09:16] equity in OpenAI. So, were you concerned
- [09:19] about losing your equity in OpenAI at
- [09:21] the time? Ilia says, "I was not
- [09:23] concerned as he probably shouldn't have
- [09:25] been because that is pretty ironclad
- [09:26] equity that he has." Then he asks, "How
- [09:29] much was your equity worth?" So, what
- [09:31] what was your equity at OpenAI worth at
- [09:33] the time? What did you think it was
- [09:35] worth? Then the lawyers go back and
- [09:37] forth as to why that's relevant for this
- [09:40] deposition. Ultimately, he doesn't end
- [09:42] up answering the question directly. Then
- [09:44] the questioning goes towards why the
- [09:46] board eventually after the firing
- [09:48] decided to resign and reinstate Sam
- [09:51] Alman. And just the quick history
- [09:53] lesson, they fired him and just about a
- [09:55] week later he was back and the board had
- [09:57] resigned and he was basically in
- [09:59] control. He being Sam Alman. So right
- [10:01] now my view is that with very few
- [10:03] exceptions most likely a person who is
- [10:06] going to be in charge is going to be
- [10:08] very good with the way of power and it
- [10:11] will be a lot like choosing between
- [10:13] different politicians. What does Ilia
- [10:15] actually mean? Well, he means Sam Alman
- [10:18] has sharp elbows and is willing to use
- [10:21] them. He is saying Sam Alman is
- [10:24] extremely good at the political nature
- [10:26] of power seeking. And he continues, "The
- [10:30] person in charge of what?" A gi Ilia
- [10:35] continues, "That's how the world seems
- [10:36] to work. I think it's not impossible,
- [10:38] but I think it's very hard for someone
- [10:40] who would be described as a saint to
- [10:43] make it." Basically, if you're a good
- [10:45] guy, you're not really going to be in
- [10:48] these powerful positions at these
- [10:50] companies. I think it's worth trying. I
- [10:52] just think it's it's like choosing
- [10:54] between different politicians. who is
- [10:56] going to be the head of the state. Then
- [10:58] they continue and talk about the removal
- [11:00] of Sam Alman and the process therein. So
- [11:02] from the lawyer and in reviewing the
- [11:04] steps that preceded the removal, do you
- [11:06] think that process was correct? Ilia
- [11:09] says, "One thing I could say is that the
- [11:11] process was rushed. Obviously, they
- [11:14] fumbled firing Sam Olman. He came back
- [11:16] and was more powerful than ever. But
- [11:18] why?" Well, the process was rushed. Why
- [11:21] was it rushed? Well, I think it was rush
- [11:23] because the board was inexperienced.
- [11:26] Andy continues and the lawyer says,
- [11:28] "Inexperienced in what?" In board
- [11:30] matters. Then they get into this line of
- [11:32] questioning around how familiar Tasha
- [11:34] and Helen, the two board members who
- [11:36] wanted to fire Sam Alman, were with
- [11:39] OpenAI's day-to-day operations. And it's
- [11:42] wild because if you remember, Helen said
- [11:44] she found out about Chacht initially
- [11:47] from Twitter. She didn't even know about
- [11:49] it. Watch this clip. When chatbt came
- [11:52] out, November 2022, the board was not
- [11:54] informed in advance about that. We
- [11:56] learned about chatbt on Twitter.
- [11:58] >> And here's a clip of Helen Toner
- [12:00] explaining why she wanted Sam Alman out
- [12:03] of OpenAI.
- [12:04] >> Sam didn't inform the board that he
- [12:06] owned the OpenAI Startup Fund, even
- [12:09] though he, you know, constantly was
- [12:11] claiming to be an independent board
- [12:13] member with no financial interest in the
- [12:14] company. Um on multiple occasions he
- [12:18] gave us inaccurate information about the
- [12:21] small number of formal safety processes
- [12:23] that the company did have in place
- [12:25] meaning that it was you know basically
- [12:26] impossible for the board to know how
- [12:28] well those safety processes were working
- [12:30] or what might need to change. And then
- [12:32] you know a last example that I can share
- [12:34] because it's been very widely reported
- [12:36] relates to this paper that I wrote um
- [12:38] which has been you know I think way
- [12:39] overplayed in the press. The problem was
- [12:41] that after the paper came out, Sam
- [12:43] started lying to other board members in
- [12:45] order to try and push me off the board.
- [12:47] Um, so it was another example that just
- [12:49] like really damaged our ability to trust
- [12:51] him. And
- [12:51] >> so, back to the deposition. How familiar
- [12:53] did Tasha and Helen appear to you to be
- [12:56] with OpenAI's operations? Ilia, they
- [12:59] seem to have some familiarity, but it's
- [13:01] hard for me to assess. Did you view them
- [13:03] as experts in AI safety? Then his
- [13:06] council objects. They go back and forth
- [13:09] as to why this is all relevant to the
- [13:12] Musk vers Sam Alman lawsuit. Remember
- [13:14] this is what it's all about. Then do you
- [13:16] recall in October 2023 Helen Toner
- [13:18] publishing an article criticizing open
- [13:20] AI? He says I do recall. What do you
- [13:23] recall about that? I don't recall the
- [13:25] nature of the criticism but I recall it
- [13:27] was praising anthropic. I found it a
- [13:30] strange thing for her to do. Did you
- [13:32] think it was appropriate for her to do
- [13:34] as a board member of Open AI? I thought
- [13:37] it was not far from obviously
- [13:40] inappropriate. So he's saying yes, it
- [13:42] was inappropriate. Then after the
- [13:44] firing, after Helen Toner was removed
- [13:46] from the board, here is the line of
- [13:49] questioning. Did you support removing
- [13:51] Helen Toner from the board or asking her
- [13:53] to leave? Ilia, at least at one point, I
- [13:56] expressed support. Remember, Ilia stayed
- [13:59] on after this whole fiasco happened for
- [14:02] a while actually and he supported at
- [14:05] least for a time being getting rid of
- [14:07] Helen Toner. Now, here is something
- [14:10] crazy. Helen Toner believed that if Sam
- [14:14] Alman leaving OpenAI caused Open AI to
- [14:17] get destroyed, that would still be in
- [14:20] line with Open AI's mission. So she was
- [14:23] willing to kill the company and still
- [14:25] believed it was the right thing to do.
- [14:28] So after Sam was removed, do you recall
- [14:30] Hail and Toner telling employees that
- [14:32] allowing the company to be destroyed
- [14:33] would be consistent with the mission?
- [14:35] Aaliyah, I do recall. What was the
- [14:38] context of that comment? The executives,
- [14:40] it was a meeting with the board members
- [14:41] and the executive team. The executives
- [14:44] told the board that if Sam does not
- [14:46] return, then Open AI will be destroyed
- [14:49] and that's inconsistent with Open AI's
- [14:51] mission. And Helen Toner said something
- [14:54] to the effect of that it is consistent,
- [14:57] but I think she said it even more
- [14:59] directly than that. She was willing to
- [15:01] let Open AAI be destroyed. Now the
- [15:04] lawyer asked Ilia, "What do you think?
- [15:06] Do you think that was consistent?" He
- [15:08] says, "I could imagine hypothetical
- [15:10] extreme circumstances that answer would
- [15:13] be yes." But at that point in time, the
- [15:16] answer was definitely no from me. Now
- [15:18] they start asking about Sam's time at Y
- [15:21] Combinator. If you're not familiar, Y
- [15:23] Cominator is the premier accelerator in
- [15:26] Silicon Valley. They invest in thousands
- [15:29] of startups, many of which you have
- [15:31] heard of, Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase, and
- [15:35] many more. And Sam Alman went through
- [15:36] the accelerator with his own company and
- [15:38] then eventually became president of YC.
- [15:41] So the lawyer asks and you say here
- [15:44] there's reason to believe that Sam was
- [15:46] removed from YC in the past for a reason
- [15:48] similar to the one that you identify in
- [15:51] this document. And here the lawyer's
- [15:52] reading a document to Ilia Sam was
- [15:55] pushed out from YC for similar
- [15:56] behaviors. He was creating chaos,
- [15:58] starting lots of new projects, pitting
- [16:00] people against each other and thus was
- [16:02] not managing YC well. And Paul Graham
- [16:05] did actually refute this claim. So May
- [16:08] 30th, 2024, I got tired of hearing that
- [16:11] YC fired Sam. So here's what actually
- [16:14] happened. People have been claiming YC
- [16:16] fired Sam Alman. That's not true. Here's
- [16:18] what actually happened. For several
- [16:20] years, he was running both YC and Open
- [16:22] AI. But when OpenAI announced that it
- [16:24] was going to have a for-profit
- [16:26] subsidiary and that Sam was going to be
- [16:28] the CEO, we specifically Jessica, one of
- [16:31] the founders of YC, Paul Graham's wife,
- [16:33] told him that if he was going to work
- [16:36] full-time on OpenAI, we should find
- [16:37] someone else to run YC. And he agreed.
- [16:40] If he'd said that he was going to find
- [16:42] someone else to be CEO of OpenAI so that
- [16:44] he could focus 100% on YC, we'd been
- [16:47] fine with that, too. We didn't want him
- [16:50] to leave. Just choose one or the other.
- [16:52] And that's understandable and seemingly
- [16:54] continues to be the dynamic between Paul
- [16:55] Graham, YC and Sam Alman. They all seem
- [16:58] to have a very good relationship. They
- [17:00] all seem to praise Sam Alman's executive
- [17:04] ability. And Mera Marotti was the person
- [17:08] who told Ily this. So this information
- [17:10] came only from Meera. Ilia, yes. Did you
- [17:13] did you seek to verify the information
- [17:15] with Brad? that is Brad Litecap,
- [17:17] currently chief operating officer of
- [17:20] OpenAI. And Ilia says, "No, he did not
- [17:23] verify that information." And it
- [17:25] continues, "The lawyer is reading a
- [17:27] document again. Interestingly, it is my
- [17:29] understanding that Greg has was
- [17:31] essentially fired from Stripe as well."
- [17:33] Ilia says, "Yes. What was the basis for
- [17:36] that allegation?" Again, Meera told me.
- [17:39] Did you seek to verify it with Greg? No.
- [17:41] Why not? It didn't occur to me. I
- [17:43] thought that I fully believed the
- [17:45] information that Meera was giving me.
- [17:47] Then here is a section entitled pitting
- [17:50] people against each other. So the lawyer
- [17:52] says, turning to the next page, you see
- [17:54] an example that's offered is Daniela,
- [17:56] which is Daniela Amade, Daario Amade's
- [18:00] sister, also both founders and leaders
- [18:03] of Anthropic. Dianiela versus Meera. Who
- [18:07] told you that Sam pitted Dianiela
- [18:09] against Meera? Answer again. Meera.
- [18:12] Meera really was telling Ilia all of
- [18:15] these things. Now, keep in mind this may
- [18:18] have been what Meera was perceiving
- [18:20] happening. Whether it is true or not,
- [18:23] that is up for discussion. Now at a
- [18:25] certain point it becomes clear that
- [18:27] Daario wanted to be the head of research
- [18:30] at OpenAI and that is a replacement for
- [18:33] Greg Brockman and Sam Olman was not
- [18:36] making a firm decision either saying yes
- [18:38] Daario you can lead or no Greg Brockman
- [18:41] is the leader you report to him. So as
- [18:44] read Sam was not taking a firm position
- [18:46] in respect of Daario wanting to run all
- [18:48] of research at OpenAI and to have Greg
- [18:52] fired. And so, not only did Dario want
- [18:54] to run all of research, but he also
- [18:56] wanted Greg Brockman out. And Ilia says,
- [18:58] "The real problem was that, well, let me
- [19:01] just read it." My recollection of what I
- [19:03] wrote here is that I was faulting Sam
- [19:06] for not accepting or rejecting Daario's
- [19:08] conditions. Daario said, "I want to take
- [19:10] over, and here's what I need to make
- [19:12] that happen." And Sam didn't just say,
- [19:14] "Okay," or "No." He simply just let it
- [19:17] sit there. And of course, lack of
- [19:19] decision-making is oftent times worse
- [19:22] than the actual decision being made. So
- [19:24] they go on to ask, "Was Daario's
- [19:27] conditions fair to take over?" And Ilia
- [19:30] says, "I don't have precise enough
- [19:31] knowledge of Daario's conditions, but my
- [19:32] overall sense is that they were not fair
- [19:34] and that Sam should have rejected them
- [19:36] outright." And then they start to talk
- [19:38] about Yakob Pachaki as read. So this is
- [19:41] the lawyer reading a document involves
- [19:43] Sam lying, undermining Meera,
- [19:45] undermining Ilia, and pitting Yakob
- [19:48] against Ilia. Joint work with Greg and
- [19:50] YaKob. What was the lying in the episode
- [19:54] by Sam in the episode involving YaKob?
- [19:56] Ilia replies, "Sam was telling me and
- [19:58] YaKob conflicting things about the way
- [20:00] the company would be run. And just keep
- [20:03] in mind, Yaka Pachaki is currently chief
- [20:06] scientist at Open AI alongside Mark
- [20:09] Chen, who is the chief research officer.
- [20:12] And the lawyer continues to ask
- [20:14] questions to Ilia, asking him follow-up
- [20:17] questions. And I think this is really
- [20:18] funny. Ilia's lawyer says, "We're now
- [20:20] bordering on harassing the witness, and
- [20:23] I am going to shut it down." All right.
- [20:25] Then we get to a really interesting bit.
- [20:28] It turns out, and I didn't know about
- [20:30] this, I don't think this was public
- [20:32] until now, Anthropic during all of this
- [20:35] conflict, actually tried to either
- [20:39] acquire or merge with Open AI. Remember,
- [20:42] Daario had already left. He started
- [20:44] Anthropic with his sister. And now
- [20:47] during the time Sam Alman was fired, he
- [20:50] tried to merge with OpenAI. So lawyer,
- [20:54] do you know whether a proposal was made
- [20:55] around the time for OpenAI to merge with
- [20:57] Anthropic? He answers, I do know about
- [21:00] that. The lawyer says, tell me. I don't
- [21:02] I don't know whether it was Helen who
- [21:04] reached out to Anthropic or whether
- [21:06] Anthropic reached out to Helen, Helen
- [21:08] Toner from OpenAI's board, but they
- [21:10] reached out with a proposal to be merged
- [21:12] with OpenAI and take over its
- [21:14] leadership. And what ended up happening
- [21:16] with that proposal? I recall Anthropic
- [21:18] expressing their excitement about it and
- [21:20] expressing the issue, the practical
- [21:22] challenges that they would have with it.
- [21:24] And what was your response asking Ilia?
- [21:27] I was very unhappy about it. Why?
- [21:30] Because I really did not want OpenAI to
- [21:32] merge with Anthropic. Why not? I just
- [21:35] didn't want to. And then what about the
- [21:37] other board members? Were they
- [21:38] supportive? They were a lot more
- [21:40] supportive. Yes. Were all of them
- [21:42] supportive? I think at the very least
- [21:44] none were unsupportive. And then he asks
- [21:47] who was the most supportive and he says
- [21:49] Helen Toner. Then he starts asking about
- [21:52] an article that came out and who was
- [21:54] actually talking to the reporter. So as
- [21:57] read from the article, Sudskver had been
- [22:00] waiting for a moment when the board
- [22:01] dynamics would allow for Almond to be
- [22:03] replaced as the CEO. And so he asks what
- [22:06] were the dynamics you were waiting for?
- [22:08] And Ilia says that the majority of the
- [22:10] board is not obviously friendly with
- [22:12] Sam. Then he says when did that happen?
- [22:14] when someone there was a sequence of
- [22:15] rapid departures from the board for
- [22:17] different reasons. I don't remember what
- [22:18] they were. I don't remember who exactly
- [22:20] left, but that's what it's referring to.
- [22:22] Question. So, for how long have you been
- [22:24] planning to propose removal of Sam? This
- [22:27] is where it gets wild. For some time, I
- [22:31] mean, planning is the wrong word because
- [22:32] it didn't seem feasible. He didn't even
- [22:34] think it was possible. He wanted to for
- [22:36] a long time, and I'm going to tell you
- [22:37] how long, but he didn't even think it
- [22:39] was possible. He says it didn't seem
- [22:41] feasible. It was not feasible prior. So,
- [22:43] I was not planning. How long had you
- [22:45] been considering it? At least a year.
- [22:49] So, he was unhappy for a long time. And
- [22:53] after the firing, Ilia was surprised by
- [22:57] the reaction of OpenAI's employees. I
- [22:59] don't think he really understood the
- [23:01] cultural significance that Sam Alman had
- [23:05] and the morale influence Sam Alman had
- [23:08] on OpenAI's team members. So, as read
- [23:11] from an article, Suskgiver was
- [23:13] astounded. He had expected the employees
- [23:15] of OpenAI to cheer. That's cheer at Sam
- [23:17] Alman's firing. Is that true? He asks
- [23:20] Ilia. I had not expected them to cheer,
- [23:22] but I have not expected them to feel
- [23:24] strongly either way. But they did.
- [23:27] Remember, there was a whole campaign
- [23:28] where so many of OpenAI's employees were
- [23:31] posting on Twitter, OpenAI is nothing
- [23:33] without its team or something along
- [23:35] those lines. All right. Next, the
- [23:37] witness Ilia gets passed to Microsoft's
- [23:40] lawyers. Now, is it your belief that Sam
- [23:42] Alman will have a financial interest in
- [23:44] open AI someday? And remember, we just
- [23:47] found out Sam Alman continues to have
- [23:49] zero shares in Open AI. So, when he was
- [23:53] in front of Senate and said, I have no
- [23:55] financial interest in making OpenAI
- [23:58] successful. I'm already a billionaire. I
- [23:59] don't need more money. He said, hey,
- [24:01] that was a little tonedeaf, but yeah, it
- [24:03] was true and continues to be true. I
- [24:06] have no stake in these companies. Ilia
- [24:08] says, I recall reading about it in the
- [24:10] news, but I don't know how accurate it
- [24:12] is. Meaning Sam Alman having eventually
- [24:15] a stake in open AI. And then Ilia
- [24:17] Suskver ended up leaving OpenAI and
- [24:19] starting his own company, his own
- [24:21] frontier lab, Safe Super Intelligence.
- [24:24] So the lawyer asked, why did you leave?
- [24:27] Ultimately, I had a big new vision and I
- [24:29] felt it more suitable for a new company.
- [24:32] At the time, immediately prior to your
- [24:35] departure of OpenAI, did you have an
- [24:36] equity stake in the company? Yes,
- [24:39] obviously. What do you believe the value
- [24:41] of that equity stake was at the time you
- [24:43] left? And then they go back and forth
- [24:45] again saying, "Ilia should not have to
- [24:48] say what the value of that stake is
- [24:49] worth, and it's irrelevant to everything
- [24:52] else we're talking about." And of
- [24:53] course, a little bit more bickering.
- [24:55] We've heard a lot of you today, so let
- [24:56] me finish. I love that. Then they go
- [24:59] back, do you still have a financial
- [25:00] interest in OpenAI? Yes. Has the amount
- [25:03] of the interest increased or decreased
- [25:05] since you've left OpenAI? Increased. Of
- [25:08] course, it's gone up in value. So
- [25:10] apparently since he left OpenAI, he's
- [25:12] actually gotten more shares and then
- [25:13] they continue. And the shares that he
- [25:16] did get and the increasing amount of
- [25:18] shares have also increased in value. Has
- [25:20] the value of your interest in OpenAI
- [25:22] increased or decreased since you left
- [25:23] OpenAI increased? Okay, now this next
- [25:26] section is just kind of hilarious. It's
- [25:29] bickering between the two sets of
- [25:31] lawyers. And rather than me just reading
- [25:33] it, I'm going to roleplay it with Alex.
- [25:36] Be courteous and respectful.
- [25:38] >> You be courteous and respectful.
- [25:40] >> The court reporter says the court
- [25:42] reporter is noting for the record that
- [25:44] it cannot be taken due to simultaneous
- [25:46] cross talk. Once council can continue
- [25:48] with the quorum in a professional
- [25:49] manner, the record will resume. Let's
- [25:52] take five.
- [25:52] >> Yeah, don't raise your voice.
- [25:54] >> I'm tired of being told that I'm talking
- [25:56] too much.
- [25:57] >> Well, you are.
- [25:58] >> Check yourself. All right. Now, back to
- [26:01] the line of questioning. The lawyers
- [26:02] ask, Ilia, what is saved super
- [26:04] intelligence? What is the purpose of
- [26:06] that company? To do a new and different
- [26:09] kind of research. And what does that
- [26:11] mean exactly? I have a new idea of how
- [26:13] to do things and I want to try to do
- [26:15] them. Then they go on to discussing
- [26:17] who's paying Ilia's legal fees for this
- [26:20] court case. And it's interesting who is
- [26:22] paying your legal fees for this
- [26:24] objection. Then they ask again, who is
- [26:26] paying your legal fees? I I'm not sure.
- [26:29] Ilia says he's not even sure who's
- [26:31] paying for them. And have a guess, but
- [26:33] I'm not 100% sure. How did you come to
- [26:35] retain counsel? And then the lawyer says
- [26:37] I'm not going to allow him to answer
- [26:39] that question. Once again, is OpenAI
- [26:41] paying your legal fees? I think that's
- [26:44] probably the case. So, that's it. I
- [26:46] found this absolutely fascinating. I
- [26:49] loved the back and forth between the
- [26:50] lawyers. I love the new information we
- [26:52] found about this. It is seemingly
- [26:54] inevitable that we're going to have a
- [26:56] movie about what went down with OpenAI.
- [26:58] And once again, thank you to Recraft.
