## Text

- [00:00] I'm really late on this because I was
- [00:02] out of town, but Enthropic dropped a new
- [00:04] gem, a high quality coding model built
- [00:07] to power heavyduty agentic tasks. Allow
- [00:10] me to introduce Claude Opus 4.5, the
- [00:13] best coding model available. And I'm not
- [00:15] joking with that claim. The Enthropic
- [00:17] team really went to work with this
- [00:18] release cuz this new model is super
- [00:20] intelligent, efficient, and hands down
- [00:23] the best model in the world now for
- [00:25] coding agents and full computer use
- [00:27] tasks. They're also saying it's
- [00:29] meaningfully better at everyday tasks
- [00:31] like deep research, which is something I
- [00:34] personally doubt, and I'll explain later
- [00:35] on why, but it apparently works really
- [00:38] well with slides, spreadsheets, and
- [00:40] structured business workflows. Overall,
- [00:42] this model is a major step forward in
- [00:45] what AI systems can do and preview at a
- [00:48] larger shift, which is coming as to how
- [00:51] it gets things done. In terms of
- [00:54] benchmark scores, it is hitting
- [00:56] state-of-the-art on realworld software
- [00:58] engineering tests, scoring an 80.9
- [01:00] percentage on the sway bench verified
- [01:02] test, which is an insane number that
- [01:05] surpasses every other model right now,
- [01:07] including the new Gemini 3.0 Pro, as
- [01:10] well as the previous Claude Sonnet 4.5.
- [01:13] In terms of pricing, it lands at $5 per
- [01:16] 1 million input tokens and $25 per 1
- [01:19] million output tokens, which is
- [01:21] definitely on the expensive side and
- [01:23] higher than the newly released Gemini
- [01:25] 3.0. It also supports a 64K max output
- [01:29] token length as well as a 200k context
- [01:32] window, same as the other models in the
- [01:34] lineup, which is kind of unfortunate. I
- [01:36] was hoping to see a jump to a full 1
- [01:38] million context window, but we'll likely
- [01:41] see that with the 5.0 you know series
- [01:42] next year. Now in terms of benchmarks,
- [01:45] this model is outperforming every human
- [01:48] candidate on Enthropic's notorious
- [01:50] difficult 2hour performance engineering
- [01:52] take-home exam. It highlights
- [01:54] exceptional technical ability under
- [01:56] pressure and beyond coding. This model
- [01:58] is showing major gains in vision,
- [02:01] reasoning, and mathematics and achieving
- [02:03] state-of-the-art results obviously on
- [02:04] the sway bench multilingual ader polyth
- [02:08] as well as the browser comp plus
- [02:10] benchmark. It is also demonstrating
- [02:12] stronger long-term task reliability
- [02:15] scoring 29% higher than Sonnet 4.5 on
- [02:18] the vending benchmark and notably on a
- [02:21] Gentech evaluations like the T2 bench.
- [02:24] Opus 4.5 even devised a creative
- [02:27] legitimate workaround which is upgrading
- [02:30] customers cabin class first to allow
- [02:33] later flight changes and showing deeper
- [02:35] problem solving than the benchmark
- [02:37] itself expects. Now, overall, this model
- [02:40] is doing insanely well in coding
- [02:42] benchmarks over even something like the
- [02:44] Gemini 3.0 Pro, which just released,
- [02:47] which is scoring state-of-the-art on
- [02:49] every benchmark from computer use to a
- [02:51] genensic terminal coding all the way to
- [02:53] Aentic tool use. This is quite
- [02:55] impressive. Before we get started, allow
- [02:57] me to introduce today's video sponsor,
- [02:59] Web Flow AI, the all-in-one platform
- [03:02] that lets you design, build, and scale
- [03:05] digital experiences at the speed of
- [03:07] imagination. With Web Flow, you don't
- [03:10] just make websites. You build full
- [03:12] digital ecosystems from product pages to
- [03:15] entire experiences, all powered by AI.
- [03:18] You need a landing page, just describe
- [03:20] it. Web Flow's AI instantly drafts
- [03:23] structure, layouts, and content that's
- [03:25] ready to publish in minutes. And here is
- [03:28] where things get smarter. Web Flow
- [03:30] introduces AEO, which stands for answer
- [03:33] engine optimization. Think about SEO
- [03:36] 2.0, where AI helps your site stay
- [03:39] visible, accessible, and human friendly.
- [03:42] With one click, Web Flow's AI audits
- [03:45] your website, and it is going to be able
- [03:47] to suggest real-time fixes, faster load
- [03:50] times, better design balances, and
- [03:52] content that ranks across AI search
- [03:54] engines. No more endless tweaking cuz
- [03:57] the AI does the heavy lifting for you,
- [03:59] so you can focus on what actually
- [04:01] matters. What's wild is that before Web
- [04:03] Flow, this would take a full dev team.
- [04:05] Now, it's just one creator, one
- [04:07] platform, and infinite potential. With
- [04:10] Web Flow AI, you can design smarter,
- [04:12] build faster, and create digital
- [04:14] experiences that think ahead. Start
- [04:17] building today at webflow.com and bring
- [04:19] your imagination to life with the link
- [04:21] in the description below. Now, my two
- [04:23] cents after testing the Opus 4.5 isn't
- [04:27] just as a great coding model. It might
- [04:29] lack in certain areas like front-end
- [04:31] development, as Gemini 3.0 is something
- [04:33] that does better at it and while being a
- [04:36] lot more cheaper. But where it
- [04:38] absolutely shines is hard coding with
- [04:41] back-end engineering and tool-driven
- [04:43] workflows. Its ability to execute
- [04:45] multi-step agentic tasks is genuinely
- [04:48] impressive with stable, logical, and
- [04:50] reliability even without special
- [04:52] prompting or tuning. This is where in
- [04:55] this example where I'm showing this
- [04:57] video, the Cloud 4.5 Opus can complete
- [05:00] an endto-end task of doing taxes. This
- [05:03] workflow is going to be accomplished in
- [05:06] a single pass with no fine-tuning, just
- [05:08] straight reasoning and task execution at
- [05:11] 20 times the speed. The level of
- [05:13] autonomous tool use with this model plus
- [05:15] its deep technical reasoning is where
- [05:17] Opus really sets itself apart. And like
- [05:20] I mentioned about the reasoning mode
- [05:22] enabled or not, if you select the no
- [05:24] thinking mode enabled, honestly the
- [05:26] difference with thinking on isn't that
- [05:29] dramatic. The Opus 4.5 is already so
- [05:32] stable with the base model and it's so
- [05:34] confident in tool use workflows that
- [05:36] turning on chain of dot barely changes
- [05:38] the output quality. It gets slightly
- [05:41] more verbose but maybe a bit cleaner I
- [05:44] guess in the step-by-step planning but
- [05:46] the actual results are almost identical.
- [05:48] So rather than paying a bit more, I
- [05:50] believe it's better with no uh thinking
- [05:53] mode enabled in certain tasks. Not every
- [05:55] task, but in terms of the base quality
- [05:59] of this model, it is super superior in
- [06:01] comparison to other models I've seen.
- [06:03] This is where it's going to be a lot
- [06:05] cheaper with the Gentic Task where it's
- [06:07] going to save you tokens. Even though
- [06:08] it's priced super high, it's going to
- [06:10] save you a lot of money in terms of
- [06:12] using tool use efficiently rather than
- [06:14] any other model we've showcased. So, if
- [06:17] you're looking to get started with this
- [06:18] model, you can access it through
- [06:20] Claude's chatbot. But the only thing is
- [06:22] is that you're going to need Claude Pro
- [06:23] to use the Opus 4.5 directly within
- [06:26] Enthropics chatbot. You can access it
- [06:28] via API. Let's say if you do not want to
- [06:31] pay for an API, you can use Kilo code
- [06:33] because they offer a free $25 credit
- [06:36] that lets you access the models for free
- [06:39] completely with an API so that you can
- [06:41] use it within something like uh cursor
- [06:44] or within any sort of ID like VS code
- [06:47] within the kilo code extension. Another
- [06:50] way is using open router. This is
- [06:52] another option for you to access the
- [06:54] cloud opus 4.5. And the best part is is
- [06:57] that Kilo code is an open- source
- [06:59] extension. So you can click on install
- [07:01] kilo code and you can install it also
- [07:03] through the extension store by going
- [07:05] over to kilo code and downloading it.
- [07:08] And then on the left hand side you can
- [07:09] access it. But now we can start running
- [07:11] the test with the cloud opus 4.5. You
- [07:13] can select this model and start
- [07:15] generating things. So our first test is
- [07:17] actually going to be create a SAS
- [07:20] landing page with many features. This is
- [07:23] a baseline test I usually send into
- [07:25] every model to assess how well it is in
- [07:27] terms of its front-end capabilities. And
- [07:29] you can see with kilo code powered by
- [07:31] the cloud opus 4.5, it is going to work
- [07:34] on generating the SAS landing page.
- [07:37] We're looking for creative output. We're
- [07:39] looking for its capability in planning
- [07:42] the structure out as well as how
- [07:44] proficient the front-end code is for the
- [07:46] SAS landing page. Right now you can see
- [07:48] a live stream of it and it is going to
- [07:51] work on generating all the components
- [07:53] for it autonomously. And something I've
- [07:55] realized so far with the generations is
- [07:56] that it is thoroughly working on making
- [07:59] sure that each component is thoroughly
- [08:01] generated. It is uh spending a lot more
- [08:04] time in comparison to something like
- [08:06] Gemini 3.0. Even Gemini 3.0 spends a lot
- [08:09] of time but you can see the amount of
- [08:10] lines of code it worked on generating
- [08:13] for the SAS landing page. Obviously, it
- [08:15] works a lot better with a coding agent
- [08:17] like Hilo Code, but you can see that
- [08:19] there is approximately over 1,400 lines
- [08:23] of code for just this front end. And
- [08:26] it's working on all the variables and
- [08:28] generating components for it to be
- [08:30] functional. And looks like it is still
- [08:32] generating the styles CSS file. And
- [08:35] there's over, I believe, 3,000 lines of
- [08:38] code. So, you can see how much effort
- [08:41] goes into generating all the components.
- [08:46] But there we go. This is our SAS landing
- [08:49] page that it had generated. And it
- [08:51] actually looks pretty decent in my
- [08:52] opinion. There's animations. You also
- [08:54] have the cookie banner. And this is
- [08:57] overall something that it was able to
- [08:59] generate quite quickly. It added the
- [09:01] carousel for the trending companies,
- [09:03] added animations to it, which is really
- [09:04] nice. So, it was able to meticulously
- [09:06] focus on every component really well.
- [09:09] Its front-end capabilities are not the
- [09:11] best, I'll tell you that. It's not
- [09:13] better than Gemini 3.0. Maybe with
- [09:15] prompting it can get there. But you can
- [09:17] see that the small things a part of this
- [09:19] model is what makes it a proficient
- [09:22] model that you would want to use for
- [09:23] development. Overall, it did a great job
- [09:26] in my opinion with this SAS landing
- [09:27] page. I would give it a 9 out of 10
- [09:29] overall with its functionality. But with
- [09:32] this front end style, it's still the
- [09:34] basic typical AI generated uh front end
- [09:37] style, which is not horrible, but you
- [09:39] can see how interactive and how thorough
- [09:43] it was able to generate each component.
- [09:45] It just keeps going and it did overall a
- [09:48] great job. All of these small features
- [09:50] makes it perfect in my opinion. With the
- [09:52] dark mode, it looks a lot better in my
- [09:54] opinion, too. And you can see how much
- [09:56] effort it put into each component. Also,
- [09:59] another thing you'll notice is that its
- [10:01] browser use component is a lot better in
- [10:04] comparison to previous models. This is
- [10:06] where it can debug and test a lot
- [10:08] better. It's obviously going to be a lot
- [10:10] more expensive where it took $2.55 to
- [10:13] generate the SAS landing page, but in
- [10:16] terms of its overall quality and using
- [10:18] the browser use agent, it is going to be
- [10:20] really helpful in finding and testing
- [10:22] bugs. In my next test, I had requested
- [10:25] the Opus 4.5 to generate an SOG of a
- [10:29] butterfly, and this is where it did
- [10:32] this. This is incredible, guys. In my
- [10:34] opinion, this is better than the
- [10:35] generation I saw of the Gemini 3.0. It
- [10:39] was able to create a really cool looking
- [10:42] butterfly. I didn't even tell it to
- [10:44] create animations for it, but it had
- [10:46] done that on its own. And it's
- [10:47] interactive. It made sure uh all of the
- [10:50] components are symmetrical and it did a
- [10:53] great job overall in generating this.
- [10:55] Next up, I'm requesting it to create a
- [10:57] browserbased operating system. And you
- [10:59] can see that it is working on generating
- [11:02] the plan for it. Essentially, we're
- [11:04] trying to see how well it is in terms of
- [11:06] proficiently generating this application
- [11:09] and how it's able to code out all the
- [11:11] components. So, spent approximately
- [11:13] $1.70 to generate the landing page. And
- [11:16] this is essentially how it looks. Go
- [11:19] ahead and open it up. You have a loading
- [11:21] animation to start up the operating
- [11:23] system, which is absolutely awesome. We
- [11:26] can go ahead and sign in by clicking
- [11:28] enter. And there we go. This is our
- [11:30] browserbased OS, which actually looks
- [11:33] pretty good in my opinion. You have
- [11:34] better icons in terms of SVG. It did a
- [11:37] great job in generating these different
- [11:39] icons. You have the file explorer, which
- [11:41] actually works, and this is actually
- [11:43] great. And you can actually open up
- [11:44] these different individual applications.
- [11:47] There is documents, downloads. All these
- [11:49] components have been fully thoroughly
- [11:51] generated. You have the media player
- [11:53] which looks awesome. I don't believe
- [11:55] this is going to work, but it looks a
- [11:57] lot better than what I saw previously
- [11:59] with other models. You have a paint. All
- [12:02] these are functional apps that have been
- [12:03] generated, which is just awesome.
- [12:05] Notepad works. The calculator also
- [12:07] works. You also have a weather app,
- [12:09] which is great to see. You even have a
- [12:12] terminal and this terminal will actually
- [12:15] function as well. You have a calendar.
- [12:18] You have a browser which is really great
- [12:21] to see and it actually prompts you to
- [12:24] open it up within another uh prompt
- [12:27] within your web browser. There's a
- [12:29] settings tab where you can change the
- [12:31] personalization. You can change the
- [12:33] wallpaper which is pretty cool in my
- [12:35] opinion. So you can see how meticulous
- [12:38] it was in terms of generating all of
- [12:40] these components, which is just great to
- [12:41] see. There's a snake game that also
- [12:44] generated directly within the game. And
- [12:46] I believe you can actually interact with
- [12:47] it, which is just wild to me. You also
- [12:50] have mind sweeper, which it also
- [12:52] generated. And there's different levels
- [12:54] to this. So in my opinion, this is just
- [12:57] impressive cuz each detail has been
- [12:59] meticulously generated. You can see
- [13:01] there's a tab section. There's also the
- [13:04] actual Windows brow or not Windows but
- [13:06] you have that uh window that pops up
- [13:08] whenever you click the main settings tab
- [13:10] and you can log off, you can restart it,
- [13:12] you can lock your device. So each
- [13:14] component has been thoroughly generated
- [13:16] and in my opinion this model is actually
- [13:19] the best coding model that I've seen for
- [13:21] backend related tasks. So, in my
- [13:23] opinion, the new tech stack that I would
- [13:25] work with is having Claude Opus 4.5
- [13:28] powering my backend related tasks and
- [13:30] using front-end capabilities of Gemini
- [13:32] 3.0. And with the combination of the
- [13:35] two, you're going to be able to generate
- [13:37] a lot of great things with these two
- [13:38] models. Next up, I really want to test
- [13:41] the stress test of this model by using a
- [13:44] prompt like working on multiple subtests
- [13:47] where it's going to test the model's end
- [13:49] to end agentic dev skills. This is where
- [13:52] we're testing how agentic it is and how
- [13:54] it can orchestrate multiple tools. We
- [13:56] know this model is really good with tool
- [13:58] calling. So I want to see how well it is
- [14:00] in terms of performing this task where
- [14:02] it can clone a public GitHub repository
- [14:05] for a simple web app. Run and build test
- [14:08] commands in the shell. If the tests are
- [14:10] failing or lint errors, fix them
- [14:12] automatically. Commit your fixes and
- [14:15] push them back. Then set up the basic CI
- [14:17] config files and then generate the brief
- [14:20] summary. So essentially, we're having it
- [14:22] run down on understanding the code,
- [14:25] fixing failures, producing different
- [14:27] changes with minimal human prompting,
- [14:29] which is where I wanted to see how well
- [14:31] it is in terms of performing all these
- [14:34] specific actions from automated
- [14:36] debugging to CI/CD configuration to also
- [14:39] different tool orchestrations and web
- [14:41] search use cases. We're going to see how
- [14:43] robust it is with a prompt like this. So
- [14:46] it looks like it has finished
- [14:48] accomplishing this task and you can see
- [14:50] that it was able to clone the repository
- [14:52] which it did. It was able to run the
- [14:55] build test and it was able to see what
- [14:59] sort of errors it found. It fixed them
- [15:01] automatically like the issues amongst
- [15:03] all of these different files and it was
- [15:05] able to resolve all of them. And at the
- [15:08] end you can see the pull request list
- [15:09] that it had generated which is great to
- [15:12] see. And at the end there's also the
- [15:15] different branch that it created with
- [15:17] all the edits and the final test results
- [15:20] it was able to uh list. Now within open
- [15:22] router I had prompted to create a
- [15:24] Minecraft clone and this is what I have
- [15:27] gotten. I have gotten the control list.
- [15:29] I can click enter and this is the
- [15:31] Minecraft clone which actually looks
- [15:33] pretty good in my opinion. Now, in terms
- [15:35] of the functions though, it's not
- [15:37] working as I want it to be, which is
- [15:40] kind of unfortunate, but I guess you can
- [15:41] place down blocks, which is kind of
- [15:43] great to see. It added a great
- [15:46] atmosphere and terrain. And what you can
- [15:48] see is if you're turning around, there's
- [15:50] an interactive GUI at the top left that
- [15:53] showcases the FPS that's actually
- [15:55] showcasing the live view of it, the
- [15:58] facing direction, as well as a couple
- [16:00] other things like the chunk and the
- [16:02] ground. Now, I'm not too sure why my
- [16:04] current uh build is not working where I
- [16:07] can move. Maybe it's because I need to
- [16:09] install the files locally to have it
- [16:11] operational, but this is where I did a
- [16:13] great job in generating these different
- [16:15] components quite rapidly. If you like
- [16:18] this video and would love to support the
- [16:20] channel, you can consider donating to my
- [16:22] channel through the super thanks option

- [16:28] multiple subscriptions to different AI
- [16:30] tools for free on a monthly basis, plus
- [16:33] daily AI news and exclusive content,
- [16:36] plus a lot more. Overall, I believe
- [16:38] Enthropic is making a good standpoint in
- [16:41] the AI field right now with the release
- [16:43] of Claude Opus 4.5. This is a really
- [16:46] great model in my opinion and this is
- [16:49] personally the best coding model
- [16:50] available. Uh for front-end related
- [16:53] tasks, you can use Gemini 3.0 you know,
- [16:54] but with its aentic capabilities, this
- [16:56] is a perfect model that I would 100% use
- [16:59] as my day-to-day model. I'll leave all
- [17:02] these links in the description below.
- [17:03] Huge props to Enthropic team for killing
- [17:05] it with this model release. But with
- [17:07] that thought, guys, thank you guys so
