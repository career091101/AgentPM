- [00:00] All right, so another pretty wild week
- [00:02] in AI. Open AAI just held their annual
- [00:05] dev day where they revealed what's
- [00:07] coming next. Basically, their future
- [00:09] vision for ChatBT. Figure dropped a
- [00:12] massive update to their robots, showing
- [00:14] new capabilities that CEO Brett Adcock
- [00:17] says could change everything. And
- [00:20] Nvidia's Jensen Huang had some pretty
- [00:22] shocking things to say about China and
- [00:25] their growing advantages in the AI race.
- [00:28] Let's get into it. All right, so
- [00:29] starting with OpenAI's Dev Day, one of
- [00:32] the first things they showed off was
- [00:33] their insane user growth. They now have
- [00:36] 800 million weekly active users, up 8x
- [00:40] from just last year, and they're now
- [00:43] also generating billions of tokens per
- [00:45] minute. So yeah, demand is clearly still
- [00:48] skyrocketing. Then they dropped the big
- [00:50] stuff, apps inside Chachib and a brand
- [00:53] new agent builder. Apps inside Chachib
- [00:56] is pretty wild. It basically lets you
- [00:59] use many apps built right inside chatbt.
- [01:02] So instead of jumping between tabs,
- [01:04] chatbt can now pull in tools,
- [01:06] extensions, and even custom assistants
- [01:09] that work directly in the chat. Think of
- [01:11] it like chatbt slowly turning into your
- [01:13] operating system. One that already knows
- [01:16] your context, remembers what you've
- [01:18] talked about, and can actually use those
- [01:20] apps to get things done for you. Here's
- [01:22] a quick demo. When someone's using
- [01:24] chatbt, you'll be able to find an app by
- [01:26] asking for it by name. For example, you
- [01:30] could sketch out a product flow for
- [01:32] chatbt and then say, "Figma, turn the
- [01:34] sketch into a workable diagram." The
- [01:36] Figma app will take over respond and
- [01:38] complete the action. You can also then
- [01:40] launch Fig Jam from Chatbt if you want
- [01:42] to iterate further. We're also making
- [01:44] apps discoverable right in the
- [01:46] conversation. So, when a user asks for
- [01:49] something, we can surface a relevant app
- [01:50] as a recommendation. Maybe a user says
- [01:53] they need a playlist for their party
- [01:54] this weekend. Chachi BT could then
- [01:56] recommend building it in Spotify. It's
- [01:58] an easy way to find the right app or
- [02:00] have the right app presented to you at
- [02:01] the right time. And there will be a
- [02:02] whole bunch of new ways for developers
- [02:04] to get discovered.
- [02:05] >> So yeah, that's the idea. Users can now
- [02:07] interact with apps naturally inside of
- [02:10] chatbt and it can use them contextually
- [02:13] to actually do things for you. But the
- [02:15] wild part is you can actually build your
- [02:18] own even if you're not a developer.
- [02:20] OpenAI announced something called the
- [02:22] agent kit and at the core of it is the
- [02:24] new agent builder. Basically, it's a
- [02:27] visual canvas that lets anyone design
- [02:29] and deploy their own AI agents. No
- [02:31] coding needed. You can map out the
- [02:33] logic, test it right there, and ship it
- [02:36] straight into Chatbt. There's also a
- [02:38] chat kit for embedding chat interfaces
- [02:41] into your own apps, plus built-in eval
- [02:44] tools so developers can track how their
- [02:46] agents make decisions and improve over
- [02:48] time. In short, OpenAI just made it
- [02:51] easier than ever to build and ship AI
- [02:54] agents. And while it's only available in
- [02:57] preview right now, I have a feeling this
- [02:59] is going to be huge. I mean, just think
- [03:01] about where this is heading. Soon,
- [03:03] anyone from indie creators to massive
- [03:06] research teams will be able to spin up
- [03:09] their own specialized AI agent for
- [03:11] anything. Scientists could build agents
- [03:14] that automate experiments or analyze new
- [03:16] data. startups, even big companies could
- [03:19] roll out entire customer support systems
- [03:21] in a day, and individuals could
- [03:24] literally have their own AI coworker
- [03:26] customized just for them. It's really
- [03:28] one of those updates that quietly shifts
- [03:31] what's possible. And it kind of ties
- [03:33] into what Sam Ultimate said during dev
- [03:35] day about AGI feeling closer because
- [03:38] we're already seeing glimpses of it.
- [03:40] Models like GBT 5 Pro starting to make
- [03:42] actual discoveries on their own. And now
- [03:45] with agents in the mix, that progress is
- [03:48] only going to accelerate. Check it out.
- [03:50] >> Like many other people, I have multiple
- [03:52] definitions of AGI. It's it's a the
- [03:54] closer we get to it, the fuzzier concept
- [03:57] the concept becomes. But the one thing
- [03:59] that I care the most about, and to my
- [04:01] like great surprise, we're finally in
- [04:02] the moment where it's starting to
- [04:03] happen, is when AI can do novel
- [04:05] discovery. when AI can like expand the
- [04:09] total human knowledge base and
- [04:13] it's these things are very small I
- [04:15] really don't want to overstate it but
- [04:16] you see all these examples now on
- [04:18] Twitter where scientists in these
- [04:19] different fields are saying like it made
- [04:21] a small discovery or it came up with a
- [04:23] novel approach or it figured something
- [04:24] out and
- [04:27] again don't want to overstate it don't
- [04:28] want to understate it either like this
- [04:30] is this is like the thing and the fact
- [04:32] that we're at the very beginning of that
- [04:34] and that we are optimistic we'll be ble
- [04:36] to push hard on it in the coming months
- [04:39] and years. Like that that is a really
- [04:42] big deal. That's probably the like
- [04:46] AGI like thing I care about the most.
- [04:48] >> So yeah, this is something Sam Ultman's
- [04:50] been very vocal about, the idea of AI
- [04:53] accelerating scientific discovery and
- [04:56] actually coming up with its own
- [04:57] insights. And it seems like we're
- [04:59] finally starting to see that now, which
- [05:01] is both extremely exciting and also kind
- [05:04] of terrifying because, well, in literal
- [05:07] real time, we're watching these AIs
- [05:10] start to surpass our collective human
- [05:12] intelligence. It's honestly wild. And
- [05:15] Google's latest update is a perfect
- [05:17] example of that. They just dropped
- [05:19] Gemini 2.5 for computer use, and it's
- [05:22] already hitting new state-of-the-art
- [05:24] scores across multiple benchmarks. This
- [05:27] thing doesn't just process information.
- [05:29] It actually uses your computer to solve
- [05:31] tasks. Like a digital coworker that can
- [05:34] click, search, and execute commands
- [05:36] completely on its own. These computer
- [05:38] use agents have only been around for
- [05:40] what, maybe 2 or 3 years. And they're
- [05:43] already better at using a computer than
- [05:45] a lot of people I know. Granted, a lot
- [05:47] of old people I know. But still, the
- [05:50] progress here is incredible. It reminds
- [05:52] me of the progress we've seen with AI
- [05:54] image and video models, which somehow
- [05:57] keep pushing the boundaries of what's
- [05:58] possible. This week, XAI dropped Grom
- [06:01] Imagine version.9, their new video
- [06:04] generation model with major upgrades in
- [06:06] visual quality, motion, audio
- [06:09] generation, and more. Now, it's no Sora
- [06:12] 2, but it's still an impressive model
- [06:14] all around. And what really sets it
- [06:16] apart is that it's incredibly
- [06:18] unfiltered. I can't even show you some
- [06:20] of the stuff this model can generate on
- [06:22] YouTube, but if you're on X, you've
- [06:24] probably already seen it. It's easily
- [06:26] the most unfiltered model I've seen, and
- [06:29] I'm not even kidding. And now, while AI
- [06:32] models keep getting smarter, the real
- [06:34] world side of things is catching up
- [06:36] fast, too. Figure just unveiled their
- [06:39] brand new humanoid robot, Figure03, and
- [06:42] it's a massive leap forward. It's been
- [06:45] completely redesigned from the ground
- [06:46] up. faster sensors, smoother movement,
- [06:50] lower latency, and way more precise hand
- [06:52] control. Its new tactile fingertips can
- [06:55] detect forces as tiny as 3 g, meaning it
- [06:59] can pick up delicate objects like an egg
- [07:01] or handle tools with actual finesse. But
- [07:04] it's not just about performance. This
- [07:06] version was built for scale. They've
- [07:08] reworked the hardware, materials, and
- [07:11] supply chain so these robots can
- [07:13] actually be mass- prodduced. And the
- [07:15] wild part is Figure says this model is
- [07:18] designed not just for factories but for
- [07:20] homes. It's smaller, quieter, wirelessly
- [07:23] charges through its feet, and uses
- [07:26] softer materials, so it's safe to be
- [07:28] around. Here's a short clip they posted
- [07:30] that honestly feels like a glimpse into
- [07:32] the future. Check this out.
- [07:36] >> Hello.
- [07:38] >> Hello, Andrea. Here is your key. You'll
- [07:40] be in room 23. The elevators are past
- [07:43] the door on the right. Enjoy your stay.
- [07:50] >> So yeah, this is honestly insane, guys.
- [07:53] I can't stress enough how transformative
- [07:55] AI powered robotics will be. I mean,
- [07:58] we're literally creating AI models that
- [08:00] are smarter than us and then embodying
- [08:03] them in robotic bodies that will
- [08:05] eventually be better than ours, more
- [08:07] dextrous, faster, stronger, more
- [08:10] durable. All the above. The inevitable
- [08:13] outcome of this feels almost obvious.
- [08:16] Once these systems can think, move, and
- [08:19] produce better than we can in the real
- [08:21] world, everything about how the world
- [08:23] operates starts to shift from jobs to
- [08:27] the economy to society in general. Now,
- [08:30] on a completely different note, and to
- [08:32] wrap up this week's AI recap, Nvidia's
- [08:35] Jensen Hang made some pretty strong
- [08:38] comments this week about China and the
- [08:40] global AI race. In a CNBC interview, he
- [08:43] basically said that while the US is
- [08:45] leading in model innovation, China is
- [08:47] rapidly advancing on almost all other
- [08:50] fronts. I don't think I can actually
- [08:52] play this clip due to copyright reasons,
- [08:54] but here is a great summary. Nvidia CEO.
- [08:57] China way ahead on energy. US way ahead
- [09:00] on chips. China competitive on
- [09:03] infrastructure. China competitive on AI
- [09:05] models. China way ahead in open-source
- [09:08] models. US frontier models better
- [09:10] overall though. China has lighter
- [09:13] industrial regulation. China
- [09:15] applications advancing fast. China's
- [09:17] society adopts new technology faster.
- [09:20] China has the larger government supplied
- [09:23] non-in training data. US companies and
- [09:26] society need to adopt AI faster. So
- [09:29] yeah, he paints a pretty clear picture.
- [09:31] China isn't just catching up, they're
- [09:33] competing on almost every level. Hearing
- [09:35] that from Jensen Huang, the guy whose
- [09:38] chips literally power the entire AI
- [09:40] industry should make everyone pay
- [09:42] attention because again, this isn't just
- [09:44] a software race anymore. It's an
- [09:46] infrastructure race, an energy race, and
- [09:49] maybe even a cultural one. Either way,
- [09:52] it's clear the next phase of AI isn't
- [09:54] just about who can build the smarter
- [09:56] models, but who can build the world
- [09:58] those models run in. Basically, who can
- [10:01] build the next internet, but this time
- [10:03] powered by intelligence, not
- [10:05] information. Anyways, that's all for
- [10:08] this week's AI recap. Drop a like,
- [10:11] subscribe to stay ahead of the curve,
- [10:12] and as always, I'll be catching you guys
- [10:15] in the next
