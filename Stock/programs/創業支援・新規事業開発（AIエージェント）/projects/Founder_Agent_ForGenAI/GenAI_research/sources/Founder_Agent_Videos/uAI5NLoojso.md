## Text

- [00:00] Vibe coding tools like lovable, cursor,
- [00:02] and bolt allowed people to create apps
- [00:04] without writing a single line of code.
- [00:06] But these are all mostly one feature
- [00:08] apps. Anytime you want to vibe code
- [00:10] advanced workflows or AI agents,
- [00:13] everything just breaks. But people are
- [00:15] starting to realize that you can just
- [00:16] build agents on these noode workflow
- [00:19] tools like N8N and plug them into your
- [00:22] vibecoded apps. These are what I call
- [00:24] vibecoded agentic apps or VAPS. And
- [00:27] that's exactly what we're going to be
- [00:28] building today. We are going to create
- [00:30] an AI agent workflow on N8. No code
- [00:33] necessary. Then we will vibe code an app
- [00:36] from our phone. Then we're going to
- [00:38] connect the NAN AI agent to our
- [00:40] vibecoded app. And finally, we'll show
- [00:42] you the four AI agent templates that you
- [00:45] can download. Let's dive in. Okay. To do
- [00:48] this, I brought Muhammad. So, this is a
- [00:50] full N workflow with an agent. But
- [00:53] today, I want to show you how to build
- [00:54] one from scratch. Let's go ahead and go
- [00:56] home. And to create a new workflow,
- [00:58] you're just going to hit this button on
- [00:59] the top right, create workflow. And here
- [01:02] you're brought to your canvas. So every
- [01:04] single N workflow starts out with just
- [01:06] like nothing on it. Just nothing on it.
- [01:07] We first have to add a trigger. And
- [01:09] there's a lot of different triggers we
- [01:11] can choose from, like app events, but
- [01:13] today we're just going to do a web hook.
- [01:15] With the web hook, we can hit it
- [01:16] whenever we want, wherever we want. So
- [01:19] we can trigger it ourselves. Yeah. So
- [01:20] we've created this web hook, but it's
- [01:22] not connected to anything. It's not
- [01:23] connected to anything. So, let's go
- [01:24] ahead and connect it to the new Nan tool
- [01:28] of AI agents. And this this tool right
- [01:31] here, I do want to add before this, you
- [01:33] would have to be very technical to
- [01:35] create an AI agent, right? Like it's
- [01:37] very hard to create, but this visual
- [01:38] interface just makes it a lot easier to
- [01:40] understand. Yes. And it's also really
- [01:41] fun to make as well. So, what are those
- [01:43] three little things sticking out of
- [01:44] them? So, the three little things we
- [01:46] have chat model, memory, and tool. So,
- [01:49] let's start with chat model. It has a
- [01:50] lot of different providers you can
- [01:52] choose from, but today we're just going
- [01:53] to stick with Enthropic because the
- [01:55] Claude model is the best agent model out
- [01:58] there right now. So before we can get
- [01:59] started with anything, we're going to
- [02:00] have to add our own credentials. Here we
- [02:02] have our own. But in case you don't,
- [02:04] just go ahead and create a new
- [02:05] credential. So whenever you want to use
- [02:08] any API, which is what these are called,
- [02:10] right? If you want to use OpenAI, if you
- [02:12] want to use Anthropic, Grock, doesn't
- [02:14] matter. You basically need a key that
- [02:16] connects whatever tool you're using this
- [02:18] into to your account, right? N8N makes
- [02:21] it easy to kind of centralize these keys
- [02:23] without having to know how to code. You
- [02:25] plug it in. Now you have access to clot.
- [02:26] Yeah, exactly. And if you still need
- [02:28] help with that, NAN has a lot of docs
- [02:30] for these. It'll tell you how to find
- [02:32] the key and put it into N. And after
- [02:34] that, you're all set. It'll work for
- [02:35] just not just this workflow, but every
- [02:37] other workflow you create. Amazing. So
- [02:39] after you have your credential set up,
- [02:41] they also have memory, but we'll go over
- [02:43] that in a future video. And we're going
- [02:44] to go over to tools. And N has a lot
- [02:48] over 400 different tools you can give to
- [02:50] the agent. But as we promised, this does
- [02:52] take some time to get used to. To make
- [02:54] it easier on you, we actually created a
- [02:58] template database, and it's actually
- [02:59] really easy to use. Yeah. So once you
- [03:01] head over to the description, there's a
- [03:02] link with these three templates that you
- [03:04] can get started. um you just go ahead
- [03:06] and open them, scroll down and copy this
- [03:08] JSON. Let's go ahead and get rid of this
- [03:11] command V and the entire workflow is
- [03:14] there for you. So the same thing like we
- [03:16] have the same chat model but now we have
- [03:18] all these other tools. Yeah, we have
- [03:20] these five different tools that the AI
- [03:22] agent will use when it wants to when it
- [03:24] wants to and reasons to. Yes. So the
- [03:26] first tool it has gets the date allows
- [03:28] the AI agent to get the date and time
- [03:30] and then the second one Google calendar
- [03:32] allows the agent to create a calendar
- [03:34] event. We also have a notion tool which
- [03:36] allows the AI agent to add things to our
- [03:38] to-do list. And then we also have two
- [03:41] Slack tools which allow the agent to get
- [03:43] all the users in Slack and then send a
- [03:45] message to a specific user. And what's
- [03:47] cool about agents and what makes it
- [03:50] different than what many of you guys
- [03:52] have seen likely with Zapier make these
- [03:54] aren't just like linear paths, right?
- [03:56] You have an agent and you have a really
- [03:58] smart AI agent, right? These cla models
- [04:02] are built to be agents out of the box.
- [04:04] They're built to use tools and so we're
- [04:06] basically giving it access to these
- [04:07] tools that it can use based on whatever
- [04:10] our our input is. So how do we actually
- [04:12] send something into this AI agent? Yeah.
- [04:15] So going back to the web hook, nan gives
- [04:17] you a URL and you can paste that into
- [04:20] any vivecoded app. I've already went
- [04:22] ahead and built one. We're actually
- [04:24] going to be building an app just like
- [04:25] this in just a second, but just to show
- [04:27] you how it works, you want to just I
- [04:29] have the web hook set up to the app and
- [04:32] I'm going to say create a calendar event
- [04:36] at 700 p.m. today to clean my car. Also
- [04:41] send a message to Riley saying, "Good
- [04:45] job on the podcast." And go ahead and
- [04:48] test the workflow. Go back to the phone
- [04:50] and let's send it to Nan. Amazing. And
- [04:53] now the AI agent is reasoning and
- [04:55] planning its steps on how to complete
- [04:57] the task. Amazing. So, you sent it in
- [04:59] from your phone app that you vibe coded
- [05:01] and now it's thinking about what tools
- [05:03] it needs to use. It just decided that it
- [05:05] needed to find people in your Slack. It
- [05:07] sent a message on Slack and now it's
- [05:09] adding an event on the calendar. Yeah.
- [05:10] So, let's let it finish up. Okay.
- [05:13] Success. So, let's see the results.
- [05:15] Let's go to the calendar. Clean my car.
- [05:17] 7 to 8:00 p.m. Amazing. Now, let's go
- [05:19] check Slack. Let's go check Riley. good
- [05:22] job on the podcast. Amazing. So, you
- [05:25] literally were able to build an app on
- [05:27] your phone and without writing any code
- [05:29] that we're going to talk about in just a
- [05:30] second. Then you created this AI agent
- [05:33] without writing any code on n and then
- [05:35] you use this web hook so that your phone
- [05:37] could communicate with this agent and in
- [05:40] one command you got it to basically
- [05:42] check your calendar, send a message on
- [05:44] the calendar and then also message me on
- [05:46] Slack in one single That's exactly
- [05:48] right. What I want to do is I want to
- [05:50] dive into actually building the
- [05:51] vibecoded app that can connect to any
- [05:54] N8N agent. So I'm starting off exactly
- [05:56] where you just were after you pasted the
- [05:59] template into N8N. And here it is. So we
- [06:02] have this AI agent right here. And here
- [06:04] we have the Vibe Code app. So we're
- [06:06] going to be vibe coding an app on our
- [06:07] phone, right? Let's go ahead and just
- [06:09] design the front end of the app first
- [06:11] before we do any web hooks. So, what I
- [06:14] want to do here is I'm going to say,
- [06:16] "Please create an app, a chat interface,
- [06:19] and I want to be able to chat with uh
- [06:22] AI." So, use an AI model. I want to be
- [06:25] able to chat with AI. Make it look
- [06:27] retro. Have the background be like dark
- [06:30] blue, have the header text be like neon
- [06:33] green, and then make the body text
- [06:35] white. Instead of ever putting anything
- [06:37] in like a component circle or like a
- [06:40] rounded rectangle, underline things.
- [06:42] Okay, that was a long prompt. We can now
- [06:44] press generate. You try it out on
- [06:47] cursor, wind surf, try it out on lovable
- [06:49] if you want to create a web app. I
- [06:51] actually wanted to make a a mobile app,
- [06:53] like a native mobile app. So, I'm using
- [06:54] the vibe code app. So, so it is now
- [06:57] bundling and so our initial Ooh, that's
- [07:00] kind of sick actually. Look at that. So,
- [07:02] this is the app that we've created right
- [07:04] here. And yeah, retro terminal AI. And
- [07:10] so,
- [07:11] um, we can enter a command. I love this.
- [07:15] Hello there. Send processing. Ooh, and
- [07:19] the AI works like out of the box. Okay,
- [07:22] this is actually so sick. Really good
- [07:24] for one prompt. So, what I actually want
- [07:25] to first do like right away um is I
- [07:28] actually want to go home because I want
- [07:32] to save the AI chat for later. So, what
- [07:34] I'm going to do is I'm actually just
- [07:35] going to duplicate this project. So,
- [07:37] this version I'm going to turn into the
- [07:39] the web hook one and I'm going to keep
- [07:40] the AI chat. Now, I want to completely
- [07:44] change the way that this kind of the
- [07:46] chat works. It should the the the
- [07:48] display of it should be the same, but
- [07:50] instead we're going to hook this up to
- [07:52] an N8N workflow. And I want to be able
- [07:55] to send in, how would you word this?
- [07:59] Send in web hooks. Send in data to a web
- [08:01] hook or how would you word it? I would
- [08:03] just say send text to a web hook. I want
- [08:04] to be able to send text to a web hook.
- [08:07] Um, and I'm going to give you the web
- [08:09] hook URL in just a second. Um, I want to
- [08:12] be able to send in uh data into that web
- [08:14] hook. I want it to await the response
- [08:16] from the N8N agent and uh display it on
- [08:20] the screen. Perfect. Great. And now,
- [08:22] while it's transcribing, we're going to
- [08:24] go over to web hook. We're going to
- [08:25] click on this and we are going to grab
- [08:28] the test URL, which is right here. We're
- [08:31] going to copy it and we're going to
- [08:33] paste that into our app. So, we're going
- [08:37] to say here is the uh URL for web hook.
- [08:42] And now we can paste it in. Now, we are
- [08:46] good to go. Oh, perfect. Amazing. So,
- [08:50] now our app directly from our phone. And
- [08:52] remember, you just copied and pasted
- [08:54] this agent in. And you can customize
- [08:56] this agent. You're going to have to set
- [08:57] it up to your own account, but that'll
- [08:58] take you max like 10 15 minutes. And
- [09:00] then you can build an app on your phone
- [09:02] like this. This is our second prompt in
- [09:04] like four or five minutes. And so like
- [09:06] we're looking at a total of 30 minutes
- [09:09] so far. And if this works, knock on
- [09:11] wood. Um we're gonna have a fully
- [09:14] vibecoded agentic application or VAP on
- [09:17] our phone. And keep in mind we have
- [09:18] written zero lines of code so far. Okay,
- [09:21] so it's done. It says you may need to
- [09:22] reload to see the update. I always just
- [09:24] reload it at the end. So now it still
- [09:26] has all the old data in here from
- [09:28] before. Um oh, can we clear? What does
- [09:31] that do? Oh wait, what the heck? System
- [09:35] initialize N workflow online ready for
- [09:38] input. What the hell? That's awesome.
- [09:41] Okay, so now we're going to send in some
- [09:43] information. So before we do this,
- [09:46] remember I passed in my test URL,
- [09:48] meaning this is really cool because it
- [09:51] allows you to like really see where
- [09:54] things go wrong when you're testing,
- [09:55] right? Um, but the thing that you need
- [09:57] to do is you literally need to hit test
- [09:59] every single time there is a like every
- [10:02] time you use it, right? which is kind of
- [10:04] annoying, but it allows you to kind of
- [10:06] see this visual, which I think is the
- [10:07] coolest part of any an right. There's
- [10:09] also a production URL that you can hit
- [10:11] wherever. So, you don't need to test the
- [10:13] workflow for it to work. You can just be
- [10:15] anywhere, send it through, and it'll
- [10:17] work. If you press this button up here,
- [10:19] that makes it active. If your workflow
- [10:21] is active with the web hook, you can hit
- [10:23] it at any time, as many times as you
- [10:24] want. And if you come back, you hit
- [10:26] executions, you can see all of the
- [10:28] executions that happen on that web hook.
- [10:30] Yes. Which is really cool. Okay.
- [10:32] Amazing. So now what we're going to do
- [10:34] is we're going to test and see if this
- [10:36] works. Please add eating pizza to my
- [10:41] todo list. Send. Can I come with you?
- [10:45] Damn it. Okay. So, as you can see here,
- [10:48] it successfully triggered the web the
- [10:50] web hook, but it actually didn't the
- [10:53] data probably wasn't formatted correctly
- [10:56] for the agent to like ingest it. So, you
- [10:58] can actually look into this. This is no
- [11:00] prompt specified. Um, no JSON body text.
- [11:03] So, I think that just means it got it in
- [11:05] the wrong format. What's a good fix for
- [11:07] this? What would you say? It's super
- [11:08] easy. N shows you the exact JSON key
- [11:11] that was sent. So, if you go ahead and
- [11:13] click on the AI agent node, AI agent
- [11:15] node. Yeah. And then on that left
- [11:17] sidebar, it shows you the web hook that
- [11:18] it received. So, you can scroll down to
- [11:20] the bottom and you should see your
- [11:22] message, which is body and then message.
- [11:25] And right now, it is set to body.ext. So
- [11:28] click on the prompt, the user message.
- [11:30] The prompt user message. Okay. And we're
- [11:32] going to go ahead and change that. And
- [11:34] instead of body.ext, we're going to do
- [11:35] body message. Okay. So we're going to
- [11:38] remove this. And then you can go schema,
- [11:41] right? Yes. You can also just drag it in
- [11:42] as well. That's super easy. I like doing
- [11:44] that. It's easier for me for my non I
- [11:46] don't like to ever type things when I
- [11:48] don't have to. It's going to be wherever
- [11:50] whatever we said, right? Please add
- [11:52] eating pizza to my to-do list, right?
- [11:55] And so we have this prompt user message,
- [11:57] right? And it needs to get the thing
- [11:59] that you said. And so look for the thing
- [12:00] that you said when it fails. And just
- [12:02] drag it in. Perfect. There we go. It
- [12:05] lights up green. Let's go ahead and test
- [12:07] this. Agent is thinking right now.
- [12:10] Amazing. I love how workflow executing.
- [12:12] That looks so good on the phone right
- [12:14] there. That looks really good. Okay.
- [12:16] Added something to the calendar. And
- [12:19] boom. It sent a message on Slack. And
- [12:21] let's go ahead and check uh the Slack.
- [12:23] I'll just check the Slack. Muhammad. Uh,
- [12:26] hey Muhammad. Just wanted to give you a
- [12:27] heads up. There's a pizza eating session
- [12:29] scheduled today at 7:17, which it came
- [12:32] in one minute ago, 7:17 p.m. Pacific
- [12:35] time in about 3 hours. Hope you can join
- [12:36] us for delicious pizza. So, yeah. And
- [12:38] so, it also added it to the calendar.
- [12:40] And you get the point, right? I
- [12:42] recommend just like looking up tutorials
- [12:44] and try to figure out like if you use a
- [12:46] sauna, if you use a convert kit, right?
- [12:49] That's another thing that we use. like
- [12:51] you can automate a ton of things and try
- [12:54] and use AI to figure out how you can
- [12:56] create useful agentic workflows because
- [12:58] not only can you create tools, right?
- [13:00] Not only can you create these like
- [13:01] standalone tools, we can take this
- [13:03] entire we could take the whole workflow
- [13:06] without the web hook and make it a tool
- [13:09] that an AI agent could call. Right.
- [13:11] Right. Yes. That's insane actually.
- [13:13] Yeah. Like we need to that should be our
- [13:15] next video. Yeah. And if you guys have
- [13:16] any suggestions about any type of
- [13:18] workflows you guys want to see, just let
- [13:20] us know. I think we can start doing
- [13:21] them. Yeah, 100%. And we're also
- [13:24] creating a community. So if you go to
- [13:26] vaps.ai,
- [13:28] v a ps.ai,
- [13:31] you can find our community. And that's
- [13:33] where we're going to put all of our
- [13:34] templates. I'll see you in the next one.
