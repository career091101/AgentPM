- [00:04] Physical AI is about bringing
artificial intelligence
- [00:07] into the real world.
- [00:09] Cities are crammed full of
great rich sensor data, video
- [00:13] data that could be used to
help drive smarter decisions.
- [00:16] Milestone has got this really
rich history of large-scale
- [00:21] video technology deployment and we
want to try and use that heritage
- [00:25] to help cities drive smarter
decisions by training AI models.
- [00:29] For us, we think we can help
them do that anywhere from
- [00:31] data collection all the way
through to deployment.
- [00:34] K2K is an Italy-based company.
- [00:36] We have been working for more
than 30 years in the production
- [00:39] of neural networks architectures
to extract the meaning in
- [00:43] real time from video streams.
- [00:44] We have been working with
several cities in order to
- [00:48] enhance and enable cities
to manage their infrastructure
- [00:52] and also capitalize on the data
and knowledge that there is already
- [00:56] extracted and capitalized on.
- [00:58] What we're doing with Aquila
is we're working with operator
- [01:02] of large-scale portfolio of
buildings and infrastructure,
- [01:06] and we are helping them to
transform and make their buildings
- [01:09] and their portfolio more efficient.
- [01:11] So we are developing specifically
AI agents to accelerate
- [01:16] the decarbonization of the
portfolio of our clients.
- [01:19] So the AI agents will detect
across a large volume of buildings
- [01:24] and infrastructure.
- [01:27] We have been working seamlessly
with NVIDIA and with their
- [01:31] software SAC, specifically
Metropolis and NIMS, AI Blueprints
- [01:35] and Define Tuning Microservices,
to develop several use cases
- [01:38] and deploy them in smart cities.
- [01:40] Lately, we have been developing
the VLM, integrating NVIDIA VSS
- [01:45] for video search and summarization,
and we have been developing
- [01:48] a global VQA, which stands for
Global Video Question Answering.
- [01:52] And it's a technology that allows
municipalities to have instant
- [01:56] insights in natural language on
whatever is happening in the city.
- [02:00] And also it produces automatic
reports that are sent to the
- [02:05] city officials on hourly basis.
- [02:07] So being able to capitalize on
that knowledge is one of the
- [02:12] most important benefits for them.
- [02:14] Within NVIDIA and the city
of Genoa, we're building this
- [02:18] incredibly rich data set.
- [02:20] Genoa's an interesting use
case because it's got a complex
- [02:23] city environment.
- [02:24] It's narrow streets, it's
motorcycles, but that
- [02:27] translates really well
into other city environments.
- [02:30] We then take that training data and
produce the vision language model,
- [02:35] which can then be used for smarter
decision-making by other cities.
- [02:39] Our aim is to take that one
step further, is to build
- [02:42] the world's largest AI video
data library which is anonymized,
- [02:47] compliant and traceable.
- [02:50] The most exciting thing,
in my opinion, is that we
- [02:53] are really redefining a
new evolution on technology.
- [02:58] We are bridging from physical
AI to the digital world.
- [03:02] Now we are developing and
deploying models right now
- [03:05] in cities, enabling a better
future, a more conscious and
- [03:10] awareness future for cities and
citizens, but not only in there.
- [03:14] And being able to put all of
this data together is one of the
- [03:18] most exciting things, obviously.
