- [00:00] [music]
- [00:03] How can we get cloud code works well as
- [00:05] your codebase became more and more
- [00:06] complicated without getting to circles
- [00:09] and make you feel frustrated? Once I
- [00:11] learned that there are many things you
- [00:12] can do to improve performance
- [00:13] dramatically through good context
- [00:15] engineering and context engineering
- [00:17] basically means how you can optimize
- [00:19] what goes into conversation history
- [00:20] thread for the cloud code or codeex so
- [00:23] that only relevant and necessary
- [00:24] information are included here to guide
- [00:26] agents next actions. As we know coding
- [00:28] agent like cloud code at default has
- [00:30] 200,000 token context limit and if you
- [00:33] run / contacts in your cloud code you
- [00:35] will see breakdown token consumptions
- [00:37] across different categories and this is
- [00:38] a very basic example of what you can do
- [00:40] with context engineering optimization
- [00:42] because in general the whole context
- [00:43] consist of few different things the
- [00:45] system promise assistant tools is
- [00:47] something you can't really change it
- [00:48] always comes with agent so the part you
- [00:50] can optimize is the agent has any MCP
- [00:53] tools or custom agents that you don't
- [00:54] really use but consume a lot of tokens
- [00:56] and the memory file here are basically
- [00:58] your cloud.md file and I know as your
- [01:00] project became bigger and bigger
- [01:01] sometimes the cloud MD file just became
- [01:03] so big that leaves very little room for
- [01:05] the actual message. So in this very
- [01:07] specific example I can already see that
- [01:09] if I remove all those MCPS from this
- [01:11] agent it will immediately give me 2%
- [01:13] additional context token window. So this
- [01:15] is one very basic example of what you
- [01:17] can do to optimize context window
- [01:19] better. The key part you want to
- [01:20] optimize is the actual message which
- [01:22] including the user message you send as
- [01:24] well as list of two call actions that
- [01:26] the agent take and the key thing here is
- [01:28] that how can you making sure all the
- [01:29] information in the history here is
- [01:31] relevant and reduce noise as much as
- [01:33] possible and there are many things you
- [01:35] can do here for example sub agent is a
- [01:36] great tool that you can use to reduce
- [01:38] context so when I look at what happened
- [01:40] here if you prompt agent help me add a
- [01:42] Google O the majority of the actions
- [01:45] agent take here is actually not about
- [01:46] making trends but doing the research to
- [01:48] figure out the I plan for the
- [01:50] implementation and those research steps
- [01:52] generally took whole bunch of context in
- [01:54] the conversation thread and with feature
- [01:56] like sub agents instead of including all
- [01:58] those research related token consumption
- [02:00] in the main conversation thread you just
- [02:01] delegate and offload the whole token
- [02:03] consumption related to research to the
- [02:05] sub agent where it has isolated
- [02:07] conversation thread to do just this and
- [02:09] return back a summary of the research
- [02:11] which means only absolute necessary
- [02:13] information and tokens are included in
- [02:15] the main conversation thread. So one
- [02:17] very basic thing you can do is that
- [02:18] before you implement big feature you can
- [02:20] just add a small text that let's use
- [02:22] task or sub agent to do the research
- [02:24] first so that it can trigger this
- [02:25] specific behavior and this is why I
- [02:27] often use a compact command much more
- [02:29] proactively so that after agent complete
- [02:31] certain set of fairly isolated task
- [02:33] often just run the compact so that we
- [02:35] can proactively clean up the
- [02:37] conversation threadive
- [02:39] methods that I often use is set up your
- [02:42] own documentation system for your
- [02:44] codebase there are many different ways
- [02:45] you can do Yeah. And this is the part I
- [02:47] want to dive a bit deeper today. But
- [02:48] before we dive into that, one trend has
- [02:50] been happening is that more and more
- [02:51] people use cloud code to not only doing
- [02:53] coding task but day-to-day operation
- [02:55] task from handling your emails, using
- [02:57] different system, automate tasking,
- [02:58] different productivity apps, journaling
- [03:00] and this tell us there's massive layer
- [03:02] to build. Look at what type of use case
- [03:04] people are trying to hack into cloud
- [03:06] code then productionize it into aic
- [03:08] products. That's why I want to introduce
- [03:09] you to this research called AI agents
- [03:11] unleashed a pragmatic report about what
- [03:13] kind of things and use case people are
- [03:15] hacking agents into who those people are
- [03:17] what they doing and dive deeply into
- [03:19] real world examples where they interview
- [03:21] hundreds of people from top stars and
- [03:23] enterprise in the world across marketing
- [03:24] sales operation as well as real world
- [03:26] learnings of what actually worked and
- [03:27] what didn't the common pitfalls and
- [03:29] challenge that people are facing today.
- [03:30] So you can use those information to
- [03:32] direct your agenda product road map much
- [03:33] better. One of the favorite part is that
- [03:35] they propose a really useful framework
- [03:37] to think through if a task and use case
- [03:39] that can drive huge business value that
- [03:40] people are currently paying for. So if
- [03:42] you're trying to build a genus, I highly
- [03:44] recommend you go check out this
- [03:45] research. You can access this report for
- [03:47] free in description below. And thanks
- [03:49] HubSpot for sponsoring this video. Now
- [03:51] let's talk about my documentation system
- [03:53] for cloud code. So the purpose of
- [03:55] documentation system is to create a
- [03:56] summarized snapshot of your current
- [03:58] codebase. So instead of agent every time
- [04:00] doing deep research across the whole
- [04:02] codebase to find information that it
- [04:04] need, it can just read a summarized
- [04:06] documentation that clearly pull all the
- [04:08] relevant information together. So it has
- [04:10] less noise in the context window and
- [04:12] also making sure all the relevant
- [04:13] information are feeding into context
- [04:15] instead of hoping agent pull all the
- [04:17] relevant information together by itself.
- [04:18] And the question is what type of
- [04:19] documentation is useful and how can you
- [04:22] make it scalable as your codebase became
- [04:23] larger and larger. So the common
- [04:25] structure I have is something like this.
- [04:27] I typically just have this dot agent
- [04:28] folder that contain all the relevant and
- [04:30] useful information that I need. So one
- [04:32] is a task folder. This is where I store
- [04:34] all the PRDs and if you don't know what
- [04:35] PRD is basically before I implement any
- [04:38] feature I always turn on plan mode and
- [04:39] ask to generate implementation plan and
- [04:41] after finish I will always store the
- [04:43] implementation plan in the task folder.
- [04:45] So next time if we are implementing
- [04:47] something similar we can link to those
- [04:48] implementation doc as a reference and
- [04:51] second part is system folder. So system
- [04:53] folder contains things like project
- [04:55] structure, the database schema, your
- [04:56] APIs or some critical and complex part
- [04:59] of your codebase and those things can go
- [05:01] across different individual PRDs and
- [05:04] really useful for agent to get a overall
- [05:05] understanding and this is also the part
- [05:07] that it can grow bigger and bigger and
- [05:09] third is SOPs. This is where we will log
- [05:11] the standard process for doing certain
- [05:13] things or mistakes you saw agent make.
- [05:15] So after I get agent do something, I
- [05:17] will ask it to generate a SOP for this
- [05:19] specific process. It can be as generic
- [05:21] as like adding a new database table,
- [05:23] what are the list of action you should
- [05:24] take to something more granular like how
- [05:26] to integrate a new replicate model. And
- [05:29] last but not least also a readme file.
- [05:31] So as your codebase became more and more
- [05:33] complicated, there'll be just so many
- [05:35] docs and the readme here is almost like
- [05:37] index of all documentation files you
- [05:39] have and when to read which
- [05:40] documentation file. So the agent can
- [05:42] quickly get an overview of all the
- [05:44] relevant documentations and read
- [05:45] injection history. So this is a common
- [05:48] documentation system I often use.
- [05:50] Meanwhile, I also uses update doc
- [05:52] command quite frequently. What it does
- [05:54] is that it basically includes certain
- [05:56] instructions to agent about what to do
- [05:58] when initialize documentation structure
- [06:00] as well as when I need to update
- [06:01] documentation. So I will run this
- [06:03] command after I implement certain
- [06:04] features or I can use this update doc
- [06:06] command after we help agent correct
- [06:08] certain mistakes so we don't make same
- [06:10] mistakes again. Then it will create this
- [06:12] SOP that clearly list out all the
- [06:14] step-by-step process and also the
- [06:15] related documentations so the agent can
- [06:18] consume more relevant information and
- [06:20] this SOP doc will also be included in
- [06:22] the readme.md. So this is pretty common
- [06:24] structure I use for my projects and
- [06:26] continuously maintain and updating them.
- [06:28] Obviously the best version of
- [06:29] documentation system is always something
- [06:31] tailored to your codebase. For example,
- [06:33] I talked to Simon from AI builder club
- [06:35] where he showcased how he builds a whole
- [06:37] documentation system with his team for
- [06:39] their Lexi codebase. This is the pointer
- [06:41] dock as it were that points to
- [06:42] everything um how we do all sorts of
- [06:45] things and you know best practices
- [06:48] um etc. [laughter] And so this is very
- [06:50] human readable obviously as well but it
- [06:53] is it was designed more for our LLM
- [06:57] friends. We document all the ways we do
- [07:00] our like migrations how we store the
- [07:03] data. We got a whole class of things
- [07:05] with methods for helpers, updators,
- [07:09] utilities, all sorts of stuff like that.
- [07:11] We've sort of split out all that all
- [07:13] this stuff into well doumented sections.
- [07:17] >> The very first versions of these we did
- [07:19] inside Claude. We got Claude to generate
- [07:22] the MD files and then we started using
- [07:24] cursor and we've got our own little uh
- [07:27] this thing here. All right.
- [07:28] >> What what are they these things are
- [07:30] called? Now cursor now has got the slash
- [07:33] commands. I haven't yet experimented
- [07:35] with turning this into a slash command
- [07:37] because I've always found this rather
- [07:38] frustrating that we've only got so
- [07:40] [laughter] much room to see what's going
- [07:42] on in there.
- [07:43] >> But it's not complicated. We go through
- [07:45] and then we say review this class
- [07:48] >> and
- [07:50] upgrade the inline documentation. So we
- [07:53] do that first so that then the class has
- [07:57] got the best possible inline
- [07:58] documentation and then we'll use a a
- [08:01] prompt in the prompt interface to
- [08:04] generate the class documentation in more
- [08:08] detail. So there's this workflow that
- [08:10] goes generate or update the inline
- [08:12] documentation and then output that into
- [08:14] the bigger documentation. So I've just
- [08:17] thrown all the LLMs at this to sort of
- [08:19] get as best as we can. It makes the
- [08:22] whole process easier to manage by
- [08:24] exposing all of that.
- [08:25] >> And let me give you a quick example of
- [08:27] how do I do it. If I start a new
- [08:28] project, let's firstly create cloud.md
- [08:30] file. I just added one section for docs
- [08:33] specifically explain the doc structure
- [08:35] we want agent to follow and then give a
- [08:37] rules that we always update agent folder
- [08:39] docs after we implement certain features
- [08:41] and before we plan any implementation
- [08:42] always raise the ray me first to get the
- [08:45] full context and meanwhile I will also
- [08:47] create a doc cloud folder commands
- [08:49] update doc. MD. This is a simple prompt
- [08:52] that specifically telling agent about
- [08:54] the dock structure and what to do when
- [08:56] we start initialize the doc and what to
- [08:58] do when we ask to update doc as well as
- [09:00] some very specific rules when it create
- [09:02] new doc files. I'm going to show you how
- [09:03] we use this setup to continuously update
- [09:06] docs. So I firstly do /update doc
- [09:08] initialize. This will race through my
- [09:10] current project and try to set up a do
- [09:12] agent folder structure. And once it
- [09:14] finish you will see that it creates this
- [09:16] agent folder and set up a project
- [09:18] architecture as a first doc. And there's
- [09:20] also a readme file under the dot agent
- [09:22] folder which listing out all the docs
- [09:24] that we have. Now let's just take you
- [09:26] through example of how do we use this.
- [09:28] Let's say we want to build a basic app
- [09:29] that can do text to image generation
- [09:31] using a model host on replicate. So I'm
- [09:33] going to copy over a doc and give
- [09:35] prompt. How we build a text to image app
- [09:38] using model above and I'm going to use a
- [09:40] plan mode. And after I finish the plan
- [09:42] I'm going to prompt a save
- [09:43] implementation plan in a do agent/task
- [09:45] folder and start implementation.
- [09:49] Great. Okay, now we have this text to
- [09:50] image model working. Quite often in my
- [09:52] experience, model will fail to integrate
- [09:54] replicated model out of box and that's
- [09:56] where R can use this update doc command
- [09:59] saying generate SOP integrating
- [10:01] replicate model. Then what it will do is
- [10:03] that it will create this replicated
- [10:05] model integration SOP. In this doc, it
- [10:07] will explain specifically step-by-step
- [10:09] integration process, the directory
- [10:11] structure should follow and also there's
- [10:13] a section called related documentations.
- [10:15] So for this one probably didn't make
- [10:16] perfect sense but you can imagine if
- [10:18] your documentation became more and more
- [10:20] complicated. This can be used as a
- [10:22] directory to lead to all related
- [10:24] documents and in the end it will also go
- [10:26] update the readme as well to include
- [10:28] more stuff. So now I can even clear the
- [10:30] conversation without giving too much
- [10:32] context and give different model which
- [10:33] is text to video and give a prompt help
- [10:35] me add text to video capability using
- [10:37] model above plan implementation and read
- [10:39] do agent doc first for context and again
- [10:42] I'm using the plan mode. This time you
- [10:44] can see it reading through different
- [10:45] files to get the full picture. And we're
- [10:48] going to do the same thing. Save the
- [10:49] implementation plan to /task folder and
- [10:52] start implementing. With this one is
- [10:53] able to oneshot this video generation
- [10:55] model and it is fully functional without
- [10:58] any errors. So this how you can imagine
- [11:00] this whole documentation system works.
- [11:03] You can have higher confidence that I
- [11:04] can just come in any time and start
- [11:06] implementing something with pretty
- [11:08] consistent performance. You can do same
- [11:10] thing for your existing codebase as well
- [11:12] to ask cloud code start generating the
- [11:13] system architecture documentations which
- [11:16] can including text project architecture
- [11:18] as well as database schema API endpoint
- [11:20] and many more. If you're interested we
- [11:21] have a specific session in AI builder
- [11:23] club where we include detailed
- [11:24] instructions of the cloudd and update do
- [11:27] commands that you can copy paste as well
- [11:29] as a 1h hour workshop where Simon dive
- [11:31] deeper into his specific setup. So you
- [11:34] can learn how others are generating
- [11:35] documentation system for big and complex
- [11:37] codebase. I have put the link in the
- [11:39] description below for you to join AI
