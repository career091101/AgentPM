- [00:00] Hey guys, MCP has quickly become the
- [00:02] standard for connecting tools to your AI
- [00:05] agents. Which is why in today's video,
- [00:06] I'm going to be giving you a crash
- [00:08] course on connecting MCP to agent
- [00:11] development kit so that you can
- [00:13] supercharge your ADK agents with real
- [00:15] world tools that actually work. And I
- [00:17] know MCP can feel complex and
- [00:19] overwhelming at first, which is why in
- [00:21] today's video, we're going to break
- [00:22] everything down step by step in three
- [00:24] different phases. In phase one, we're
- [00:26] going to hop over to the whiteboard and
- [00:28] break everything down so you can
- [00:29] understand what is MCP, how it works,
- [00:31] and so you can see why MCP is so
- [00:34] powerful with Agent Development Kit. In
- [00:36] phase two, we're going to actually dive
- [00:38] into some code where you're going to see
- [00:40] how we can connect an ADK agent up to a
- [00:43] remote tool that's all done with MCP.
- [00:45] And then in phase three, you're going to
- [00:47] see everything end to end where we're
- [00:49] going to actually create a local MCP
- [00:51] server on our own computer and connect
- [00:53] it to an ADK agent so you can understand
- [00:56] how they work together and create your
- [00:58] own custom MCP servers. And to make
- [01:00] things even easier for you guys, I'm
- [01:01] going to be giving away all the source
- [01:03] code for all the different examples
- [01:04] you're going to see in today's video
- [01:05] completely for free. Just click that
- [01:07] first link in the description below so
- [01:08] you can download all the source code.
- [01:10] So, if you're serious about becoming an
- [01:11] AI developer, you're going to want to
- [01:12] stick through this whole video because
- [01:14] MCP has become a core foundational
- [01:17] technology in building real world AI
- [01:19] agents. And this is the video that's
- [01:21] going to catch you up to speed super
- [01:22] fast. So, with all that out of the way,
- [01:24] let's go ahead and hop over to the
- [01:25] whiteboard so you guys can understand
- [01:27] what is MCP, how it works, and why it's
- [01:30] such an amazing tool to use with Agent
- [01:31] Development Kit. Oh, and real quick. If
- [01:33] you're looking to get help on your AI
- [01:35] projects or if you'd like to meet
- [01:36] like-minded AI developers, I definitely
- [01:38] recommend checking out the free school
- [01:40] community I've created for you guys. We
- [01:41] have over 7,000 members and free weekly
- [01:43] coaching calls and a bunch of extra
- [01:44] bonus materials. So, definitely
- [01:46] recommend you joining and I cannot wait
- [01:47] to see you guys on our weekly Tuesday
- [01:49] coaching calls. But enough of that.
- [01:50] Let's get back to the video. Okay guys,
- [01:52] so welcome to phase one where we're
- [01:54] going to do a quick crash course on all
- [01:56] things MCP. Now, before we dive in, I
- [01:58] just want to mention that MCP confused
- [02:00] the heck out of me. The first few times
- [02:02] I heard about it, I didn't understand
- [02:04] why we would need it. I actually just
- [02:06] was like, "Oh, that seems pointless.
- [02:07] It's so much extra work just to use
- [02:09] tools. I'm not even going to work with
- [02:10] it." That was my thought process for the
- [02:12] longest time. But after continually
- [02:14] working with it over and over again, I
- [02:16] now am a firm believer in MCP and I
- [02:19] understand why it's such a powerful
- [02:21] tool. So that's why in this section, I'm
- [02:24] going to cover some of the major
- [02:25] problems with traditional tool calling
- [02:27] so that you can understand why MCP is so
- [02:29] powerful and you need to use it as well.
- [02:31] And to make things as easy to understand
- [02:32] as possible, I've done my best to
- [02:34] include a few different examples so you
- [02:36] can see what tool calling looks like
- [02:38] without MCP and all the benefits, but
- [02:41] most importantly the cons of not using
- [02:43] MCP so that when we hop over to looking
- [02:45] at MCP, you go, "Oh, I now understand
- [02:48] why MCP is so powerful and why I should
- [02:50] use it as well." So, we're going to be
- [02:52] covering all that in this crash course
- [02:53] so we have a good foundation before we
- [02:55] dive into actually start using it inside
- [02:57] of Agent Development Kit. So, let's
- [02:59] start at the top. And don't worry if it
- [03:00] doesn't click instantly. It took me
- [03:02] forever to learn it. So, I'm going to be
- [03:04] breaking things down part by part. So,
- [03:06] don't worry if it doesn't make sense
- [03:07] till the end of phase one because
- [03:09] there's a lot of moving parts. So, long
- [03:11] story short, what the heck is model
- [03:13] context protocol or MCP? In a nutshell,
- [03:15] it's just a standardized way for AI
- [03:17] agents to connect to external tools.
- [03:20] More simply, what it's really doing
- [03:22] under the hood is MCP is just a server
- [03:25] that is a standardized way for you to
- [03:28] access common real world AI tools that
- [03:31] you want to pass to your agents. This
- [03:33] MCP server, what it does in a
- [03:35] standardized way is it allows you to
- [03:37] connect up tools to your agent. So, it's
- [03:39] one server that connects to your agent
- [03:41] and this one server goes, "Hey, I'm
- [03:43] connected to all sorts of tools." And
- [03:44] for each tool, I could allow you to call
- [03:47] this tool. I could list out all the
- [03:48] tools you have access to or if you want
- [03:51] more information on a tool, I can
- [03:52] describe it for you so you can see what
- [03:54] arguments you need to pass to this tool
- [03:56] and what this tool is going to return
- [03:57] to. So, it's just a standardized way.
- [03:59] Now, that's the key thing. Standardized
- [04:01] way to connect with tools. And this will
- [04:03] make more sense as we dive deeper and
- [04:05] after we compare traditional tool
- [04:07] calling to MCP tool calling. It will
- [04:09] click. It's just going to take a second
- [04:10] to get there. So let's imagine for this
- [04:12] example to help us better understand
- [04:14] traditional tool calling. Let's imagine
- [04:15] we were building an ADK agent that was
- [04:18] going to connect to notion. Notion, if
- [04:19] you've never used it before, it's just a
- [04:21] productivity tool where you can write
- [04:22] documents and create databases. Super
- [04:25] powerful tool. But let's just imagine
- [04:26] for this example, we were creating an
- [04:28] ADK agent that worked with this notion
- [04:31] tool. Now, under the hood, if you wanted
- [04:33] to traditionally allow this agent to
- [04:35] work with notion, it would be up to you
- [04:37] to for every single API call you could
- [04:41] use with notion, such as like, oh, I
- [04:43] want to query a database. I want to
- [04:45] create a page. I want to add a comment.
- [04:46] For each one of these API endpoints that
- [04:48] you would normally have to create a tool
- [04:50] around, it would be up to you to write
- [04:51] the tool. Now, what this would look like
- [04:53] in traditional tool calling is you would
- [04:56] have your agent. You would give it
- [04:57] instructions and for every tool you
- [05:00] wanted to use, you would make the tool
- [05:02] just like this. And then you would just
- [05:04] continually add all your tools right
- [05:06] here inside the agent. So, this list
- [05:08] would just keep growing on and on with
- [05:10] more and more tools. And every time you
- [05:12] wanted to do add a new tool, you would
- [05:13] just do something like this. Super
- [05:15] straightforward to use, makes a ton of
- [05:17] sense, and it's a really easy way to get
- [05:19] started adding tools to your agents. But
- [05:21] the problem is going back to our notion
- [05:22] example is there's a ton of different
- [05:24] API calls that you would have to write
- [05:27] in order to work with notion. So if we
- [05:29] just head over to the notion documents,
- [05:31] you can see there's a ton of different
- [05:33] endpoints. So for creating a page or
- [05:35] just working with pages, you have to
- [05:37] work on creating pages, retrieving
- [05:38] pages, getting page information,
- [05:40] updating page properties. There's a ton
- [05:42] of different API endpoints. And for each
- [05:45] one of these API endpoints, it's up to
- [05:47] you to basically write all the code
- [05:50] around this command right here. So it
- [05:52] would, you know, we would be using
- [05:53] Python obviously, but for each different
- [05:55] endpoint, it would be up to you to make
- [05:57] a wrapper around this client and say,
- [06:00] okay, hey, I want to make a tool for
- [06:02] creating pages in notion. And it would
- [06:04] be up to you to basically wrap this
- [06:06] around in a tool that you could then
- [06:08] pass over to your agents. So this is
- [06:10] just a ton of redundant work. But the
- [06:12] good news is once you've created that
- [06:13] tool, it's super easy to use and pass
- [06:16] into your agent. So super simple to
- [06:18] create, but it's really redundant
- [06:20] because let's imagine in project one you
- [06:23] had this agent right here that worked
- [06:25] with notion. And it's super easy if you
- [06:27] have another agent in that same project
- [06:30] that also you want to use notion with.
- [06:32] Cuz what you would do is just go, okay,
- [06:33] all right, agent one and agent two or
- [06:36] agent A and agent B, I have a shared
- [06:38] tool library where you can access all
- [06:40] those notion tools. I just created for
- [06:42] all 30 different commands you can work
- [06:44] with different commands with notion. I
- [06:46] put them all here in this one notion.py
- [06:48] file and you can call all the 30
- [06:50] different tools. Super easy to share the
- [06:51] tools. But here's where things begin to
- [06:53] break. Let's imagine you are working on
- [06:56] a second project where you also want to
- [06:58] start to interface and use notion. Well,
- [07:00] how the heck do you allow this agent to
- [07:03] use all the different Notion tools you
- [07:05] just created in your other project? The
- [07:07] short answer is you have to copy this
- [07:09] notion.py PI file and paste it over
- [07:12] here. And once you do that, you can now
- [07:14] allow this agent to start using the tool
- [07:16] as well. So you're pretty much, you
- [07:18] know, not being a good programmer
- [07:19] because you're not following the dry
- [07:20] principle, which was don't repeat
- [07:21] yourself cuz you're 100% repeating all
- [07:23] the code right here that was over here.
- [07:25] So super easy to create the tool, but
- [07:28] super redundant. And you know, at a
- [07:30] macro level, what I mean by it's
- [07:32] redundant is if I'm wanting to use the
- [07:34] notion API tool, I'm creating the same
- [07:37] tools. if you're going to use the notion
- [07:39] API, you're also stuck creating, you
- [07:41] know, hundreds of lines of code just to
- [07:43] use the notion API. So, it's redundant
- [07:45] at a macro level because every single
- [07:46] developer who wants to use Notion is
- [07:48] stuck recreating all the tools, which at
- [07:51] the end of the day, they're just
- [07:52] wrapping all of the different commands
- [07:54] that you get when using the Notion
- [07:56] client. So, it's super redundant. So,
- [07:59] what I want to do next is start to go
- [08:00] over to MCP land and start to explain
- [08:03] what is actually happening when we start
- [08:05] to use MCP instead. So with MCP what you
- [08:09] get to do is you go all right agent same
- [08:12] agent you go I want to start to work
- [08:15] with notion. Notion has those 30
- [08:17] different endpoints that we can do to
- [08:19] start to work with our documents where
- [08:21] we can query the database add comments.
- [08:23] And what I want to do is I want you to
- [08:26] have access to the notion MCP server.
- [08:29] And what this MCP server does is it
- [08:31] wraps all of the different API endpoints
- [08:34] that you would normally have to create
- [08:36] tools for and they just automatically do
- [08:38] it for you. So notion has one server
- [08:40] that every single AI developer anywhere
- [08:43] can use to start to interface with
- [08:44] notion. So this comes back to the
- [08:46] standardized way of allowing AI agents
- [08:48] to use tools. It's just a standard
- [08:50] interface for accessing tools. So here's
- [08:53] what this would look like. So if you hop
- [08:55] over to their MCP server that they have
- [08:57] set up. So you can see notion has an MCP
- [09:00] server inside this server. What they do
- [09:02] is they allow you to easily interface
- [09:05] with all things when it comes to notion.
- [09:07] And more specifically what they have
- [09:09] done under the hood because this is the
- [09:11] important part is for every single
- [09:13] possible command you can send over to
- [09:15] notion such as creating a page or
- [09:17] creating a database or updating a
- [09:20] database. Every single command they have
- [09:22] actually wrapped it inside of an MCP
- [09:24] server. Now here's the beauty of this.
- [09:26] What's going to happen now is our agent
- [09:28] is going to say, "Okay, MCP server, I
- [09:31] can see I've added a subserver that you
- [09:34] need to interface with." And you can
- [09:35] say, "All right, agent, can you please
- [09:36] tell me what tools I have access to?"
- [09:38] And this MCP server is going to go,
- [09:40] "Okay, well, right now I'm only
- [09:42] connected to one server." So, I'm just
- [09:44] going to call this server and say, "Hey,
- [09:45] please tell me what tools you have
- [09:46] access to." And this notion MCP server
- [09:48] is going to respond saying, "Hey, I have
- [09:50] the ability to query databases, write
- [09:52] comments, and create pages." And all
- [09:54] this information is going to get passed
- [09:55] back to your AI agent. And whenever you
- [09:57] tell your agent, say, "Hey, I would like
- [09:59] to create a new page." What's going to
- [10:01] happen is this MCP server is going to
- [10:03] go, "Oh, it looks like you're trying to
- [10:04] do a tool call and this tool call
- [10:06] belongs to the MCP server for notion.
- [10:08] I'm now going to allow you to create a
- [10:10] page." So, it's just one standardized
- [10:12] way of interfacing with tools. Now, what
- [10:14] does this actually look like in
- [10:15] Codeland? Because I thought this was one
- [10:17] of the biggest things I didn't
- [10:18] understand at first. So here's just a
- [10:20] dummy file for what it looks like to
- [10:22] make agents inside of ADK that connect
- [10:25] to MCP tools. So in our case, we are
- [10:28] trying to work with notion. So we're
- [10:30] saying, all right, agent, I would like
- [10:32] to add a model context protocol tool
- [10:35] set. This tool set is going to connect
- [10:37] to a server. This server in this case is
- [10:40] going to be the notion MCP server. And
- [10:43] in order to run this server, I'm going
- [10:45] to run the command npx, which is like
- [10:47] the node package manager for running an
- [10:49] executable. And what it's doing in a
- [10:51] nutshell, don't worry, we're going to
- [10:52] dive into it deeper later on, is we're
- [10:53] saying, "Hey, I would like to run this
- [10:56] server right here, and I would just like
- [10:58] to run it on my local computer." And
- [11:00] what this is doing is it's just on your
- [11:02] local computer. It's spinning up a
- [11:04] server, and this server is going to have
- [11:06] access to all of the different API
- [11:09] commands that Notion gives us. So, don't
- [11:11] worry if this didn't make a ton of sense
- [11:12] at first. We're going to dive much
- [11:14] deeper into it throughout the rest of
- [11:15] the video. But the key takeaway here is
- [11:17] MCP servers, they're nothing more than
- [11:19] just a wrapper around common tools. So,
- [11:21] let's dive into some of the benefits of
- [11:23] this. So, the major benefit when it
- [11:25] comes to using MCP is that all of the
- [11:28] tools that we're going to use such as
- [11:30] Slack, notion, working with common
- [11:32] databases, all of these tools are have
- [11:34] MCP servers now. So just by simply
- [11:37] creating a new tool, you can just say,
- [11:39] "All right, I now want to work with the
- [11:40] Slack tool." And then you can connect it
- [11:42] to your MCP server and then boom, you
- [11:45] instantly have access to Slack or you
- [11:47] can say, "I want to start working with
- [11:49] this browser tool." Okay, cool. You just
- [11:52] instantly hook it up to your MCP server
- [11:54] and now you can start to work with a
- [11:56] browser tool. And what's amazing is
- [11:58] instead of you having to recreate all
- [12:00] those API commands you normally have to
- [12:02] do and create tools, this just instantly
- [12:04] goes and gives you access to all those
- [12:06] different tools and really just
- [12:07] supercharges your agent to allow it to
- [12:09] do a ton of work. So there are a few
- [12:11] cons of creating MCP servers that you're
- [12:13] going to see later on such as like you
- [12:16] need to actually just instead of you
- [12:18] saying hey here's a tool and I'm just
- [12:20] going to add it. There's some additional
- [12:22] setup that you have to do. So, that's
- [12:24] the biggest con of working with MCP,
- [12:26] especially if you're going to create
- [12:27] custom tools. You have to do, you know,
- [12:29] basically set up a custom server on your
- [12:31] local computer. I'm going to walk you
- [12:32] through that in phase three, but just
- [12:34] know that it's, you know, there's a
- [12:36] little bit more setup, but if you're
- [12:37] using industrial tools that are just
- [12:39] your enterprise tools that are super
- [12:40] common, MCP is a godsend because you
- [12:42] just say, I'm using Notion and boom, in
- [12:44] two clicks, you're automatically
- [12:46] connected to Notion and just got instant
- [12:47] access to 30 different tools that you
- [12:49] can now supercharge your agent with. So
- [12:51] main thing, don't worry. We're going to
- [12:52] dive deeper into actually working with
- [12:54] Notion in a second. So you're going to
- [12:55] see all of this. Don't worry. But the
- [12:57] main thing that I just want to say, if
- [12:59] you're going to use a super common API,
- [13:02] the answer is use MCP. MCP is going to
- [13:04] make your life so much easier when it
- [13:06] comes to working with agents. If you're
- [13:07] rapidly experimenting with some custom
- [13:09] tools locally that you're trying to just
- [13:11] create for a proof of concept, I would
- [13:13] stay away from MCP because it's going to
- [13:15] make setting up your server a lot more
- [13:16] work and it's going to be a little bit
- [13:18] more work for not much value. But if
- [13:20] you're creating something that you're
- [13:21] going to use across a ton of your
- [13:22] different projects or you want to allow
- [13:24] others to use, the answer is use MCP. So
- [13:27] don't worry if you have any questions on
- [13:28] any of that, drop a comment down below.
- [13:30] And as we actually hump over in phase
- [13:32] two to where we start to use a real
- [13:34] world MCP server, I think this is going
- [13:36] to make a lot more sense. And when we
- [13:37] really in phase three create an end
- [13:39] to-end server, a lot of this will click.
- [13:41] So don't worry if a lot of this isn't
- [13:42] making sense right now. I promise you it
- [13:44] will, especially the second you start to
- [13:46] see this run in action. So, let's go
- [13:47] ahead hop over to phase two and connect
- [13:49] your first agent up to an MCP server so
- [13:51] you can see everything working end to
- [13:52] end. All right, guys. Welcome to part
- [13:54] two where you're going to learn how to
- [13:56] connect your first MCP tool up to an ADK
- [14:00] agent. And in this part, we're going to
- [14:02] first break down some of the most common
- [14:05] places you can go to find MCP servers
- [14:08] that have access to all the different
- [14:09] tools you want to use. Then we're going
- [14:11] to do a little bit of a deeper dive to
- [14:13] look at notion because once you
- [14:14] understand one MCP tool, you really
- [14:16] understand them all. And then finally,
- [14:17] we're going to run this agent so you can
- [14:20] see how it actually interacts with MCP
- [14:23] servers. Okay, so let's first dive over
- [14:25] to working and looking at all the
- [14:28] different servers that you can access.
- [14:29] So the first one, which is the most
- [14:31] common one, is to look at the model
- [14:33] context protocol. There's a GitHub
- [14:35] repository that has links to all the
- [14:37] common servers that you can use. So you
- [14:39] can see this is a huge page. So you can
- [14:41] see, hey, here's a bunch of different
- [14:43] reference servers that you can look at.
- [14:44] Everything from connecting to GitHub,
- [14:46] everything to Google Drive, Google Maps,
- [14:49] databases, web browsers, all sorts of
- [14:52] different tools. And you know, the list
- [14:53] keeps going on and on and on with all
- [14:56] sorts of common tools that you can
- [14:58] access. I do want to just quickly peek
- [14:59] at one so you can see what it looks
- [15:01] like. So let's imagine we wanted to
- [15:03] connect up to, in our case, let's just
- [15:05] say Google Maps. Well, when you want to
- [15:09] use an MCP server, here's pretty much
- [15:11] what it looks like. An MCP server has a
- [15:14] set of tools because that's what you
- [15:16] remember. It's a unified MCP is just a
- [15:18] unified way for agents to access tools.
- [15:21] So, it's obviously going to list out all
- [15:23] the different tools that we can use once
- [15:24] we connect up to this server, the
- [15:26] expected purpose of the tool, the
- [15:28] inputs, and what it returns. So, it's
- [15:30] just listing it all out at a high level.
- [15:32] And then for each MCP server, you will
- [15:35] notice that it gives you instructions on
- [15:38] how to actually use the tool. Now,
- [15:40] whenever I first saw these different
- [15:42] types of setup instructions like this,
- [15:45] at first I was like, this is so
- [15:46] confusing, like what what am I actually
- [15:48] doing? And it took a second. But the key
- [15:50] lesson here is there are multiple ways
- [15:53] to run a server. For example, you can
- [15:55] run a server by running docker. This
- [15:58] will spin up a Docker container and then
- [16:00] you're just passing in a bunch of
- [16:02] instructions to run a Docker container
- [16:05] that runs the MCP Google Map server.
- [16:08] That's all this is doing is it's just on
- [16:10] your local computer. It's spinning up a
- [16:12] local server that just waits for your
- [16:14] agents to send requests to it. That's
- [16:16] all this is doing. So this is a Docker
- [16:18] example of doing it. Or you can do like
- [16:21] the other approach which is using npx.
- [16:23] So node package executables where all
- [16:25] this is doing is the exact same thing.
- [16:27] It's just creating and running a server
- [16:29] that's running locally on your computer
- [16:31] that's running this package right here.
- [16:33] So, all it's doing is just a local
- [16:34] server that's just sitting there waiting
- [16:37] for your agents to ask what tools it has
- [16:39] to describe a tool or to call a tool.
- [16:41] That's all that's going on. So, don't
- [16:43] let this confuse you. All the complexity
- [16:45] of all the arguments. All it's doing is
- [16:47] it's running a Google Maps server on
- [16:50] your local computer so that your agents
- [16:51] can make requests to it. And the other
- [16:53] thing that you'll notice is there's
- [16:54] really three parts to these different
- [16:56] types of commands to run an MCP server.
- [16:59] The first thing is the command. So how
- [17:01] do you want to run this? You know, what
- [17:02] command are you trying to use to run the
- [17:04] server? And the most common commands
- [17:06] you'll see are docker to create a Docker
- [17:08] container. You'll see npx to run a node
- [17:11] package executable or you can see it
- [17:13] actually run Python. In part three of
- [17:15] this tutorial, you're going to see how
- [17:16] we create a Python server. But just to
- [17:18] know, you know, these are the three most
- [17:20] common commands you'll see. Then after
- [17:22] you type in a command, what you'll
- [17:24] notice is it passes in arguments. These
- [17:26] arguments are nothing more than the
- [17:28] commands needed to properly spin up the
- [17:30] server. So in this case, it's running an
- [17:32] interactive container that's using
- [17:35] Google Maps and it's expecting to see an
- [17:38] environment variable for the Google Maps
- [17:40] API key. That's all this is saying for
- [17:42] Docker. And then when it comes to node
- [17:43] package manager, what it's saying is
- [17:45] like hey please use node package
- [17:47] executables and I would like to run this
- [17:51] library package right here and I want to
- [17:53] say dashy which mean accept all
- [17:56] different props that get passed up. So
- [17:58] like usually what will happen when you
- [17:59] run npx is it'll install stuff and it's
- [18:02] going to say yes I automatically want to
- [18:03] install whatever you need to run this
- [18:05] server. And then finally, in order to
- [18:07] properly run this server, I'm going to
- [18:09] pass in the same Google Maps environment
- [18:11] variables into this server so that I
- [18:13] can, you know, properly make the
- [18:14] necessary commands. So this is you'll
- [18:17] see this. It doesn't matter what server
- [18:18] you're looking at. That one was Google
- [18:20] Maps. If you're using Slack, you're
- [18:22] going to notice the exact same thing.
- [18:24] You're going to see tools. And then
- [18:26] after you get done with all the tools,
- [18:28] you're going to see once again the same
- [18:30] ways to spin up a server. Node package
- [18:32] manager or Docker. And then all it's
- [18:34] going to do is say, "Yep, I want to run
- [18:36] this node package, and here's a link to
- [18:39] the library." And you can actually go to
- [18:41] GitHub and actually dig deeper into this
- [18:43] if you'd wanted to. Same for Docker. Run
- [18:45] a Docker container, make it interactive.
- [18:48] Here's some environment variables, and
- [18:49] here's the actual container that you
- [18:51] need to download and run. So, long story
- [18:53] short, we're just running servers on our
- [18:54] local computer that our agents are going
- [18:56] to talk to. Hopefully, that makes sense.
- [18:58] So, this is one area where you can see a
- [19:00] bunch of different MCP servers. The
- [19:02] other one is called Smithery. Either one
- [19:05] of these just gives you access to a ton
- [19:07] of different, you know, MCP servers that
- [19:09] you can look up to. So, these are all
- [19:11] amazing ones I definitely recommend
- [19:13] checking out. Okay. In our case though,
- [19:15] what we're trying to do is work with
- [19:17] Notion. So, in our case, I have provided
- [19:19] some links right here in this file that
- [19:21] you can download completely for free to
- [19:23] where you can see all the different
- [19:24] information for all the servers we just
- [19:26] looked at and specifically Notion cuz
- [19:28] this is the one that we're going to be
- [19:29] using. So, if you hop over to Notion,
- [19:32] what you'll see is here's the official
- [19:34] Notion document GitHub repository, and
- [19:36] we're looking at their MCP server. And
- [19:38] their MCP server has some setup
- [19:40] instructions for us to walk us through
- [19:42] exactly how to run our MCP server. So,
- [19:46] in our case, what you would have noticed
- [19:47] in every time we run an MCP server. So,
- [19:49] let me actually hop back to our code. In
- [19:51] our case, and what we're trying to do is
- [19:53] run a node package manage executable to
- [19:56] run our notion MCP server. And in our
- [19:58] case, we need to pass in environment
- [20:00] variables. And in our case, we mostly
- [20:02] are just trying to pass in our notion
- [20:04] API key. So in our case, to get our
- [20:06] notion API key, you can just follow
- [20:08] these readme instructions, and it'll
- [20:10] show you how to actually set up
- [20:12] everything that you need to create
- [20:14] credentials. You pretty much want to
- [20:16] check all these boxes so that you can
- [20:18] actually write data to your notion or
- [20:20] read data from notion. And then once
- [20:22] you've created the application and you
- [20:24] got the API key, you just invite
- [20:27] whatever you know whatever different
- [20:29] pages and databases you want to have
- [20:31] access to. You just say yes, I would
- [20:34] like to make a connection to this page
- [20:36] and here's my MCP server. So just follow
- [20:39] these. It's super super straightforward.
- [20:40] Trust me. And once this is all done,
- [20:43] we're going to end up with a page just
- [20:44] like this. So we're about to run this
- [20:46] code, but I just want to show you how
- [20:47] straightforward it is. So in our case,
- [20:49] we're saying, all right, I would like to
- [20:51] create an agent. I'm calling this my
- [20:53] notion MCP agent. When it comes to the
- [20:56] actual commands, just say you're an
- [20:58] helpful assistant. Take initiative.
- [21:00] Basically, help me run all sorts of
- [21:03] different queries against my notion
- [21:05] database, you know, and you'll see it in
- [21:07] just a second. And then finally, the
- [21:09] most important part is actually using
- [21:11] MCP. So every time you want to hook up
- [21:14] your agent to a different set of MCPS
- [21:16] servers, all you just type in is MCP
- [21:19] tool set. Then you pass in the
- [21:21] connection parameters and then you can
- [21:22] run whatever you want right here. So if
- [21:24] you wanted to use use Docker, you could
- [21:26] put Docker here. If you wanted to use
- [21:28] Node Package Manager, you could use that
- [21:30] one. So it's just you can add as many as
- [21:33] you want right here, which is nice cuz
- [21:34] it's so easy to just with this one
- [21:36] single command instantly add 30
- [21:38] different tools to our agent. Super
- [21:40] straightforward. And then finally, we're
- [21:42] passing environment variables in. So
- [21:44] what we're going to do now is we're
- [21:45] going to run this agent so you can see
- [21:47] it in action and actually start to see
- [21:49] the power of MCP with your ADK agents.
- [21:51] So what you'll notice is right now we
- [21:54] have three different packages in here.
- [21:56] We have a demo comparison. We have a
- [21:58] local MCP and a remote MCP. Right now
- [22:01] we're inside the remote MCP package
- [22:03] where we're just trying to use our
- [22:04] notion agents. So what we can do is go
- [22:06] ahead and once you've followed the
- [22:08] readme and installed all the necessary
- [22:10] requirements, you can run the command ad
- [22:13] web. And this will spin up a local
- [22:15] server on our computer to where we can
- [22:17] start to run our agents. So we're going
- [22:20] to open it up. And now I'm going to walk
- [22:22] you through actually starting to use our
- [22:24] first agent that connects up to MCP. So
- [22:27] let's go ahead and start taking this bad
- [22:28] boy for a run. And to make things easier
- [22:30] to view, I just went and put everything
- [22:31] full screen. So what can we do? Well, if
- [22:33] you remember back to our initial
- [22:35] whiteboard drawing, our MCP server
- [22:37] should allow us to list tools, call
- [22:39] tools, and describe tools. So, let's try
- [22:41] these out to see if it's properly
- [22:43] showing all the notion tools that we
- [22:45] have connected from our notion MCP
- [22:48] server. So, let's go ahead and say what
- [22:50] tools do you have access to. Now, what
- [22:54] you'll might notice is it's going to in
- [22:56] just a second it's going to show hey the
- [22:58] default API. So this is the single
- [23:00] endpoint that is the entry for our agent
- [23:03] to have access to all of the underlying
- [23:05] tools. So you can see when it comes to
- [23:07] underlying tools, we have the ability to
- [23:09] access a and retrieve all the different
- [23:13] pages and databases. We can search
- [23:15] databases. We can manage users. We can
- [23:18] create comments. We can do anything
- [23:19] inside of here. So I could also ask it
- [23:21] describe the search page tool. And what
- [23:26] this should do is you know call the
- [23:29] describe tool underlying call and
- [23:32] actually show us well hey for this tool
- [23:34] the API post search that's the tool we
- [23:37] would use I can see it lists out the
- [23:39] basically the purpose and the key
- [23:41] features and it also just it lists out
- [23:43] everything in regards to this tool so
- [23:46] that our agent would understand how to
- [23:47] properly call it. So hey the purpose of
- [23:49] this tool is to find notion pages or
- [23:51] databases. Here's basically the key
- [23:53] inputs, query, filter, sorting,
- [23:55] pagionation. These are all the
- [23:56] underlying things that you would
- [23:57] normally have to add if you were
- [23:59] creating the tool yourself. And then you
- [24:01] know it lists some limitations. All this
- [24:03] would have normally been added to the
- [24:04] doc string of this tool. But hey, the
- [24:06] MCP server whenever notion created this
- [24:08] MCP server, they added all this
- [24:10] information to our tool so we don't have
- [24:11] to do it. So let's actually go ahead and
- [24:13] start trying this out. I can say what
- [24:15] databases have I used recently. And what
- [24:18] this is going to do is look at my notion
- [24:20] and it's going to analyze which
- [24:22] different databases have I used. So in
- [24:24] my case, I've been using two. One is my
- [24:27] personal brand content engine. This is
- [24:28] where I store all of my ideas for
- [24:30] YouTube. And then the next one's
- [24:31] journal, which is where I just put all
- [24:32] of my thoughts. So I can say, what are
- [24:35] the most recent pages I've worked on in
- [24:39] the content engine? Give me the five
- [24:43] most recent. And then what this will do
- [24:44] is it should call our notion page. It
- [24:47] should make a custom query because if I
- [24:49] dive deeper into this query, you can see
- [24:51] it's actually like, hey, I want to make
- [24:53] sure we only get five pages. I want to
- [24:55] get the most recent ones and I only want
- [24:57] to do it for this database. So, you can
- [25:00] see it mapped agent development kit
- [25:02] mapped my English language to the proper
- [25:05] tool call that is hosted inside MCP. So,
- [25:08] you can see all right, you can see it
- [25:10] got back the results. So, here's the
- [25:11] five most recent ideas I've thought
- [25:13] about doing. So, yeah, how to make real
- [25:15] world AI apps. Five tips to code 10
- [25:18] times faster, how to create the perfect
- [25:19] prompts, MCP, that's the one you're
- [25:21] watching right now, and A28. So, you can
- [25:23] see it's actually showcasing the
- [25:25] different projects that I have inside of
- [25:27] my notion. So, let's do add a comment to
- [25:31] the MCP ADK crash course that says,
- [25:36] let's in our case, let's just say please
- [25:38] like and subscribe. And what this should
- [25:41] do is make an actual tool call in just a
- [25:43] second. So I will pull this down so you
- [25:46] guys can see it. So it should be this
- [25:47] appears to be two pages of this title.
- [25:49] Let's say just do use this one. Use this
- [25:51] one. And what this should do is now
- [25:54] officially make a call. So it should
- [25:56] create a comment. And let's move this
- [25:57] page down so you guys can see it in
- [25:59] action. So you can now see my MCP crash
- [26:01] course. This is the video I'm recording
- [26:02] right now. It actually officially added
- [26:04] a comment. So our agent called our MCP
- [26:07] server which then called notion and it
- [26:09] put like, "Hey, please like and
- [26:10] subscribe." So this bad boy is working
- [26:13] amazing. So yeah, this is just a quick
- [26:15] sneak peek of the power of using MCP to
- [26:18] connect your agents to, you know,
- [26:20] commonly used tools that can supercharge
- [26:23] your agents. And one of the main things
- [26:25] I just want to mention is if you ever
- [26:26] have questions on what's going on inside
- [26:28] of your agent, you can easily always
- [26:30] click these buttons right here to see,
- [26:32] hey, here's your agent. Here's all the
- [26:35] tools we're getting access to from using
- [26:36] this MCP server. And then whenever it
- [26:38] does call a tool, you can see it's the
- [26:40] selected one. And then you can dive
- [26:42] deeper into seeing the parameters passed
- [26:44] in for the function call. So this is all
- [26:46] the awesome parts that you know MCP
- [26:48] service for notion have done and you
- [26:50] know made our life so much easier for
- [26:52] actually interfacing with public and
- [26:53] enterprise different types of tools that
- [26:55] our agents can interface with. So yeah,
- [26:56] this is working with remote tools in a
- [26:59] nutshell. And what we're going to do in
- [27:01] part three is you're going to learn how
- [27:02] to actually create an MCP server
- [27:04] yourself so you can start to add your
- [27:06] own custom tools and provide those
- [27:09] custom tools to your agents all in a
- [27:11] standardized way using MCP. So let's hop
- [27:13] over to part number three. All right
- [27:14] guys, welcome to part three where you're
- [27:16] going to see how we can create a local
- [27:18] MCP server specifically where we're
- [27:21] going to have a ADK agent hooked up to a
- [27:24] local MCP server that we have running on
- [27:27] our computer. Now, this one's going to
- [27:29] be a little bit more involved on the
- [27:31] code side, but don't worry, I'm going to
- [27:32] walk you through everything at a high
- [27:33] level. And before we dive into the code,
- [27:35] I just want to mention the order that
- [27:36] we're going to do things so you can, you
- [27:39] know, follow along easy. So, first
- [27:40] things first, you're going to see how we
- [27:42] can create a local MCP server that will
- [27:45] run on our computer. Once we have that
- [27:47] MCP server up and running, you're going
- [27:49] to see how we can add in a bunch of
- [27:52] different tools to our MCP server.
- [27:54] Specifically, you're going to see how
- [27:55] we're trying to create a bunch of tools
- [27:58] that allow us to interact with a SQL
- [28:00] database on our local computer. So, we
- [28:02] just have a bunch of users and a bunch
- [28:03] of to-dos in this database. So, we
- [28:05] should be able to ask questions against
- [28:07] this database, such as like, hey, what
- [28:08] tables do you have? What's in a specific
- [28:11] table? Add data, delete data, all these
- [28:13] different tools that you can see right
- [28:14] here, we're going to add as tools to our
- [28:16] MCP server. Once we have our MCP server
- [28:20] up with all these different tools, we're
- [28:22] then going to create our agent and I'm
- [28:24] going to show you how you can connect
- [28:25] that agent to our MCP server. So, let's
- [28:27] hop over to the code and start seeing
- [28:30] how you can create your first local MCP
- [28:32] server. All right, so now it's time to
- [28:34] get our hands dirty as we dive into
- [28:36] setting up our local MCP server. And as
- [28:38] a quick reminder, you can download all
- [28:40] the source code you see right now
- [28:41] completely for free. Just click that
- [28:42] link down description below. But we're
- [28:44] mostly going to be working inside the
- [28:45] local MCP folder because this is the
- [28:47] folder that has access to our MCP server
- [28:50] which we're creating in the server.py.
- [28:52] It has access to our agent.py who's
- [28:54] going to making calls to our MCP server.
- [28:56] And then finally, this is where we have
- [28:58] our database. And just a quick reminder,
- [29:00] this database has access to our users
- [29:03] and it has access to our to-dos. So
- [29:06] ultimately, we just want our agent to be
- [29:07] able to make queries against this
- [29:09] database, add data, delete data,
- [29:11] everything about this database we're
- [29:12] trying to interface with for this simple
- [29:14] example. So what we're going to do is
- [29:15] start off in the server.py and we're
- [29:17] going to work our way from top to bottom
- [29:19] so you understand exactly what's going
- [29:20] on so that you can understand what we're
- [29:23] doing as we create this local MCP
- [29:24] server. So first things first, what
- [29:26] you'll notice inside this MCP server is
- [29:28] we're really just making two major types
- [29:29] of imports. First, we're importing
- [29:32] everything from agent development kit
- [29:33] needed to convert our tools over to
- [29:36] tools that can be used by our MCP
- [29:38] server. And then when it comes to MCP,
- [29:41] we're really just trying to, you know,
- [29:43] get everything ready to run an MCP
- [29:44] server. That's the main types of imports
- [29:46] that we have set up. Next, what I think
- [29:48] makes sense is we're going to dive in
- [29:50] and look at all the different tools that
- [29:52] we have access to and we're trying to
- [29:54] put in our MCP server. So, let's go from
- [29:57] top to bottom so you can understand
- [29:58] exactly what's going on. So first things
- [30:00] first, we have a utility function which
- [30:02] is called get database connection. This
- [30:04] is a utility function that's going to be
- [30:06] used by every single one of our tools.
- [30:08] So every single one of our list database
- [30:10] tables, git table, everything is going
- [30:13] to call this utility tool right here
- [30:14] that's actually going to connect to our
- [30:16] database. Once we've connected to a
- [30:17] database, we can start to have our tools
- [30:20] make changes and you know interact with
- [30:23] this database. So let's look at our list
- [30:25] database table. You can see what we're
- [30:27] trying to do is just hey what are all
- [30:28] the tables inside of the SQLite database
- [30:30] per usual following best practices
- [30:32] inside ADK you need to make sure that
- [30:35] you return a dictionary and then also
- [30:37] you need to make sure that you pass in
- [30:39] parameters quick note because this is a
- [30:41] bug that I've reported right now you
- [30:43] cannot make an MCP tool that has an
- [30:46] empty parameter so we just have to pass
- [30:48] in a dummy parameter to get this one to
- [30:50] work hopefully by the time you're
- [30:51] looking at this they make a quick fix
- [30:53] but just know if you try and create a
- [30:55] tool that doesn't have a parameter, it's
- [30:57] going to break. Or if you had done
- [30:59] something like this to where you passed
- [31:00] in a default value or you do something
- [31:03] that's like optional, it will break. So
- [31:06] you need to be very specific and make
- [31:07] sure that you follow best practices for
- [31:10] creating tools inside of ADK. And you
- [31:12] can check out their docs for more
- [31:13] information or the master class I've
- [31:15] created. So list the database tables.
- [31:17] All we're doing, we're connecting, we're
- [31:18] just running straight up SQL commands,
- [31:20] and then we're returning back everything
- [31:22] that we found with all the tables right
- [31:24] here for our agents. Next, what we're
- [31:26] trying to do is we should be able to for
- [31:28] any particular table, we want to be able
- [31:31] to get the schema. So, we want to be
- [31:33] able to see like, oh, this to-do table
- [31:35] has user ID, ID, task completed. That's
- [31:39] what type of schema we want to get. Then
- [31:40] when it comes to quering a database
- [31:42] table, we basically just want to for any
- [31:45] specific query, what we want to do is be
- [31:47] able to pass in, hey, I want to look at
- [31:49] this table. I want to look at this
- [31:51] column and under these conditions. So
- [31:53] yeah, basic SQL command stuff. So I'm
- [31:55] going to skip going through the rest of
- [31:56] those tools. And now we're going to dive
- [31:58] into the MCP server part. So what you
- [32:00] need to do first is you need to start to
- [32:02] create an instance of your MCP server.
- [32:04] So you just need to give your server a
- [32:06] name. So there's name, version, and
- [32:08] instructions. In our case, the only
- [32:09] thing you really need is a name. Now,
- [32:11] once we have our server set up, we need
- [32:13] to start saying, "Okay, server, you need
- [32:15] tools." That's the whole point of
- [32:16] setting up an MCP server is to
- [32:18] standardize giving tools to our agents.
- [32:20] So, what we have done is we've made a
- [32:22] nice dictionary of all the ADK database
- [32:25] tools we want to create. And what's nice
- [32:27] is ADK has created a function for us
- [32:30] that converts raw tools like our list
- [32:32] database table. It converts this
- [32:35] function with its parameters, its return
- [32:37] type, its dock strings. It converts it
- [32:39] into a tool that can be used by MCP
- [32:42] because by default ADK tools are of type
- [32:45] base tool, but MCP needs it in a
- [32:47] completely different format. So they've
- [32:48] made it a converter for us that you're
- [32:50] going to see in a section. But right
- [32:52] now, we're just saying, hey, I'm
- [32:53] creating a ADK tool called list database
- [32:57] table. And just in a second, you're
- [32:58] going to see how we can convert it over
- [32:59] to an MCP tool, which is where we're
- [33:01] starting to do right now, which is the
- [33:03] next part, which is like, okay, our
- [33:05] server, our MCP server, it needs to have
- [33:07] two different functions. So, if you
- [33:09] remember, every MCP server needs to be
- [33:10] able to list tools and call tools. So,
- [33:12] when it comes to listing tools, all
- [33:14] we're doing is we're going, hey, for
- [33:16] this list that you have right here of
- [33:18] all the database tools, what I want to
- [33:20] do is iterate through each one of them.
- [33:22] So for each tool that we have, I want to
- [33:25] iterate through them. And I want to call
- [33:27] the function that ADK has made for us
- [33:29] that converts from ADK tools to MCP
- [33:32] tools. And if you actually just dive in,
- [33:34] like I said earlier, ADK tools are of
- [33:37] this type, but MCP needs tools of this
- [33:39] type. So there's a nice little helper
- [33:41] function to make our life easier. And
- [33:42] this is just going to give us back our
- [33:44] schema. And all we're going to do is
- [33:45] just for every tool, we're just going to
- [33:46] keep adding to this list right here. And
- [33:48] once we're done iterating through all
- [33:50] the different tools and we have them in
- [33:51] the right format, we're just going to
- [33:52] return, hey, I have access to all of
- [33:55] these tools. And this is whenever you
- [33:57] call say, hey agent, you want to see
- [34:00] what all the different tools are on the
- [34:01] MCP server. It's actually just returning
- [34:03] this list right here. Then finally, the
- [34:05] next command that we're working with
- [34:07] that we want to add to our server is
- [34:08] call tool. So call tool, what it does is
- [34:11] it takes in a name of of a function that
- [34:13] we're trying to call and then specific
- [34:14] arguments. So like imagine we were
- [34:16] trying to call the get table schema.
- [34:19] Well for this tool what we need to do is
- [34:21] we just need to pass in a table name and
- [34:23] it we would expect to get back the table
- [34:26] name and all the columns for that table.
- [34:28] So that's all we're trying to do with
- [34:29] call tool. So you know we would just
- [34:31] pass in get table schema and then we
- [34:33] would just pass in the name of that
- [34:35] specific table. Then what we want to do
- [34:37] is we want to check to say okay well it
- [34:39] looks like you're trying to call this
- [34:40] tool. Do we actually have access to this
- [34:42] tool? Like does this tool exist? Oh
- [34:44] yeah, get table schema does exist. So we
- [34:46] can start to call it and then all we
- [34:48] have to do is just on that specific tool
- [34:51] just call run async and it's going to
- [34:52] generate a tool response. And then that
- [34:54] tool response all we're doing is
- [34:56] returning it back to our agent. So we're
- [34:59] just saying all right here's the return
- [35:01] type. It's text content and I'm just
- [35:03] returning the response back to the agent
- [35:06] to, you know, take action on it. And if
- [35:08] anything goes wrong, just go ahead and
- [35:09] log it as an exception. Finally, what we
- [35:11] want to do now that we've created our
- [35:13] server that has access to listing tool
- [35:16] calls and calling tools, now we just
- [35:18] need to actually like run the server
- [35:20] itself. Cuz if you remember at the end
- [35:21] of the day, an MCP server, it's nothing
- [35:23] more than a server that's running and
- [35:24] it's waiting for the agent to talk to it
- [35:26] so that it can call a tool and then send
- [35:28] back the response. So here's what we're
- [35:30] trying to do. So we have a run MCP.
- [35:32] STDIO stands for standard input output
- [35:35] server. And all it is is basically just
- [35:37] think of it as if you hover over here,
- [35:39] it's basically just the way our client
- [35:42] or our our agent is going to communicate
- [35:44] with the server is through standard
- [35:45] input output. So all it's doing is just
- [35:47] like sending actual text as outputs and
- [35:50] it's receiving raw text as well. So I
- [35:52] won't go too deep into it, but just at
- [35:53] the high level to understand is like
- [35:55] this server is running locally on our
- [35:57] computer. It has a readstream where it's
- [35:59] reading in information from our agent.
- [36:02] So our agent's passing in information
- [36:04] and readstream and then as we send data
- [36:06] out we're going out on the right stream.
- [36:08] So that's how we you know send
- [36:09] information back to our agent and then
- [36:11] all we're doing is saying okay I have my
- [36:13] MCP server studio. Now what I can do is
- [36:15] actually run this application and all I
- [36:18] want to do is just say all right I want
- [36:20] to run with this readstream write stream
- [36:22] and just to help the agent understand a
- [36:26] little bit more about this server. You
- [36:28] can actually say and initialize it to
- [36:29] say like oh I am this server I'm this
- [36:32] version and here's some of the extra
- [36:33] capabilities that I have. Once that's up
- [36:35] and running you are good to go. So
- [36:37] what's interesting about this is you can
- [36:39] actually just run the server even
- [36:40] without your agent. So let me just show
- [36:41] you what I mean. So if you change
- [36:43] directory to local MCP, you can go ahead
- [36:46] and run this server just by running
- [36:48] server.py and this will kick off the
- [36:50] local server right here. Now what's
- [36:52] going to happen though is you're not
- [36:53] going to really see anything happen
- [36:55] under the hood. But you will if you go
- [36:57] over to the logs because you can see at
- [36:59] the very top of the file, let me just go
- [37:01] back so you can see it. You can see at
- [37:02] the very top of the file, we are logging
- [37:03] everything at MCP server activity. So
- [37:05] when we kick off our server, you can
- [37:07] see, hey, it is running. I've created
- [37:09] the MCP server. It's initialized. I've
- [37:11] registered the two different types of
- [37:13] requests and now I'm just waiting. I'm
- [37:15] waiting for the agent to start sending
- [37:16] me requests. So, pretty cool. You have
- [37:18] your first MCP server up and running.
- [37:20] So, what we're going to do next is we're
- [37:21] going to hop over to the agent and start
- [37:22] running through how we can connect our
- [37:24] agent to this local MCP server. So,
- [37:26] let's hop over to the next part. So,
- [37:27] let's quickly cover how we can set up
- [37:29] our ADK agent on our computer to connect
- [37:32] to our local MCP server. It's actually
- [37:34] pretty straightforward, but there's a
- [37:36] few gotchas you got to be careful for.
- [37:37] So the most important thing that is
- [37:39] probably pretty common by this point is
- [37:41] you've seen how to create an agent.
- [37:43] You've seen all this before and you've
- [37:46] also seen in order to in the previous
- [37:48] section when we were connecting to
- [37:49] remote MCP servers. It's basically the
- [37:52] exact same thing except now we're just
- [37:54] changing up the command and arguments
- [37:56] that we're trying to run in order to
- [37:58] kick off the server. In this case the
- [38:00] server because it's running on our local
- [38:02] computer. What we have to do is say,
- [38:04] "All right, what I want to do is I want
- [38:06] to kick off the Python server I've
- [38:08] created." So, I'm going to I need to run
- [38:10] Python just like you would run any
- [38:11] normal piece of code. You would do like
- [38:13] Python main.py, Python server.py,
- [38:15] whatever you would normally do. We're
- [38:16] going to call Python 3. And then we need
- [38:18] to point to the pace on our computer
- [38:21] where our MCP is at. In our case, it's
- [38:23] in the exact same folder. So, we're in
- [38:25] agent.py and we're trying to call this
- [38:27] server.py. Well, in order to get your
- [38:29] local MCP servers to work, you have to
- [38:32] point at the absolute path to your
- [38:35] server.py. So, that's what we're doing
- [38:37] right here. We're trying to say, "Hey,
- [38:39] Python, I would like you to get my
- [38:41] current file path. I would like you to
- [38:43] get the parent, which is going to point
- [38:44] to local MCP, and then I want you to add
- [38:47] forward/server.py, which is then going
- [38:49] to point here. And this is what's going
- [38:50] to give us the total absolute path for
- [38:53] our server. And this is what's going to
- [38:55] allow us to actually run and connect to
- [38:57] our MCP server right here. And then
- [38:59] finally, just in case you want to see
- [39:00] the instructions, we're basically just
- [39:01] saying like, hey, you're an efficient
- [39:03] database agent. You can talk to
- [39:05] databases. Be smart about it is all
- [39:07] we're trying to say. And let me go ahead
- [39:08] and run it to you. And then I want to
- [39:09] show a few quick pieces of information
- [39:11] that you can do. So let's go ahead and
- [39:13] kick things off. And the first thing we
- [39:15] need to do is change directories to go
- [39:17] back to our root ADK MCP directory. And
- [39:19] then now we can start to run our agent.
- [39:21] So we can do ADK web. And this will spin
- [39:23] everything up. It might just take a
- [39:25] second. Yep, everything is running. So
- [39:27] now I can come back over here, refresh,
- [39:29] and you want to make sure you have local
- [39:30] MCP clicked. So now what I can do is
- [39:33] start to take this agent for a run with
- [39:35] all the new MCP tools that we have set
- [39:37] up. So we can say, what tools do you
- [39:40] have access to? And then what this
- [39:43] should do is it should make a request to
- [39:46] our MCP server and say, hey, get all the
- [39:49] different tools that I have access to.
- [39:50] And you can see it actually did it.
- [39:52] These are all the tools that we set up
- [39:54] back inside of our server.py. So you can
- [39:57] see all these different tools right
- [39:58] here. Insert data, delete data, they're
- [40:00] all right here. Pretty darn cool. So now
- [40:02] we can actually see if these tools are
- [40:04] working and we can actually call them.
- [40:05] So we can say what tables do I have
- [40:09] access to? And this should trigger the
- [40:11] list all tables and it should return
- [40:14] back the hey you have access to the
- [40:16] users and to-do list which if you dig
- [40:18] into our database you can see yeah
- [40:20] they're just to-dos and users. So it's
- [40:22] working pretty darn cool. But now let's
- [40:24] actually go deeper cuz I want to show
- [40:25] you that it can actually change the way
- [40:27] we're communicating in English to actual
- [40:29] tool calls. So let's say what users do I
- [40:34] have in the users table. And what this
- [40:36] should do is change up the command into
- [40:39] a query command instead. So you can see,
- [40:41] oh, I have Bob. And now what I want to
- [40:43] show you is like this can actually come
- [40:44] up with condition logic. So you can see
- [40:46] the query database table, it just like,
- [40:48] hey, for the users table, just give me
- [40:50] all the information. That's what it did.
- [40:52] But now we can be fancy with it and say,
- [40:54] what to-dos does Bob have? And then this
- [40:57] should create a new custom query where
- [40:59] it's like, hey, I want to look at the
- [41:01] to-do table where the user ID is equal
- [41:04] to the user ID from Bob. And that's
- [41:06] pretty darn cool because you can see Bob
- [41:08] has two projects or two tasks. He needs
- [41:10] to finish a project and he needs to go
- [41:11] for a run. And then we can add logic two
- [41:13] where we can say add a to-do for Bob. So
- [41:17] add a to-do for Bob to let's say go
- [41:20] grocery shopping. And what this should
- [41:22] do is call insert and insert data should
- [41:24] now do it again. And then we can
- [41:27] basically call it again. And we should
- [41:28] be able to see Bob now has three
- [41:30] different to-dos. And if we hop over to
- [41:33] our database and to-dos, you can see
- [41:35] there's a new one for buy groceries. So
- [41:37] yeah, all around it did pretty darn
- [41:39] cool. So this is, you know, this is
- [41:40] basically ADK plus MCP in a nutshell.
- [41:44] You also learned exactly how to create
- [41:46] your MCP server on your local computer.
- [41:48] You learned how to create tools that you
- [41:50] pass into your MCP server. I mean, you
- [41:53] guys are pros at this point. So let me
- [41:55] know if you have questions on anything
- [41:56] that we just covered, cuz like I said, I
- [41:57] know MCP's a little bit more advanced,
- [41:59] but I'm always happy to help. comment
