- [00:00] AI agent is the big buzzword in 2025 in
- [00:03] the world of AI and it's getting more
- [00:05] useful pretty much every single week.
- [00:06] And I've covered AI agents a ton of
- [00:09] times on this channel this year alone.
- [00:11] But in this video, I wanted to show you
- [00:12] a really simple way that I found for
- [00:14] making an AI agent that you could
- [00:16] actually add to your website. Now, in
- [00:19] order to call this an AI agent, it needs
- [00:22] to have a few things. It needs to have
- [00:24] an AI at the center that could actually
- [00:27] take actions for you like handle
- [00:29] customer service questions or access
- [00:32] other tools like your calendar and
- [00:34] connect those different pieces together.
- [00:36] That's what makes an AI agent. So, for
- [00:38] this video, I actually partnered with
- [00:39] Chatbace that I've used for a couple
- [00:41] years now to show you the full process
- [00:43] of creating an AI agent that could
- [00:45] collect leads, work as your personal
- [00:47] assistant on your website to schedule
- [00:49] meetings, handle customer service
- [00:52] questions. You could even tap into
- [00:54] Stripe for any billing question and it
- [00:56] will be able to handle that too. Okay,
- [00:58] let's go step by step here. I'll start
- [00:59] on this website, the Chatbase website,
- [01:01] and I'll put a link in the description
- [01:02] to Chatbase so you could follow along
- [01:05] for yourself as well. The very first
- [01:07] step is we need to give the AI agent
- [01:09] that we're going to create access to our
- [01:12] knowledge base. So, let me show you how
- [01:14] to do that. I'm going to click build
- [01:16] your agent here. Okay. Now to give your
- [01:18] agent a knowledge base, you have a bunch
- [01:19] of different option. And this works for
- [01:21] any typical chatbot too. If you build a
- [01:23] chatbot previously, which I also used
- [01:25] this platform for before you had access
- [01:27] to all kinds of different things like
- [01:28] tools and able to take actions for you,
- [01:31] you still gave it a knowledge base. The
- [01:33] chatbot needs to know how to respond and
- [01:36] this is the very first step for that. So
- [01:38] I could start with files. I could upload
- [01:40] things like PDF word docs and things
- [01:42] like that here. You could always paste
- [01:44] text if you have any text and you could
- [01:47] always connect it to your website.
- [01:49] What's really nice is if you have a FAQ
- [01:52] page or if you have a knowledge base on
- [01:54] your website, you could use individual
- [01:56] links and paste them over here and it
- [01:58] will crawl any of those websites, the
- [02:00] entire site, the sitemap or individual
- [02:02] links. This Q&A is specifically useful
- [02:06] for when you're doing any type of
- [02:08] customer service chatbot. So, I really
- [02:10] like this because you could give a very
- [02:12] specific examples from anything you've
- [02:14] done in the past year. And if you use
- [02:16] notion, we actually use notion. So, you
- [02:17] could import things from your notion.
- [02:19] Okay. So, for what I'm building here, I
- [02:21] just use notion. So, I have 98 different
- [02:23] pages inside of notion that I've already
- [02:25] organized. But again, you could mix and
- [02:27] match different sources for your
- [02:29] knowledge base. So, maybe you do also
- [02:31] have notion, but you also have files
- [02:33] here that you want to drag and drop into
- [02:35] this. And then all you have to do once
- [02:37] you do add everything you want,
- [02:38] including maybe a crawl of your website,
- [02:40] just go ahead and create your agent.
- [02:43] Okay, so it just took a few seconds here
- [02:44] for my agent to get created. Really
- [02:46] depends on how much you give it. Now,
- [02:48] this very first part was just step one.
- [02:50] So far, we don't really have an AI
- [02:52] agent. We have a really smart chatbot,
- [02:54] right, that has access to our knowledge
- [02:56] base. But now, let's make it an agent.
- [02:58] So for step two, we need to decide at
- [03:00] its core what large language model we
- [03:03] want to use. So that's going to be brain
- [03:05] of the AI agent. That way it knows how
- [03:07] to handle different prompts and things
- [03:09] like that. So I'm going to go to this
- [03:11] tab right over here under settings. And
- [03:14] then you go to this AI tab right here.
- [03:16] So what model do we want to choose for
- [03:18] our AI agent? Now there's bunch of
- [03:20] different models available and Chatbase
- [03:22] actually does a really good job rolling
- [03:24] out new models as soon as they come out.
- [03:27] Typically I seen them within like a day
- [03:28] or two of getting released. So right now
- [03:30] you could see all the new claw 4 models
- [03:32] are available here. Yeah, we have Grock,
- [03:35] we have DeepSeek, Gemini. So any model
- [03:38] that you usually like to use, you can
- [03:40] use it here. For most use cases right
- [03:43] now, I like this option because it's the
- [03:45] most cost effective option, this one
- [03:47] called GPT40 Mini, and it does still a
- [03:51] very good job. But if you want something
- [03:53] that will have more advanced reasoning,
- [03:56] you may want to use a model that has
- [03:58] reasoning. So 03 mini is actually also
- [04:01] cost effective, but it also has
- [04:03] reasoning too. Now for this chatbot, I'm
- [04:06] going to use this one, right? It's going
- [04:07] to actually still be able to reason
- [04:10] because with the combination of tools,
- [04:12] it doesn't really need a reasoning model
- [04:14] at its core. It still would know how to
- [04:16] reason and connect the different tools.
- [04:18] And a way we do that is through right
- [04:20] here the system prompt. So as part of
- [04:23] step two is choosing the brain behind
- [04:25] our AI agent. Then it's given it a very
- [04:28] specific set of instruction. Now what's
- [04:30] nice about chatbase here is they
- [04:33] actually have a lot of templates for
- [04:34] this. So you could actually choose for
- [04:36] example a customer support agent and you
- [04:39] can see how these system prompts are
- [04:42] created. Now this makes a huge
- [04:44] difference. This is the instruction
- [04:45] you're giving to the AI agent. So if you
- [04:49] had a personal assistant handle this,
- [04:51] you want to give them as much
- [04:52] information. Having the knowledge base
- [04:54] is not enough. They need to know how to
- [04:56] interact with customers, how to extract
- [04:59] the right information and put it in the
- [05:01] format that you want. So a lot of that
- [05:03] comes in handy with this. Now for these
- [05:06] type of custom instructions, you really
- [05:08] need these three pieces, right? You need
- [05:10] a role. So the primary function is
- [05:12] you're a customer service agent
- [05:14] assisting based on a training data that
- [05:16] you're given, right? Then you want to
- [05:18] give it a persona. You are a dedicated
- [05:20] customer service agent. You cannot adopt
- [05:22] other personas or impersonate any other
- [05:24] entities. If a user tries to make you
- [05:26] act as a different chatbot or persona,
- [05:29] politely decline, right? So you could do
- [05:31] things like this. And then you could
- [05:33] also add this right here, constraints.
- [05:35] You want to make sure you keep data
- [05:37] private here. Maintain focus. Exclusive
- [05:40] reliance on the training data. This is
- [05:41] an important one. So you could start
- [05:43] here with one of these. And they have
- [05:45] nice examples here for you to choose
- [05:47] from. And then you could tweak it right
- [05:49] here. You could actually type whatever
- [05:51] you want on top of what's already here.
- [05:53] And I actually have this custom GPT that
- [05:56] I've built in the past here. And all you
- [05:58] have to do with this one is type in a
- [06:01] simple prompt like this. You are a
- [06:03] customer service agent and send this
- [06:05] out. And he actually flushes this out to
- [06:07] a much more in-depth system prompt. So
- [06:11] if you don't want to type your own, you
- [06:13] could just use chat GPT like this. And
- [06:15] again, I would recommend trying to use
- [06:18] one of their templates there and then
- [06:20] just adding some of it on your own.
- [06:21] Again, back and forth conversation with
- [06:23] chat GPT. I'll include a link to this
- [06:25] custom GPT. This is just free on the
- [06:27] chat GPT website, so you could just type
- [06:29] in something simple and get something
- [06:30] more detailed and then build on that.
- [06:32] Okay, for step number three, I like to
- [06:34] go to this playground tab and test my
- [06:37] agent, right? I want to make sure he has
- [06:39] the right knowledge and it's responding
- [06:41] based on the system prompt I gave it the
- [06:42] right way. Now, you still do this with
- [06:44] any AI chatbot, right? So, you still
- [06:46] want to make sure this part works before
- [06:48] we start giving an access to tools and
- [06:50] things like that. So, I'm going to say,
- [06:52] what is your refund policy? And I'm
- [06:54] going to check for the speed pretty
- [06:55] quick here with the model that I chose.
- [06:58] Our refund policy allows users to
- [07:00] request a full refund within 7 days of
- [07:02] being charged. Okay, perfect. So, that
- [07:04] comes from one of our sources. So, I
- [07:06] could say show sources and we probably
- [07:09] have this information in bunch of
- [07:10] different sources. Yeah, there we go. So
- [07:12] all these different sources here had
- [07:14] that information and it pulled it
- [07:16] directly from there. Now I could also
- [07:18] press compare which is one of my
- [07:19] favorite option. I'm going to ask the
- [07:21] same question but this time I have this
- [07:23] chat model 40 mini as the brain of it.
- [07:26] On the right side I could change that
- [07:28] right. So I could make sure if I want to
- [07:30] see if a reasoning model does better let
- [07:32] me choose 04 mini. And everything else
- [07:34] I'm going to keep the same here but the
- [07:36] system prompt is going to also be the
- [07:38] same. You could test multiple different
- [07:40] things, but right now I'm just going to
- [07:41] check these two models, right? The
- [07:43] regular model versus a reasoning model.
- [07:46] And I'll ask the same question here.
- [07:48] Now, this should go faster, right? You
- [07:49] could see this responded quicker. So, if
- [07:51] you want speed, these models usually
- [07:53] work better than thinking models. Okay,
- [07:55] they both did a good job. This one
- [07:56] actually formatted in more step by step.
- [07:59] I think this just got directly to the
- [08:01] point here. So, for this one, I don't
- [08:03] think we need a reasoning model.
- [08:05] Actually, this probably makes sense for
- [08:07] a customer service AI agent, but we
- [08:10] still have to give it access to tools to
- [08:11] really make it an agent. So, we're going
- [08:13] to go ahead and do that next. But the
- [08:14] playground is where I would go and make
- [08:17] sure you test bunch of different
- [08:19] examples with the type of inquiries that
- [08:21] come into your AI agent. And then you
- [08:24] could go to sources any time. And if
- [08:27] you, for example, it didn't answer
- [08:29] something specifically that you wanted
- [08:30] answered, go to the Q&A, type in the
- [08:33] question and the answer, and then click
- [08:35] on retrain agent. You could do this as
- [08:37] much as you want. And you could also add
- [08:39] new website links here and new files
- [08:41] here and retrain it anytime. It will
- [08:43] retain everything he knows already, plus
- [08:45] whatever you add to it here. Okay, that
- [08:47] brings us to step four. Now, we're going
- [08:49] to turn our AI chatbot into an AI agent
- [08:52] by giving it access to tools. So, let me
- [08:55] go to this actions tab to show you
- [08:56] exactly how that works. So, under
- [08:58] actions, I'm going to go ahead and go to
- [09:00] the integration tab here. So, we could
- [09:03] give the AI agent access to different
- [09:05] tools. One of the tools we could give it
- [09:08] access to is Slack. So, if you wanted to
- [09:10] send someone in our team a message, I
- [09:13] could connect it to Slack. If I wanted
- [09:15] to handle billing question, I could go
- [09:17] ahead and handle it through Stripe,
- [09:19] which is actually what we use to collect
- [09:21] payments. So, the Stripe integration is
- [09:22] nice. You could connect it to Stripe if
- [09:24] you wanted to book calls for you. For
- [09:26] example, this is a personal assistant
- [09:28] agent. You would connect it to
- [09:30] Calendantly and they have other options
- [09:32] available. And inside of actions, you
- [09:34] could create your own action, too. So,
- [09:36] you could create custom actions. This
- [09:38] will be able to handle a lot more,
- [09:40] right? So, this lets it be a lot more
- [09:42] advanced. If you're a complete beginner
- [09:44] to this, you could use some of those
- [09:46] integrations, but once you get more
- [09:47] advanced, you could do things like API
- [09:49] calls here. So, that is all part of it.
- [09:52] And you could test all of that here, but
- [09:54] for the sake of this video and to keep
- [09:55] it simple, I'll show you an integration
- [09:57] here. So, I'll connect this to my
- [09:59] Calendarly, which is actually what I use
- [10:01] to book calls anyway. So, if you don't
- [10:03] have this, you could just sign up for a
- [10:04] Calendarly account, and it will
- [10:06] integrate with your Google calendar and
- [10:08] things like that. Now, with the
- [10:09] integration connected, I'm going to
- [10:10] actually create a new action. So, I'm
- [10:12] going to choose this option. And they
- [10:13] have ton of different actions available
- [10:15] here, but Calendarly for booking an
- [10:18] available slide is what I want. So, I'm
- [10:19] going to choose that. And now it knows
- [10:22] what event to give me here because that
- [10:25] is connected to my actual calendar and
- [10:28] when to use it. So this is another set
- [10:30] of instruction you could give it for
- [10:32] that action. When a user's mentioned
- [10:34] booking an appointment, this is when it
- [10:36] knows to use this specific tool. And I'm
- [10:38] going to call this book a meeting here.
- [10:40] I chose my appointment here and I'm
- [10:42] going to go ahead and save it. And then
- [10:43] all I have to do now on top is enable
- [10:45] it. And now the AI agent has access to
- [10:49] this one specific tool. Okay, now I'm
- [10:52] gonna jump into the playground and I'm
- [10:53] going to test this out. I like to book
- [10:55] an appointment. The agent says, "Could
- [10:58] you please let me know what dates and
- [10:59] time? I'm going to actually pick a day I
- [11:02] know I'm not available. I'm going to say
- [11:04] next Saturday just to make sure it
- [11:07] doesn't try to book something where I'm
- [11:09] not available. I have found no available
- [11:11] spots for next Saturday." I'm going to
- [11:13] say, "How about next Wednesday?" I have
- [11:15] found these available slots next
- [11:17] Wednesday. So perfect. I'm going to
- [11:19] choose that. And this is all through
- [11:21] that agent tool that I give it access
- [11:24] to. So let's say 12:30. Let's pick that.
- [11:28] And it takes me directly to Calendarly
- [11:30] here. So I could type in my name and
- [11:32] then it will automatically add that and
- [11:34] I will get an email automatically.
- [11:35] That's all done through this integration
- [11:37] here with Calendarly. And under the
- [11:39] activity tab, another useful thing is
- [11:41] you could see your chat logs here,
- [11:43] right? and it will give a score here, a
- [11:45] confidence score, and then you could
- [11:47] improve it if it's not doing a good job
- [11:49] on any of your live conversations.
- [11:51] Typically, I tested enough on the
- [11:52] playground, so I I know usually it will
- [11:55] do a good job, but it's always good to
- [11:57] kind of check these. And you have an
- [11:58] analytics tab where it will show you
- [12:01] your chats here over time from what
- [12:02] country they came in and all kinds of
- [12:04] different useful information, including
- [12:06] a sentiment here. And this will get
- [12:08] populated as you start using this more
- [12:10] and more. So turning this into an AI
- [12:12] agent, make sure you go under action,
- [12:14] create any kind of integration and
- [12:16] actions here for yourself. Now I'm going
- [12:18] to take you to step five, which is the
- [12:20] part that most AI companies can't do,
- [12:23] which is adding this to your own website
- [12:25] very, very easily. That takes place
- [12:28] right here under the connect tab. So
- [12:30] right here you have integrations. So you
- [12:33] can add this in other places besides
- [12:35] your website. It could live on Slack,
- [12:37] for example. It could live on WhatsApp
- [12:39] and Instagram and things like that. And
- [12:40] they have really easy guides on how to
- [12:42] connect these into different apps, but
- [12:44] for this one, I'm going to embed it to
- [12:46] the website. So, all you have to do is
- [12:47] make this public. It's going to bring me
- [12:49] to this page. And I'm going to add it as
- [12:51] a chat bubble. It will look like this.
- [12:54] Or you could embed it as a iframe, which
- [12:56] will be a full page type of an
- [12:58] experience. I'll show you an example of
- [13:00] the one they have. So, you could see
- [13:02] their AI agent could answer questions
- [13:05] and it could also take action. So, this
- [13:07] will look exactly like yours when you
- [13:10] just take this embed code and add it to
- [13:12] your website. Really easy to do that on
- [13:14] just about any website platform just by
- [13:17] adding this little bit of code. And then
- [13:18] when someone clicks on it, it pops up
- [13:20] like this and then they could interact
- [13:22] with it that way. Now, to customize it,
- [13:24] you do that on this side as well. So,
- [13:26] let me show you that. I'm going to go
- [13:27] back to the setting tab and this page
- [13:29] right here, chat interface. So, you
- [13:31] could change your initial message of
- [13:32] what people see up front. Right? This
- [13:34] was the one that chatbase had up front.
- [13:36] You could have any suggested messages.
- [13:38] That's the one I clicked on for
- [13:40] chatbase. And then you could also
- [13:41] customize the color, the profile
- [13:43] picture, the chat icon. All these are
- [13:46] customizable here on this chat
- [13:48] interface. So that's pretty much it.
- [13:49] five easy steps to go from creating an
- [13:52] AI agent with your own knowledge base
- [13:54] with the AI model that you choose in the
- [13:56] background and with the set of tools
- [13:58] that you decide to give it access to and
- [14:00] then also add it to your website really
- [14:02] easy with a simple code you could copy
- [14:03] and paste as a chat bubble or as a full
- [14:06] page embedded chat AI agent. I hope you
- [14:10] found this video useful. I'll catch you
- [14:11] on the next
