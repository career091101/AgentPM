- [00:02] This is a practical session under the
- [00:05] direct supervision of the Ministry of
- [00:07] Marine and Blue Economy and the National
- [00:10] Inland Waterways Authority. Boats
- [00:13] drivers and skippers are being put
- [00:15] through their paces.
- [00:20] The primary objective is to sharpen the
- [00:22] technical expertise of operators and
- [00:25] enforce a culture of safety by mastering
- [00:28] navigation techniques. These maritime
- [00:31] stakeholders aim to significantly reduce
- [00:34] the frequency of boat mishaps that have
- [00:36] recently plagued the nation's coastal
- [00:38] and inland waters. Yeah, I will rate
- [00:41] this training um
- [00:44] let me say 90% successful because we did
- [00:47] not only train in class we to them on
- [00:50] practical. So today being the last day
- [00:53] we were we were at the jetty for the
- [00:55] practical session and it was awesome.
- [00:58] >> The training has drawn participants from
- [01:00] across the federation. For many, this is
- [01:03] a long awaited opportunity to formalize
- [01:06] their skills and align with
- [01:08] international maritime standards.
- [01:11] We have learned so much, especially
- [01:15] how to handle
- [01:17] boats, the safety aspect of it, how to
- [01:21] apply first aid, medical approach in
- [01:24] terms of any emergency. with this uh
- [01:28] training now we can be able to when
- [01:30] there's distress we can be able to
- [01:32] overcome it because due to the knowledge
- [01:34] and the opportunity be given to the boat
- [01:37] operator
- [01:38] >> so I give kudos to the federal
- [01:42] government and na and the blue economy
- [01:46] of Nigeria
- [01:47] >> na officials emphasize that this program
- [01:50] is not just a routine exercise but a
- [01:53] direct response to the evolving
- [01:55] challenges of modern water transport. It
- [01:58] forms a cornerstone of their brother
- [02:01] strategy to ensure every voyage on
- [02:03] Nigerian waters is a safe one.
- [02:06] >> Go to a lot of places in Lagos inland
- [02:10] waterway today, presently now, you will
- [02:13] discover that the channel is very free
- [02:17] to navigate for any boat operators. You
- [02:21] understand? Wreck removal is there. The
- [02:24] urgency of this training cannot be
- [02:26] overstated.
- [02:28] A recent wave of avoidable tragedies has
- [02:31] highlighted a desperate need for reform.
- [02:35] Authorities believe that if these
- [02:37] standard practices are strictly upheld,
- [02:40] the era of frequent water transport
- [02:42] disasters may finally be coming to an
- [02:45] end.
