- [00:02] [music]
- [00:05] Hi everyone and welcome to the agent
- [00:07] factory the podcast that goes beyond the
- [00:09] hype and dives into building production
- [00:11] ready AI agents. I'm Smitha Cullen
- [00:14] >> and I'm Vlad Kalisnikov
- [00:16] >> and today we're joined by Brandon
- [00:18] Hancock who is a full stack engineer and
- [00:21] who is also known on YouTube as AI with
- [00:24] Brandon where he teaches AI to over
- [00:26] 80,000 developers. Welcome to the show
- [00:28] Brandon. Hey Smith. Hey Vlad. So excited
- [00:30] to be here today. Awesome world of
- [00:33] everything that's going on right now
- [00:34] with AI and I'm so excited to dive into
- [00:36] it with you guys today.
- [00:37] >> Yes. Uh it is a very special day. We are
- [00:40] recording just a few hours uh after
- [00:43] Google released two new products. birth
- [00:45] our new flagship model Gemini 3 where we
- [00:49] had a lot of anticipation for that and a
- [00:52] surprise anti-gravity um our agentic
- [00:56] coding environment with lots of features
- [00:59] uh to explore and um in just in general
- [01:03] it's very exciting and um we will show
- [01:06] you a few demos um of Gemini 3 obviously
- [01:10] uh Brandon has a very special demo
- [01:12] himself uh with Gemini CLI
- [01:15] And I've got some surprises, too.
- [01:17] >> Awesome. So, let's kick it off with
- [01:19] Gemini 3 Pro. Uh, I've gotten the chance
- [01:23] to play with it already, and I've been
- [01:24] super impressed. It's really great at
- [01:27] advanced highle reasoning, and also,
- [01:30] it's able to uh complete complex tasks
- [01:33] really well. Also, it is able to do
- [01:36] stuff like agentic operations really
- [01:38] well. So, it makes it really the ideal
- [01:40] model to build AI agents with. and I
- [01:43] spent a ton of time already trying to
- [01:45] build AI agents with Gemini 3 Pro and
- [01:47] I've been blown away. Uh, one thing I've
- [01:49] really liked using it in is actually AI
- [01:52] Studio. So, let me actually hop into AI
- [01:55] Studio and showcase what I've been
- [01:56] doing. Okay, so I'm in Google AI Studio
- [01:59] and what I've been thinking recently is
- [02:02] about building a personal website. I
- [02:04] know I'm I'm a dev at Google and I
- [02:06] should probably have one, but I don't.
- [02:08] Uh so what I've done is actually I took
- [02:12] my LinkedIn page and I exported it as a
- [02:14] PDF. I also used Nano Banana to create
- [02:19] an inspiration picture of what I want my
- [02:22] website to look like. And then I'm
- [02:24] uploading all of that into build in uh
- [02:28] Google AI Studio to help build out that
- [02:30] website. So let me start off by
- [02:32] uploading the PDF of my profile from
- [02:34] LinkedIn.
- [02:37] And then I'm also going to be uploading
- [02:39] a profile image of me so it gets that
- [02:42] right. And um I'm also going to be
- [02:45] uploading that inspiration picture of
- [02:47] how that website should be looking like.
- [02:49] Okay. Uh help me create a personal
- [02:51] portfolio website based on the profile.
- [02:55] PDF file which contains my LinkedIn
- [02:57] profile and then use the inspo.png as
- [03:01] inspiration for how the website should
- [03:02] look like. And then make sure that you
- [03:04] include that profile picture of me as
- [03:06] well.
- [03:08] I'm pumped to see how this turns out. I
- [03:10] would love to see some of the like
- [03:11] initial pictures you did with uh Nano
- [03:13] Banana because seriously one of the
- [03:16] coolest AI image generators I've seen. I
- [03:18] would love to see what you did for
- [03:19] inspiration cuz um would love to see how
- [03:22] AI takes that input and does something
- [03:23] with it. First, I used uh Gemini to give
- [03:26] me a prompt to give to Nano Banana based
- [03:29] on, you know, what I would like. And
- [03:31] using that prompt, Nanobanana came up
- [03:33] with this really nice inspo pick which
- [03:35] is pretty close to the website I'm
- [03:37] looking for.
- [03:38] >> That's awesome.
- [03:39] >> Look at the speed that it's working at.
- [03:41] Um I one thing I noticed with Gemini 3,
- [03:44] it's how fast it is.
- [03:47] Um, yeah, that that really makes a
- [03:49] difference for me as someone who likes
- [03:52] to iterate over and over on the same
- [03:54] thing. Um, and yeah, I've noticed that
- [03:57] it works really fast despite the fact
- [03:59] that so many people are now on it and
- [04:01] testing and trying and uh, you know,
- [04:04] offloading like huge data pieces on it
- [04:08] and just seeing how it performs. Our
- [04:10] TPUs are must be on fire, right?
- [04:13] [laughter]
- [04:14] And speaking of being on fire, I really
- [04:17] love all of these fire suggestions that
- [04:19] AI Studio gives. So, kind of like, oh,
- [04:22] if you want to add video understanding,
- [04:23] I can easily try to click this and then
- [04:26] add it here so that it becomes the next
- [04:27] prompt that I want to add to my website
- [04:29] if I if I wanted to.
- [04:32] >> Less than 3 minutes in. Oh my god.
- [04:35] >> Looks pretty cool.
- [04:38] >> The image is no longer available.
- [04:40] >> Okay.
- [04:41] >> See, it's AI. You always need to uh look
- [04:44] what it's done.
- [04:47] >> I mean, it it got all the details,
- [04:49] right?
- [04:50] >> I love it. I love it. Look, it really
- [04:53] got like I've been to your LinkedIn
- [04:55] page, so I know what's there.
- [04:57] >> Uh it really put your work experience
- [05:01] and email and yeah, you were a great
- [05:04] public speaker, de machine learning,
- [05:06] everything.
- [05:08] >> Yeah. Uh okay, let me actually try to
- [05:10] fix that image. Right. What I really
- [05:12] like is this annotation feature in uh
- [05:15] Google AI Studio. So, I'm going to click
- [05:17] this
- [05:18] >> and it allows you to annotate stuff that
- [05:20] like is missing. So, for example, just
- [05:22] this section and I can say um add that
- [05:28] section to chat and
- [05:34] fix my image with the actual profile
- [05:36] picture. So, while that's going real
- [05:38] fast, Smith though, one of the coolest
- [05:39] things that I've really liked about AI
- [05:41] Studio recently is its ability to like
- [05:43] single shot. I've tried to like test it
- [05:46] as much as I can on like everything from
- [05:48] like web applications all the way to
- [05:50] like like senior year of college like
- [05:53] level math and computer science and
- [05:55] electrical engineering. So, I like
- [05:56] tested it like on the full gambit and it
- [05:59] has crushed it on all levels like all
- [06:01] the way from regular software to like
- [06:03] full-blown like calculus 3 level math.
- [06:05] Like I know they say like smartest model
- [06:07] ever. So I was like I'm going to try and
- [06:09] test it out and it is. It really is. Um
- [06:13] yeah absolutely been amazed. I love this
- [06:16] image and and see how it also like
- [06:18] originally it wanted to style it with
- [06:20] the kind of black and white. Um yeah
- [06:23] because that's what your initial style
- [06:25] was and it it kept that that thing. I I
- [06:29] love it.
- [06:30] >> Yeah. And then also the fact that I
- [06:32] could have I gave that prompt very
- [06:35] specifically to just this section and it
- [06:37] didn't change the entire website because
- [06:39] that can happen too.
- [06:42] And that's my demo and this is my
- [06:44] website now.
- [06:48] >> Have you got to try publishing it yet
- [06:49] out of curiosity in the top right?
- [06:51] >> Oh yeah. So the cool thing is that I can
- [06:54] deploy this super easily to Cloud Run.
- [06:57] It's it's super easy.
- [07:00] >> Yeah. It just it just goes straight
- [07:02] there. Uh takes a few minutes and you
- [07:05] have your uh website up and running. You
- [07:08] literally don't need any knowledge about
- [07:11] Google Cloud or Cloud Run. Uh you click
- [07:14] one button. Sorry, that's just one of
- [07:16] the craziest parts that every time I
- [07:17] keep working with more and more of like
- [07:19] these uh tools from Google, it's like
- [07:21] the barrier to entry to just build and
- [07:23] ship stuff is insane. So, like in a lot
- [07:25] of my communities, there's people that
- [07:27] are like, "I've never coded an app
- [07:29] before, but I have an idea." And then
- [07:30] they'll just hop into, you know, any of
- [07:32] these tools and actually create
- [07:33] something. Like, it's crazy how many
- [07:35] more people are now able to build real
- [07:37] world apps uh thanks to these tools.
- [07:39] Like, it's it's always so exciting to
- [07:41] see people light it up for the first
- [07:42] time making their own apps.
- [07:43] >> And hey, Smith has got a website now.
- [07:45] You can hit contact me and uh [laughter]
- [07:48] and she'll fix it.
- [07:49] >> Okay, Brandon, you have something really
- [07:52] cool to showcase on Gemini CLI for us.
- [07:54] All right. So, here's what I wanted to
- [07:56] show you guys that I've been working on
- [07:57] using a combination of Gemini, Gemini,
- [08:00] uh, CLI, and I'm actually going to show
- [08:02] it a little bit in anti-gravity because
- [08:04] I'm pumped to show everything allin-one.
- [08:06] So, quick background, guys. So, what I'm
- [08:09] trying to do now in the age of AI is I
- [08:11] want to be AI first for everything I do.
- [08:14] I swear there's never enough hours in
- [08:15] the day. So, what I'm always looking to
- [08:17] do is to build out what I'm calling like
- [08:19] AI employees to help out with task in
- [08:23] every part of, you know, my YouTube
- [08:24] business, other businesses. I want AI to
- [08:27] do as much as it can so I have more time
- [08:29] to focus on the big things. So, what I
- [08:31] really want to show in this video with
- [08:33] you guys today is how I go about
- [08:36] building a market research AI employees.
- [08:39] And uh just super quick background just
- [08:41] so that we're on the same page. We have
- [08:42] a um me and a co-founder have a startup
- [08:44] where we're helping out emergency
- [08:46] medical services like ambulance
- [08:47] companies, fire departments. We're
- [08:49] basically helping them out with their
- [08:50] SOAP reports. So we have a phenomenal
- [08:52] idea of exactly who our customer avatar
- [08:55] is, but they're all across America. So
- [08:57] it's very hard to like, you know, I
- [08:59] could manually spend the rest of the
- [09:01] week on Google finding everyone in my
- [09:03] state. But we have amazing AI tools that
- [09:06] are using Google search. So I could
- [09:08] easily at scale kind of search the whole
- [09:11] market. So um this is what I wanted to
- [09:13] break down for you guys today. Basically
- [09:15] I'm pumped to showcase how we can
- [09:16] actually use Gemini CLI which is one of
- [09:19] the best CLI tools with you know having
- [09:21] the ability to do Google search and
- [09:23] thanks to you know the wide array uh
- [09:26] wide variety of models. We have
- [09:27] everything from you know Gemini 3 Pro
- [09:29] when we really want to think about it
- [09:31] all the way to Gemini 2.5 flash when we
- [09:33] want to kind of do things at scale. and
- [09:35] Gemini CLI they have like a super
- [09:37] generous free tier. I think it's like a
- [09:38] thousand requests per day completely for
- [09:40] free. So that's a like hey gotta love
- [09:43] free. Um so yeah so uh long story short
- [09:46] absolutely using Gemini CLI to build out
- [09:49] all of my AI employees. And one of the
- [09:52] things that I want to walk you guys
- [09:53] through is how you actually can do this.
- [09:55] Like how how on earth do you build an AI
- [09:58] employee? And it's basically just done
- [10:00] through markdown files. So, um, so
- [10:02] that's what I want to walk you through.
- [10:03] And just a quick challenge for the
- [10:04] audience after you guys kind of get to
- [10:06] see all this in action. I would love to
- [10:07] challenge you guys, too, to try to build
- [10:09] out each week like a new AI employee
- [10:11] because as time goes on by the end of
- [10:12] the year, like you're going to have a
- [10:14] full-blown workforce of Gemini models
- [10:17] running around doing all the work for
- [10:18] you guys.
- [10:19] >> That's awesome.
- [10:20] >> All right, perfect. And real quick, high
- [10:22] level, how do we think about building AI
- [10:24] employees with Gemini CLI? The way I
- [10:27] like to think about it is we have the
- [10:30] ability to use multiple models. So
- [10:32] here's what we want to do. Just like as
- [10:34] Vlad pointed out, we want to kind of
- [10:36] build out standard operating procedures,
- [10:38] which are instructions, which is awesome
- [10:40] because we get to use tools like Gemini
- [10:42] 3 Pro, which are these, you know,
- [10:44] insanely smart models to help write out
- [10:47] well doumented instructions such as
- [10:49] like, hey, please go search the
- [10:51] internet. Here's the type of questions
- [10:52] we want to look up. Here's the ultimate
- [10:54] goal that we're trying to uh achieve.
- [10:56] And these models are phenomenal at
- [10:57] writing very um specific and clear
- [11:00] instructions. Then when it comes time to
- [11:02] do not, you know, not the highle
- [11:04] thinking, but to actually go into like
- [11:06] what I call like workerb mode, hey,
- [11:08] fantastic. We can fall back on some of
- [11:10] the more fast, efficient, and more
- [11:12] affordable models like Gemini 2.5 flash
- [11:15] to actually go off and follow these
- [11:17] instructions. And the coolest part about
- [11:19] Gemini CLI is you can actually spin up
- [11:22] like you could really spin up a hundred
- [11:24] different agents in parallel to search
- [11:26] across all America. Like this is you
- [11:28] really have agents at scale. So the core
- [11:30] principle of building out AI employees
- [11:32] comes down to what these documents
- [11:34] include. These are standard operating
- [11:36] procedures where basically we once go we
- [11:40] once go through the process and clearly
- [11:41] define what our inputs are, what task we
- [11:44] want to accomplish and then at the very
- [11:46] end we describe the actual output that
- [11:48] we're trying to do. We can use Gemini to
- [11:52] go forth and follow these instructions.
- [11:54] So what I can say is um I can say please
- [11:59] follow the research uh let's actually do
- [12:03] this the research city instructions for
- [12:07] and then you can actually like in my
- [12:08] case I have multiple cities that I want
- [12:10] to go look up. So I can go through this
- [12:13] process and just like grab a few cities
- [12:15] and I can say for these
- [12:18] uh cities and then what's really nice is
- [12:21] I can actually pass in the cities and
- [12:23] then finally after that what we want to
- [12:25] do to like maximize our agent
- [12:27] capabilities is to actually run some
- [12:30] Python scripts to actually kick off
- [12:32] Gemini in parallel because that's one of
- [12:33] the coolest parts that I don't know if a
- [12:35] lot of people know about Gemini is you
- [12:37] can actually kick off Gemini in the
- [12:38] normal editor or you can do something
- [12:40] like this where you can pass in a prompt
- [12:43] which is a cheat code because you can
- [12:45] basically kick off hundreds of agents in
- [12:47] the background using this strategy. So
- [12:49] in this case we have some nice little um
- [12:52] some nice little Python scripts that
- [12:54] will go through the process of kicking
- [12:56] off Gemini in parallel to actually go
- [12:59] off and research everything that I need.
- [13:01] So we're just going to say use uh we'll
- [13:03] sorry about this. We'll say use at
- [13:05] process cities. And you know, at this
- [13:08] point, what it's going to do is we're
- [13:10] now kind of kicking things off to where
- [13:12] it's going to go through the process of
- [13:14] kicking off multiple parallel agents to
- [13:16] go off and search in each one of these
- [13:19] different cities in Miami to find
- [13:21] potential customers that we could reach
- [13:22] out and help with our company. Now, at
- [13:25] this point, what's nice is we're
- [13:27] actually having AI call a script. So the
- [13:30] AI is going to understand the parameters
- [13:32] of the script, pass in all the cities
- [13:33] and kick off the workflow. So I know
- [13:36] this kind of probably got a little deep
- [13:37] in the weeds. Is there any questions? I
- [13:39] want to take it high level too just
- [13:40] because I want people to understand um
- [13:43] you know that you could pretty much
- [13:45] build have agents do anything. That's
- [13:47] the cool part.
- [13:48] >> The scripts that you're talking about,
- [13:50] is that something you hardcoded or
- [13:52] Gemini CLI did that for you?
- [13:54] >> Great question. I don't code anymore,
- [13:57] which is the funniest statement as a
- [13:58] software engineer. I never code. I
- [14:00] review I review a lot of code but um all
- [14:03] I have to do is say hey Gemini CLI what
- [14:06] I'm trying to do is I want the ability
- [14:08] to give you and in this case I want to
- [14:10] give you three or four cities to go off
- [14:13] and research and what I want you to do
- [14:15] is run you know Gemini-P as a prompt and
- [14:19] basically just paste in this type of uh
- [14:22] city right here or these type of
- [14:23] instructions which is hey go research a
- [14:26] city do it for this city uh and
- [14:28] basically just kick this off 10 times or
- [14:29] 10 20 times, however many cities I give
- [14:31] you. So, no, that's all done based on uh
- [14:34] Gemini of what I need that question,
- [14:36] too.
- [14:37] >> No, not a question, more like a comment.
- [14:39] Uh last time I've been at the podcast,
- [14:41] this very podcast, I also used this uh
- [14:45] what I think is a cheat code of creating
- [14:49] uh you know little Python tool and
- [14:52] passing it to Gemini. And first like as
- [14:55] a as a software engineer even though you
- [14:57] don't write it uh you you have this
- [14:59] ability to kind of prompt it properly
- [15:02] and guide it to create uh those scripts
- [15:05] and verify whether it's right or not. Uh
- [15:08] but the thing I love the most is that
- [15:09] you don't have to explain how to use it.
- [15:12] >> You just give code and Gemini says like
- [15:15] okay I look at it this I think how how
- [15:17] to use it and 99.9% that's right about
- [15:19] it. I love and even even if sometimes it
- [15:22] uh runs it in the wrong way and the tool
- [15:25] crashes, it looks at the error and then
- [15:27] that next time it's right.
- [15:29] >> No, totally cheat code. Use it all the
- [15:32] time. Yeah.
- [15:32] >> Yeah. I agree. The one other just quick
- [15:34] side topic while this is a spinning off
- [15:37] when it comes to the concept of building
- [15:39] out AI employees, one thing I do want to
- [15:41] mention is we basically get to use AI to
- [15:44] do everything if it has context of the
- [15:46] problem. So, for example, um I also just
- [15:50] other other things, I use Gemini CLI as
- [15:53] a ghostriter to help me respond to
- [15:54] emails. So, you can easily hook up an
- [15:56] MCP server to Gmail and fantastic. I can
- [15:59] just pass in information such as like,
- [16:01] hey, here's Brandon's ghostriter. He it
- [16:04] knows how to write like me. Can you
- [16:05] please go pull down my emails and
- [16:07] respond to the latest three emails?
- [16:09] Because it knows who I am. It knows how
- [16:10] I like to write and it can just kick it
- [16:12] off. Outside of that, I have to write
- [16:14] monthly status reports. Well, my agents
- [16:16] has to write monthly stat supports. So,
- [16:17] um, key thing is just the more folders
- [16:19] you can add into your AI employee
- [16:21] directory, you just record the task and
- [16:24] then have AI do it the next time. And I
- [16:25] I do this for if I'm ever doing
- [16:27] something more than once, uh, I can
- [16:29] guarantee you AI is doing it for me. So,
- [16:31] um,
- [16:32] >> wait, so so was it your ghostriter
- [16:33] responding to all of my emails?
- [16:36] [laughter]
- [16:36] >> I No, no,
- [16:40] that's funny. There is human in the
- [16:42] loop. I do I do review it before
- [16:44] everything goes out. But um I mean this
- [16:45] is the coolest part guys like um we can
- [16:47] now use AI to move faster. Um eventually
- [16:50] it's going to be my agent talking to
- [16:52] your agent and it's just calendar events
- [16:53] are going to appear up on on so hey we
- [16:56] meet tomorrow kind of thing.
- [16:57] >> This is unreal. Yeah.
- [16:59] >> So while this is going I just want to
- [17:00] show real fast kind of what's uh
- [17:02] happening just so we can uh can move on.
- [17:04] But at the end of the day what we're
- [17:05] doing is just customer research. So for
- [17:07] each one of these cities you can see
- [17:09] it's starting to like save outputs. I
- [17:11] won't click on it because it's actually
- [17:12] going to show like customer data, but it
- [17:14] does a super deep dive into
- [17:16] understanding exactly what's happening
- [17:18] in that local city and then kind of just
- [17:21] taking the same principles. We uh what
- [17:24] we get to do next is once again use
- [17:25] standard operating procedures to take in
- [17:28] all the information from these different
- [17:29] cities. We aggregate it uh sorry I don't
- [17:32] know why it's showing but we aggregate
- [17:33] it into a database and then after that
- [17:36] we have an outreach SOP that shows
- [17:38] exactly how to write personal outreach
- [17:40] to each one of our customers to see if
- [17:41] they would be interested in working with
- [17:43] us. So this is kind of the workflow to
- [17:45] where you basically just have the AI
- [17:47] document the process and then repeat it
- [17:49] at scale going forward. So yeah um
- [17:52] seriously thank you guys for uh for
- [17:54] making uh making Jim and I work and all
- [17:56] the new models. Absolutely having a
- [17:58] field day with them. Automate everything
- [18:00] with Gemini. Huh?
- [18:01] >> That's the goal. [laughter]
- [18:04] >> Okay. So, just to recap, we saw Gemini
- [18:07] in AI Studio. We saw it in Gemini CLI,
- [18:10] which is a great agent, by the way. But
- [18:13] do you have another agent you want to
- [18:14] showcase with us?
- [18:16] >> Yes. Uh I will show you an ADK agent.
- [18:20] So, an agent built with uh Google's uh
- [18:23] agent development kit. And this agent is
- [18:26] made with uh vio 3.1 obviously with
- [18:30] Gemini and like I said uh with ADK. So
- [18:33] what's special about this agent is it's
- [18:35] specifically made to uh create
- [18:38] educational videos and it it doesn't
- [18:42] just uh take like a script and uh um
- [18:46] creates a video with a talking head that
- [18:49] tells you what's written in in in the
- [18:52] docu documentation script. It takes uh a
- [18:55] documentation page that uh you know if
- [18:58] you think about uh documentation for
- [19:01] developers it's full of code it's full
- [19:04] of uh bullet points uh you know numbered
- [19:06] list etc. And it creates um somewhat
- [19:10] engaging uh video where in this case uh
- [19:14] my favorite one of my favorite animals
- [19:16] uh Capibara uh is telling you the story.
- [19:20] So um the agent itself actually consists
- [19:23] of multiple sub aents right uh like we
- [19:26] love it about ADK it gets this uh this
- [19:29] boss orchestrator of the wood agent that
- [19:34] uh works with two sub agents one is the
- [19:36] script sequencer the script sequencer
- [19:39] does two important jobs first it adapts
- [19:42] the script so um when you know when we
- [19:45] start with the documentation page we
- [19:47] want it we want the text and that that
- [19:50] story to sound natural and engaging. So
- [19:52] does the adaptation or uh the scabby bar
- [19:56] of our character to sound natural and to
- [19:59] not read you bullet points like you know
- [20:01] like many speakers do of uh
- [20:04] presentations. Um second thing it does
- [20:07] it makes sure that uh those sentences
- [20:10] they're split in 8 second pieces and
- [20:13] it's very important because you know you
- [20:15] know uh video models they don't produce
- [20:17] very long videos uh they produce um
- [20:20] short uh pieces and we want again those
- [20:23] to sound natural and have nice
- [20:25] transitions and that's uh that's the
- [20:27] second job that script sequencer had.
- [20:29] Once that is done um it passes those um
- [20:34] sequences those chunks uh back to the
- [20:36] orchestrator and the orchestrator calls
- [20:38] video agent to generate videos. One
- [20:40] important thing and you probably saw it
- [20:43] when I was scrolling is that uh for for
- [20:46] the video generation I use nanobanana to
- [20:51] uh generate multiple views of my
- [20:53] character. Right? I've got four views
- [20:56] and I ask the orchestrator to uh
- [21:00] randomly choose a view for every uh
- [21:03] video that it creates. And when I pass a
- [21:06] script, it along with the chunking uh it
- [21:10] assigns um a view number to every chunk.
- [21:13] So the video is not just like a
- [21:15] monotonic talking head in the same kind
- [21:17] of think about this number one uh
- [21:20] position uh but it it goes randomly
- [21:23] between views that the video stays
- [21:25] engaging. Even if you use it like as a
- [21:27] small window uh in a larger presentation
- [21:30] uh you want some changes for that and
- [21:32] that actually makes a big difference.
- [21:36] Along with that um I uh provide um
- [21:41] examples of prompts how they should um
- [21:44] should be and should sound. And if you
- [21:46] look at the this prompt, you will see
- [21:49] how I provide very detailed character uh
- [21:52] description and voice description and
- [21:55] the visual appearance of the character.
- [21:58] This is all very important for uh those
- [22:01] videos to be consistent even though we
- [22:04] have those uh initial you know pictures
- [22:06] the start frame for the videos. Why?
- [22:09] Because um take this um you know view
- [22:12] number two. If the view number two zooms
- [22:14] out a bit, uh we want the clothing and
- [22:17] the you know the other other parts of
- [22:20] the body of copy bar to look the same as
- [22:22] as you know as a view that starts uh as
- [22:25] a video that starts with number four. So
- [22:28] those pieces are important and uh as you
- [22:30] know the video models they sort of like
- [22:32] work without context. They didn't know
- [22:34] what the other videos it just made. uh
- [22:36] uh all those instructions are extremely
- [22:38] important for um character consistency
- [22:43] and environment consistency for that
- [22:45] matter. So basically what I do is I pass
- [22:48] uh this whole prompt with the script. I
- [22:51] pass the the
- [22:54] four views that I generated using nano
- [22:56] banana. Uh and then it goes through uh
- [23:00] the sequencing and through calling uh
- [23:03] video agent and uh sorry yeah the video
- [23:05] generation agent and you can see that
- [23:08] every time it generates a piece it says
- [23:09] like oh video number one this is the
- [23:12] link and this is the piece of the script
- [23:14] that um it's it's going through and we
- [23:18] can scroll down and see that it
- [23:20] generated 92
- [23:23] uh videos for me but it again automate
- [23:26] everything Uh I got the list of all 92
- [23:29] URLs. It still requires human in the
- [23:32] loop. Let's be honest like the videos
- [23:34] that sometimes not perfect. So I watched
- [23:36] I personally watched every single
- [23:37] 8-second video. Um and uh then I didn't
- [23:41] like some videos. I didn't like uh video
- [23:43] number uh 49 because there was some like
- [23:47] weird glitch that view um made and I
- [23:50] have to regenerate it. it regenerated it
- [23:52] and I didn't like it again because it
- [23:54] sounded weird and it asked to regenerate
- [23:57] it again maybe just like a use different
- [23:58] view number and it did it again and I
- [24:01] got those um all those views and then uh
- [24:05] what I did next uh is um I used Gemini
- [24:09] CLI to join those videos together right
- [24:12] again all I did I just like copied this
- [24:15] list and I copied the two file I asked
- [24:17] Gemini CLI use fmc to join videos
- [24:20] together. And here u it did it. Let me
- [24:24] switch to uh my IDE.
- [24:28] >> That has to be some sort of like video
- [24:30] editing hack to use Gemini CLI to splice
- [24:34] together all of your videos.
- [24:36] >> Yep. So this is my anti-gravity. Um and
- [24:40] uh I'm actually working on another
- [24:42] version of this agent. Uh you can notice
- [24:44] that I I have script adaptation as
- [24:46] script litter at different as different
- [24:49] agents. Stay in tuned for for that
- [24:51] release. Uh but I I just wanted to show
- [24:54] you like
- [24:56] the kind of the structure of the agent.
- [24:58] I have this uh main agent with a huge
- [25:00] prompt how like it should read the
- [25:03] results of different uh sub agents and
- [25:05] how it should actually instruct them and
- [25:08] I was adding that uh human in the loop
- [25:10] moment when I wanted to wait after the
- [25:13] script adaptation and uh let me sort of
- [25:16] like make edit edits in the script. Um
- [25:21] what else? Yeah, and to make those
- [25:22] changes actually that's why I wanted to
- [25:24] show it. I use anti-gravity. So I just
- [25:27] opened my the previous version of of um
- [25:31] this engine that I built using uh just
- [25:33] Gemini CLI and I asked anti-gravity this
- [25:36] is what I want want to add and yeah it
- [25:40] uh it did all the work for me. It
- [25:42] adjusted the prompts. It removed all
- [25:44] prompts. It uh made changes in the agent
- [25:48] itself and sub aents. I'm I'm super
- [25:52] pumped and I just see how it uh improves
- [25:55] my uh productivity primarily because and
- [25:58] I that's the first time I'm I'm seeing
- [26:00] it. I prefer working in IDs over CLIs.
- [26:05] You probably all like waiting for for
- [26:07] that video and to see how how it goes
- [26:11] and what it shows and how capy bar
- [26:13] speaks. So let me just uh show the
- [26:17] result to you. So let me roll the video.
- [26:21] It's as you see it's 11 plus minutes. I
- [26:25] will probably just give you like one
- [26:26] minute to listen to uh and then yeah
- [26:29] everyone can listen to the entire video
- [26:32] which is a part of the repository that's
- [26:34] on GitHub hub.
- [26:37] >> Hi I'm Ana Cappy. Today we will talk
- [26:41] about safety and security for AI agents.
- [26:45] As AI agents grow in capability,
- [26:48] ensuring they operate safely and
- [26:50] securely is paramount.
- [26:53] It's crucial they align with your brand
- [26:55] values to avoid posing risks to your
- [26:57] reputation.
- [26:59] Uncontrolled agents can execute
- [27:01] misaligned actions, leak data, or
- [27:04] generate inappropriate content. Key
- [27:07] sources of risk include vague
- [27:10] instructions, model hallucination, and
- [27:13] prompt injections.
- [27:15] I would watch a coding tutorial from Ana
- [27:18] the Capivara easily on YouTube.
- [27:21] >> It's so funny. I couldn't stop watching
- [27:24] like my brain's like I'm hearing
- [27:26] security from an animal. Like you know
- [27:29] it's a pattern interrupt like you can't
- [27:30] help but watch it. But that was awesome.
- [27:32] >> I'm glad you liked it.
- [27:34] >> Okay, so we've covered so much. This was
- [27:36] such an exciting episode. So, thank you
- [27:38] Brandon for coming on and showcasing
- [27:40] your demo and having this wonderful
- [27:42] conversation with us on such an exciting
- [27:44] day.
- [27:45] >> Seriously, thank you Smith. Thank you
- [27:46] Vlad. I've been a little kid in a candy
- [27:48] shop playing with all these new models
- [27:50] from Gemini anti-gravity. So, seriously,
- [27:52] thank you guys for uh having me on
- [27:54] today. And also, I'm going to be
- [27:55] checking out that Cappy bar example
- [27:58] right after this. So, thank you for
- [27:59] sharing that as well, Vlad.
- [28:01] >> Thank you for joining us for today's
- [28:03] episode. I hope uh you enjoyed it. Uh,
- [28:06] please join us for the next episode.
- [28:08] Until then, keep your agent smart and
- [28:12] are you ready?
