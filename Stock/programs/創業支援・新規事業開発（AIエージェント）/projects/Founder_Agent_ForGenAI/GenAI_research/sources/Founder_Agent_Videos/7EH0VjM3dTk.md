- [00:00] well if you want to maintain hemony it
- [00:01] turns out like what did we do during
- [00:03] World War II will we like Henry Ford
- [00:05] here you go you're going to be
- [00:06] absolutely freaking rich because you're
- [00:08] going to make all the tanks right this
- [00:09] is sort of the same thing they're doing
- [00:10] with AI is like here you go Sacha Della
- [00:13] like you you get to do this in AI right
- [00:15] Dylan Patel has become one of the go-to
- [00:17] thinkers on all things hardware and AI
- [00:18] with his writing over at semi analysis
- [00:20] today on unsupervised learning I had an
- [00:22] awesome time chatting with him on a host
- [00:24] of different things it was particularly
- [00:25] fun because we talked right after the AI
- [00:27] diffusion rule came out so I got his
- [00:28] live reactions to what it means for
- [00:30] hyperscalers what it means for China the
- [00:31] UAE and others and what the future of
- [00:33] geopolitics looks like given these
- [00:34] regulations we also talked a lot about
- [00:36] some of the key questions in AI what
- [00:38] will happen with open source models what
- [00:39] are nvidia's long-term competitive Moes
- [00:41] and we also talked about what's required
- [00:43] to build really large clusters he had
- [00:45] some amazing stories from xai's 100,000
- [00:47] GPU cluster xai kind of came in and was
- [00:49] like well we can't find a data center
- [00:51] anywhere what they did is like the most
- [00:52] Elon awesome thing ever right which is
- [00:54] like I think folks will really enjoy
- [00:55] this conversation without further Ado
- [00:57] here's Dylan
- [01:00] dlan thanks so much for coming on yeah
- [01:02] thank you for having me it's a very cozy
- [01:04] comfortable place I can't believe we got
- [01:05] you like during AI diffusion rule week I
- [01:07] feel like this must just be Madness
- [01:09] right now yeah yeah I mean uh the fun
- [01:11] story was uh it was supposed to be
- [01:13] originally Monday uh they dropped on
- [01:16] Sunday night SL Monday right and so I
- [01:18] was like I was up all night working on
- [01:20] it and had to cancel and we we shifted
- [01:22] it back a few days so thanks for being
- [01:23] flexible and you shipped a pretty long
- [01:25] piece in the intro yeah yeah it was it
- [01:26] was great I'm curious if you just give
- [01:28] our listeners some like quick context on
- [01:29] what's going on on the regulatory side
- [01:31] with the ad diffusion Rule and then
- [01:32] maybe given the you know goals of what
- [01:34] they're trying to do uh what kind of
- [01:35] grade would you give it yeah so I think
- [01:38] originally right the October 2022
- [01:40] regulations were uh primarily on the
- [01:43] semiconductor industry uh but the the
- [01:45] wording there was like not minced at all
- [01:47] right it was we want to regulate AI um
- [01:50] we believe it's going to advance rapidly
- [01:52] this October 22 um which is were scaling
- [01:56] pre but they were scaling pilled right
- [01:58] exactly um and and like you know if you
- [02:00] get a chance to talk to some of the
- [02:01] people like um you know know Ben
- [02:04] Buchanan who's like the special adviser
- [02:05] in the White House like he's like you no
- [02:08] no this is exactly why we did it we knew
- [02:10] it was coming and it's like oh so the
- [02:11] government is actually quite competent
- [02:13] and it's quite interesting because you
- [02:16] know they they they hit really hard they
- [02:19] have the goal of like the US must be
- [02:22] ahead of China on AI right because uh
- [02:24] the next five years of progress next
- [02:26] three years next two years of progress
- [02:28] are going to shape the next you you know
- [02:31] Century of like hemony for the world
- [02:34] right and and so this is like taking an
- [02:36] acts to like try and stop Chinese
- [02:39] progress um as far as the grading right
- [02:41] October 22 was really well intentioned
- [02:44] from if you if you have this world view
- [02:46] right that that AI is you know in the
- [02:47] next five years going to transform the
- [02:49] world um you know if you have the view
- [02:51] that it's going to take 20 years then
- [02:52] it's a very different like story and
- [02:54] actually these regulations are actually
- [02:55] pretty bad um because they're going to
- [02:57] limit us competitiveness long term uh
- [02:59] but at least over the next 5 years they
- [03:01] definitely will like keep the us further
- [03:02] ahead so October 22 is really well
- [03:04] intentioned but there was like quite a
- [03:05] few loopholes so they did another round
- [03:07] in 23 then they did another round in
- [03:09] December um and all of these like have
- [03:12] like slowly patched over loopholes
- [03:13] there's still some um you know major
- [03:16] ones right namely Chinese companies can
- [03:18] get gpus from you know foreign firms
- [03:20] right so if you've seen the fuss that
- [03:22] oracle's been throwing um they they've
- [03:24] just been like ranting about it well
- [03:25] it's like look at who their largest one
- [03:27] of their largest cloud customers is it's
- [03:28] bite dance right right right um or you
- [03:31] know hey you can build a data center in
- [03:33] Malaysia now all of a sudden it's fine
- [03:34] right and so Malaysia from 2024 to 2027
- [03:39] uh not the country itself but companies
- [03:40] operating there mostly Chinese companies
- [03:42] many of them claiming they're now
- [03:44] Singaporean companies right like the
- [03:45] largest operator in China of data
- [03:47] centers in China GDs moved to Singapore
- [03:49] and says they're Singaporean now it's
- [03:51] like but now they're these companies are
- [03:52] building three gigs of data center
- [03:54] capacity to put that in context at the
- [03:56] beginning of 2024 that was roughly met
- [03:59] AS Global footprint right so it's like
- [04:01] oh wow like the entire world's like
- [04:04] social media is running off of you know
- [04:06] what Malaysia is putting up in three
- [04:08] years so what happens to all these like
- [04:09] you know Malaysian data center builds
- [04:11] given like you know uh obviously a big
- [04:13] part of this regulation is is both
- [04:14] during countries and then also applying
- [04:16] much more regulatory uh oversight of
- [04:17] like who's actually training models
- [04:18] within your data centers obviously all
- [04:20] this planning has gone into to building
- [04:22] these things but now it seems like the
- [04:23] rug's kind of been pulled out in some
- [04:24] way yeah I mean this is definitely the
- [04:26] most far-reaching regulation that I've
- [04:28] ever seen right um probably there were
- [04:30] big there were bigger things during the
- [04:31] Cold War or World War II I'm not sure um
- [04:34] but like this is very far-reaching in
- [04:36] that like it's regulating clouds
- [04:38] overseas right um it's regulating
- [04:40] foreign companies it's it's limiting
- [04:41] what they can buy to a huge extent and
- [04:43] so Malaysia has a huge amount of Data
- [04:45] Center capacity that's going to be
- [04:47] that's being built um we'll see if they
- [04:49] continue building it right you know I
- [04:50] think most people will still continue
- [04:51] building it um companies like Microsoft
- [04:54] and Oracle have significant assets uh
- [04:57] being built in Malaysia they probably
- [04:58] won't stop um but other companies you
- [05:01] know what what what happens now you know
- [05:03] at the end of the day the US is still
- [05:04] very limited on data center footprint as
- [05:06] well we're building as fast as we can
- [05:08] there's a lot of regulatory bottlenecks
- [05:10] there's there's a number of different um
- [05:13] things in that nature um but you know
- [05:17] what what happens as you deploy a you
- [05:18] know American companies deploy AI
- [05:20] globally right it's like is open AI
- [05:22] going to serve GPT in in in Japan and
- [05:24] Taiwan and South Korea or like do they
- [05:26] just run it out of Microsoft data
- [05:27] centers in Malaysia maybe right like
- [05:29] this could be a reasonable way to like
- [05:31] subsume this but like the really
- [05:33] important thing here and the like sort
- [05:35] of you know even if you're like very Pro
- [05:37] America anti China there's still huge
- [05:39] negatives to this regulation in that
- [05:41] like a ton of buyers can't buy you know
- [05:44] that Data Center capacity in Malaysia
- [05:46] actually deploy right like American
- [05:48] companies can't do that right and so you
- [05:50] know oracle is a good example right
- [05:52] they're one of the parts of the rule is
- [05:54] you can only have 7% of your data center
- [05:56] capacity in a in a country in any
- [05:58] country that's not like a US Ally right
- [06:00] these one countries and Oracle was to
- [06:03] have like 20% of their capacity in
- [06:04] Malaysia so now it's like what do I do
- [06:06] with these data centers that I was going
- [06:07] to build I'm obviously an American
- [06:08] company fine I won't rent it to Chinese
- [06:10] companies but like what do I do now so
- [06:13] there is a bit of like you know the
- [06:15] companies that have so much capacity in
- [06:18] the US um are the only ones that can now
- [06:21] take over these data centers in in
- [06:22] Malaysia and build 7% rule right because
- [06:25] of the 7% rule so like it's like
- [06:26] Microsoft meta Amazon Google right these
- [06:29] four companies have you know you know 70
- [06:31] plus% of their data center AI Data
- [06:33] Center capacity in the US um and so they
- [06:35] can they can like deal and they're
- [06:37] they're building super fast else they
- [06:38] can deal with like hey I'll take I'll
- [06:39] take 500 megawatts I'll take a gigawatt
- [06:41] in Malaysia and that won't break me out
- [06:43] of the ruling right um everyone else is
- [06:46] kind of like so so now you've like
- [06:47] reduced competition massively in the
- [06:49] market right um and you've created sort
- [06:52] of a monopoly and so this is sort of
- [06:54] like why these regulations while they
- [06:55] are like yes if your belief is like this
- [06:58] whole AI like
- [07:00] acceleration and like you know you need
- [07:01] to combat China uh this is very
- [07:03] important us must maintain hemony that's
- [07:05] one side of the fence the other side is
- [07:07] like well if you want to maintain hemony
- [07:08] it turns out like what did we do during
- [07:10] World War II well we like we're like
- [07:12] Henry Ford here you go you're going to
- [07:13] be absolutely freaking rich because
- [07:15] you're gonna make all the tanks right or
- [07:17] whatever right trucks um this this is
- [07:19] sort of the same thing they're doing
- [07:20] with AI is like here you go Sacha Nella
- [07:23] like you you get to do this in in AI
- [07:25] right um and so there's a bit of like
- [07:27] antitrust like you know know I like
- [07:29] decentralized power you like
- [07:31] decentralized Power you like Innovation
- [07:32] and does this like Stamp Out innovation
- [07:34] in some ways uh you know probably not
- [07:37] for American like startups but for like
- [07:40] infrastructure Hardware it definitely is
- [07:42] like pretty pretty bad obviously there's
- [07:44] been you know like uh proliferation of
- [07:46] players like cor weave and these folks
- [07:48] like how how do these regulations like I
- [07:49] mean ultimately you know I've heard you
- [07:50] say it obviously favors you know the the
- [07:52] giant tech companies but presumably like
- [07:53] they can have Footprints in these tier
- [07:55] one countries as well like what happens
- [07:56] to the kind of like you know the mini
- [07:58] Cloud ecosystem so I think I think cor
- [08:00] weave has rapidly like become quite
- [08:03] close to the hypers scale level right
- [08:05] like and so and then their their next
- [08:07] set of build outs like large build outs
- [08:08] are you know continued in the US of
- [08:10] course but then also Europe um I think
- [08:13] they could expand overseas for a while
- [08:15] and still be fine they're going to have
- [08:16] to hit certain regulatory like you know
- [08:19] levels for you know being able to
- [08:21] monitor their customers workloads and
- [08:23] all these like you know just when you
- [08:24] throw up the more requirements you add
- [08:27] less people who can do it yeah exactly
- [08:29] the the cloud ecosystem though right
- [08:30] excluding cor weave like is very much
- [08:32] hit hard right there's a lot of clouds
- [08:34] that are in foreign countries that are
- [08:36] trying to build up there's Sovereign AI
- [08:38] which is like you know a lot of startups
- [08:40] are Ser in the bay are serving Sovereign
- [08:42] AI firms in Malaysia and Singapore in
- [08:44] India in the Middle East whatever that's
- [08:45] their biggest customer and it's like
- [08:47] these guys are heavily heavily impacted
- [08:49] by these regulations um there's a lot of
- [08:51] um you know Cloud companies that are you
- [08:54] know I guess like tier one is like the
- [08:55] hyperscalers tier two is like core re
- [08:57] and Oracle and then like be below that
- [08:59] is like everyone is just kind of like
- [09:01] really hit really badly um and so you
- [09:04] know I think the startup ecosystem is
- [09:05] going to have to learn like what do I do
- [09:08] if potentially you know my big Middle
- [09:10] East customer or my big Singaporean
- [09:12] customer or my big Korean customer
- [09:14] whatever it maybe not Korea Korea is
- [09:15] like allowed um tier one but you know
- [09:18] one of these countries Sovereign AI
- [09:19] countries are they am I now regulated
- [09:21] like this is actually like potentially
- [09:23] bad for startups in some way it also is
- [09:25] diversity on the foundation model side
- [09:26] right um I guess like on The Sovereign
- [09:28] AI Point like contextualize before this
- [09:30] regulation what was happening both in
- [09:31] kind of the data center buildout world
- [09:33] uh you know that's government fueled as
- [09:34] well as like the kind of training core
- [09:36] models like for you know uh for a
- [09:38] specific country or geography it was
- [09:40] basically the wild west right the US had
- [09:42] an executive order a while back it was
- [09:44] basically just like if you're building a
- [09:45] model that's 26 flops which is like very
- [09:48] large that's like twice as large in
- [09:50] terms of flops as llama 405b right so I
- [09:53] presumably like very few people have
- [09:54] done that yet but it's like a
- [09:56] notification requirement that's it but
- [09:58] that's in the US right so if you're in
- [09:59] China and you're doing this or if you're
- [10:00] anywhere else it's fine of course there
- [10:02] were not really data center build outs
- [10:04] of the scale to hit that quite yet but
- [10:06] they were coming next year in the year
- [10:07] after right or 2025 2026 these build
- [10:10] outs were coming and so you know there
- [10:12] was not much regulating Foundation
- [10:15] models uh regulating other countries
- [10:17] from building Foundation models like
- [10:19] obviously like open Ai and and other
- [10:21] companies were like told like hey I know
- [10:24] the UAE is telling you they're going to
- [10:26] build you a massive cluster you're not
- [10:27] allowed to do that right like there's
- [10:29] obious viously things like that tacitly
- [10:30] under the table happening but there were
- [10:32] no like here are the regulations so you
- [10:35] know if you were a company in China you
- [10:37] would you know do whatever you want and
- [10:38] if you're a company elsewhere you do
- [10:39] whatever you want and you could rent gqs
- [10:41] from wherever you wanted and you could
- [10:42] build whatever you want um and this like
- [10:44] smacks it down right you can't like
- [10:46] export model weights right out outside
- [10:48] the US SL outside of like trusted clouds
- [10:51] which is again the hyperscalers right um
- [10:53] of of foundation models that are really
- [10:55] the like biggest big ones right um you
- [10:58] know like think llama 4 and GPT 5 and
- [11:00] that kind of stuff um or you can't like
- [11:03] um there's like various things around
- [11:05] like protecting against synthetic data
- [11:07] generation which all the Chinese
- [11:08] companies are doing a ton of synthetic
- [11:10] data generation of gp4 so their models
- [11:12] can be good right like this is part of
- [11:13] the like dirty secret about why like yes
- [11:15] Alibaba and deepseeker really good but
- [11:17] they're also just generating a bunch of
- [11:18] data from gp4 and using that to like
- [11:21] Post train right partially um there's a
- [11:23] lot of um regulations around um yeah
- [11:27] accessing clouds um and so a lot of
- [11:29] company a lot of clouds you know they
- [11:31] didn't have a core you know you know
- [11:34] like when you look at like the big tech
- [11:35] companies they've sort of all paired off
- [11:37] right um you know meta themselves
- [11:39] Google's themselves but then Microsoft
- [11:40] open AI Amazon anthropic um elon's world
- [11:44] is is xai Tesla you know there's the
- [11:46] lines are blurry right X the lines are
- [11:49] very blurry between these companies um
- [11:51] but like these are sort of the hypers
- [11:52] scalers in the US but in China um
- [11:54] Alibaba was doing good in AI um and they
- [11:57] were building out but besides that like
- [11:59] there's 's a bunch of new players
- [12:00] there's moonshot there's deep seek and
- [12:02] there's all these other players that are
- [12:03] popping up but they don't have a
- [12:05] hyperscale partner um bite dance of
- [12:08] course right and bite dance do they do
- [12:09] run a lot of their infrastructure but
- [12:11] they a lot of it they rent um you know
- [12:13] what do they do well they decided well
- [12:14] let me just like not b not uh deep seek
- [12:17] but like bite dances just like oh I'll
- [12:18] just rent from any GPU Cloud out there
- [12:20] right so there's random clouds in like
- [12:23] the in Europe there's random clouds all
- [12:24] over Asia right and it's like their
- [12:25] business case is like you're going to
- [12:27] make a decent profit right and you're
- [12:29] going to build gpus and rent them to me
- [12:31] right and I'm not you're not going to
- [12:32] have any observability to my workload
- [12:33] I'm just going to do whatever I want um
- [12:35] most of it is just serving Tik Tok right
- [12:37] let's be clear it's not actually like
- [12:39] elicit but you know the potential is
- [12:40] there and they're obviously working on
- [12:41] language models and generative video
- [12:43] models and there's always the like fear
- [12:45] that they're going to manipulate our
- [12:46] teenagers minds and you know destroy
- [12:49] after Sunday I guess I mean they're
- [12:50] still going to be able to do the latter
- [12:52] thing right but but they're heavily
- [12:54] heavily heavily limited on you know the
- [12:56] size of clusters they can get now and
- [12:58] and who and what and notification
- [12:59] requirements and like the companies have
- [13:01] to be able to be observe their workload
- [13:03] which is like bad security so it's it's
- [13:05] a really really big blow to of course
- [13:07] bite dance and many Chinese AI players
- [13:10] but it's also a huge blow to all these
- [13:11] random Cloud companies whose business
- [13:12] case was like I'm G to sell to bike
- [13:15] dance right or I'm gonna sell to this
- [13:16] Chinese company so where where does
- [13:18] Chinese ai go from here and like what
- [13:19] you do you see any kind of like if
- [13:21] they're looking around for loopholes
- [13:22] like what you know what is the path
- [13:24] forward there is there's one obvious
- [13:26] loophole which is um while there's like
- [13:28] strict caps right like each country can
- [13:30] only buy 50,000 gpus for the next four
- [13:32] years and it's like that's kind of
- [13:34] nothing when Nvidia is making you know 6
- [13:36] million plus this year tot right um it's
- [13:38] like huh um so so each country can only
- [13:41] buy 50,000 gpus but then there's still
- [13:43] loopholes which is if you buy 1,700 or
- [13:45] less that doesn't count to the 50k um so
- [13:48] so the obvious thing is you just spin up
- [13:50] a bajillion you know shell companies and
- [13:52] you just buy you buy 17 you buy 1600
- [13:54] gpus and and then you route them to
- [13:56] China or whatever right so there are
- [13:58] still some loopholes
- [13:59] um but generally you know this is this
- [14:02] is much harder to do I think I think
- [14:05] more more so is just like you know China
- [14:08] has a ton of amazing engineers and they
- [14:09] will have to innovate right like deep
- [14:11] seek is like amazing at engineering
- [14:13] right so it's like um you know they're
- [14:15] they're crushing companies with similar
- [14:17] levels of compute right um because
- [14:19] they're just engineering better but
- [14:20] they're not quite like open ey anthropic
- [14:22] level now they need to take this like
- [14:24] same like compute for collabs continues
- [14:26] to scale like crazy and theirs cannot
- [14:29] skill nearly as fast so it's like we not
- [14:30] only have to be better at engineering we
- [14:32] have to be like way way way way better
- [14:33] at engineering with this new push to
- [14:35] like test time compute like is that
- [14:36] feasible uh with with like a huge
- [14:38] compute deficiency yeah so so I think
- [14:41] there's um some interesting aspects of
- [14:45] test time compute right um it is way
- [14:47] more compute intensive than people think
- [14:49] like people are like oh training is dead
- [14:50] and it's like no building a test time
- [14:53] compute capable model requires tons of
- [14:56] of training you WR some really
- [14:57] interesting data about this it's it's
- [14:59] not just like pre-training it's
- [15:00] posttraining right so you have to
- [15:02] generate a ton of data you have to throw
- [15:03] most of it away um you have to verify
- [15:06] verify the data to make sure it's like
- [15:07] actually accurate right um The Chain of
- [15:09] Thought or the reasoning chain um and
- [15:12] then you have to train the model right
- [15:13] and you have all these reward models
- [15:14] it's like very complicated post training
- [15:15] stuff so um you know and and it's very
- [15:19] compute intensive actually um so you can
- [15:23] make reasoning models today right like
- [15:25] 01 and like you know deep seeks R1 I
- [15:28] think it is and Ali as a reasoning model
- [15:29] I can't remember the name off top of my
- [15:30] head but these these models like are
- [15:33] like the way you should think of it is
- [15:34] like you know scaling laws are log log
- [15:36] right so you can scale you can scale
- [15:38] data you can scale parameters you can
- [15:40] scale uh and and and and it's like well
- [15:42] both of those are sort of like petering
- [15:44] out right because data is not scaling
- [15:46] fast enough and you know just infinitely
- [15:48] growing parameters doesn't give you
- [15:49] anything right or it gives you doesn't
- [15:51] it gives you diminishing returns um but
- [15:53] we've scaled up this rung many times
- [15:54] right the training runs that these
- [15:55] Frontier labs are doing are billions of
- [15:58] dollars right and uh next year probably
- [16:00] tens of billions of dollars right it's
- [16:01] like scaling very fast you can only get
- [16:04] like a logarithmic Improvement on that
- [16:05] front every so often right whereas test
- [16:08] time compute we like at the Bottom Rung
- [16:10] of the ladder right and it's like oh I
- [16:12] can like climb up this ladder really
- [16:14] rapidly because oh right now we're
- [16:15] spending hundreds of thousands millions
- [16:17] you know tens of millions Bill hundreds
- [16:19] of millions billions right and and like
- [16:21] the compute deficiency doesn't like
- [16:23] matter until you get to the billions
- [16:24] plus scale yeah right um and so there
- [16:26] are many rungs that they can you know
- [16:28] out engineer with the limited compute
- [16:31] resources and and sort of catch up uh
- [16:34] but there's also the flip side of like
- [16:36] well anthropic openi Deep Mind Etc right
- [16:38] xal these guys are and and and many
- [16:40] startups in fact right like Mira startup
- [16:42] and so on and so forth are all scaling
- [16:44] up this ladder really quickly as well as
- [16:46] fast as they can um and so it's it's
- [16:49] it's interesting to see what's going to
- [16:51] happen I I think that you know that's on
- [16:53] the training side and on the inference
- [16:55] side you know it's like if you actually
- [16:58] like do a query of like 01 versus GPD 40
- [17:02] it's like yeah it cost like 20 cents for
- [17:03] a query and it costs like $6 for a query
- [17:06] right it's like it's like a a dramatic
- [17:08] difference now obviously the quality is
- [17:10] better and so that like and that $6 is
- [17:12] still way cheaper than like paying you
- [17:14] know someone who makes way more than $6
- [17:15] for that work um but it is like you know
- [17:19] and and it's scalable right uh whereas
- [17:21] like human resources are less scalable
- [17:23] um you know it's kind of like this is
- [17:26] this is this is a huge difference in
- [17:28] cost $6 is all inference and it's like
- [17:30] well you're limited on GPS you get into
- [17:32] China you're limited to 50,000 in all
- [17:34] these countries that are friendly to
- [17:35] China or even neutral to China right so
- [17:37] it's like it's going to be very hard to
- [17:39] get that scaling of compute on inference
- [17:43] right and you know you can throw as much
- [17:44] money as you want on training but to
- [17:46] actually like change the world right
- [17:48] again like if you believe AI is going to
- [17:50] change the world then you have to spend
- [17:52] a ton on inference rightt um even if the
- [17:55] margins are low right you know uh even
- [17:57] though like anthropics and open gross
- [17:59] margins on inference are like 75% a lot
- [18:01] of these other companies gross margins
- [18:02] on inference are like 10 20% even it's
- [18:04] 10 20% gross margins you know to
- [18:07] amortize the cost of like a $5 billion
- [18:09] model right like okay you need to do
- [18:11] like $10 billion of a of inference
- [18:13] revenue and it's like okay well then
- [18:14] that's like8 billion of Hardware cost
- [18:17] which you know and that Hardware cost of
- [18:19] $8 billion is like actually depreciated
- [18:21] over multiple years so in that year you
- [18:22] bought like $30 billion of Hardware
- [18:24] congrats right it's like this and that's
- [18:27] like way too much right like that's way
- [18:28] that's like like exceeds the Caps
- [18:29] dramatically so I think um you know test
- [18:32] time compute they'll be able to like
- [18:34] deliver impressive results probably the
- [18:36] question is if they'll be able to scale
- [18:37] it and sell it
- [18:39] um and and so that's like the the the
- [18:43] issue and like on the flip side it's
- [18:44] also like China the cost of developing
- [18:47] software in China is like way cheaper
- [18:49] than in the US right they just have way
- [18:51] more talented Engineers uh software
- [18:53] engineers and and so you know their
- [18:55] development practices and all these
- [18:57] things are different as well but like
- [18:58] every company there you know there's a
- [19:00] lot of like platform SAS doesn't work in
- [19:02] China right this is like pretty well
- [19:03] understood as like like and like in the
- [19:05] VC world it's been like amazing for VC
- [19:06] is that platform SAS type stuff has been
- [19:08] awesome um because you can sell to all
- [19:10] these companies because develop it
- [19:11] you're you're developing it in one place
- [19:13] and you're selling it to everyone right
- [19:14] whereas in China it's like okay you're
- [19:16] developing in one place but everyone can
- [19:18] just develop it internally and it won't
- [19:19] be maybe as good it won't be best in
- [19:20] class but whatever devs are cheap right
- [19:22] which kind of seems like the future
- [19:23] we're headed do with all this AI coding
- [19:24] progress this is what I'd be curious
- [19:26] about your take yeah no I mean I
- [19:27] definitely think it's it's it's a a huge
- [19:29] risk for these SAS providers right um
- [19:31] you know the ability I mean obviously
- [19:32] Clara and folks have talked about it
- [19:33] very publicly but I think the kind of Mo
- [19:35] that was spinning up these applications
- [19:37] in the past is uh is certainly a lot
- [19:40] weaker now and I think like the ability
- [19:42] also you know that combined with the
- [19:43] ability to more easily migrate data out
- [19:45] of whatever system of record you're in
- [19:47] um and basically all the like painful
- [19:48] stuff that probably stopped someone from
- [19:50] ever really upgrading their software in
- [19:51] the past is now just like a relatively
- [19:53] simple thing to do with a bunch of like
- [19:54] AI agents you throw it it go away for
- [19:56] like a few days and there it is um yeah
- [19:58] it's a real threat stas going forward
- [20:00] but a lot of countries have you know I
- [20:01] think clearly from the beginning have
- [20:02] realized the importance of having this
- [20:03] you know uh this expertise and models in
- [20:05] their own country but if anything this I
- [20:07] feel like this regulation makes
- [20:08] incredibly clear uh you know yeah yeah I
- [20:10] mean any point be cut off I think like
- [20:12] if you look at UAE this is exactly
- [20:14] what's happened and I think it's been
- [20:15] pretty well reported in the media like
- [20:17] at one point g42 which is the UAE sort
- [20:20] of champion of sovereign AI uh funded by
- [20:23] you know all sorts of like you know UAE
- [20:25] money and it is based in UAE and um they
- [20:28] they they were at one point like
- [20:29] threatened of being cut off and they
- [20:31] were like the CEO was like a Chinese guy
- [20:34] from China and it was like CCP links
- [20:36] potentially blah blah blah all this
- [20:37] stuff and then like you know goes s like
- [20:40] all the media reporting on this goes
- [20:41] silent for like six months and then the
- [20:43] next you know uh thing to come out from
- [20:45] like whether it was Bloomberg or Reuters
- [20:46] or Wall Street Journal whatever was like
- [20:49] yeah g42 and Microsoft are going to do a
- [20:50] partnership and it's like huh I wonder
- [20:53] like what happened here like is it is it
- [20:55] purely organic or was there like some
- [20:57] sort of like tacet like well if you're
- [20:59] just going to run all your own
- [21:00] infrastructure you know maybe there's
- [21:02] something that here but you know now
- [21:03] that we know Microsoft is partnered with
- [21:05] you you know it's good and like you know
- [21:07] now when you look at it it's like g42
- [21:09] and the US government are actually like
- [21:10] talking all the time and they're like
- [21:12] like g42 will be a big cloud player and
- [21:14] they're deploying gpus in the US even
- [21:16] not just in you know the UAE but in
- [21:18] Europe and the US so it's through these
- [21:20] hypers scolar I guess you can enforce
- [21:21] the American sphere of influence of like
- [21:23] what you know both obviously you know
- [21:25] oversight of what you know models are
- [21:26] out there and but also like you know
- [21:28] ultimately like who gets you know I
- [21:29] think right now there's what some human
- [21:31] rights terms involved in like the
- [21:32] tearing of the companies you could of
- [21:33] the countries and you could imagine like
- [21:35] all sorts of ways that uh
- [21:36] administrations use this stuff going
- [21:37] forward yeah I mean I mean like the
- [21:39] Biden the the regulation itself does
- [21:41] mention human rights um obviously the
- [21:43] new Administration is coming in if you
- [21:44] had me guess I'd say like 95%
- [21:47] probability the Trump Administration
- [21:48] just keeps these rules and maybe like
- [21:50] like obviously tweaks them to some
- [21:51] extent but the human rights thing
- [21:53] they're probably going to throw out and
- [21:54] like you know and switch for like you
- [21:56] know e American economic
- [21:59] influence or like industry or like
- [22:01] whatever whatever the priority of like
- [22:03] you know purchasing energy and weapons
- [22:04] from the US government right like these
- [22:06] are the sort of things that might matter
- [22:07] more for the Trump Administration versus
- [22:09] like human rights policies might matter
- [22:11] more for the Biden Administration but at
- [22:12] the end of the day yeah it's like a
- [22:13] weapon for sort of the arsenal of
- [22:15] democracy you know this is like a
- [22:17] regulation s enough it's like but I mean
- [22:19] taking a step back I feel like you've
- [22:20] talked before about and I think it was
- [22:21] maybe in the context of the chip band
- [22:23] about this like Goldilocks that you're
- [22:24] trying to strike of like preventing
- [22:26] China from training their own Cutting
- [22:27] Edge models but not making it like so
- [22:29] Barren that like everything gets built
- [22:31] up within the country itself and I
- [22:32] wonder like you know back to the I guess
- [22:34] the grade question like does it feel
- [22:35] like this you know hard-handed approach
- [22:38] like is that the right way to further
- [22:39] these policy objectives Jacob here
- [22:41] taking a quick break to say that if
- [22:42] you're enjoying this conversation with
- [22:44] Dylan we'd love if you could share it
- [22:45] with a friend we're always trying to get
- [22:47] the word out about unsupervised learning
- [22:48] and we have an absolutely fantastic set
- [22:50] of guests coming up these next months
- [22:52] now back to Dylan does it feel like this
- [22:55] you know hard-handed approach like is
- [22:57] that the right way to further these
- [22:58] policies objectives so I think um
- [23:00] October 22 and then the 2023 regulations
- [23:03] they were they were more like you know
- [23:04] we're going to try and limit you um but
- [23:07] they didn't like fully limit like China
- [23:09] building their own domestic supply chain
- [23:10] and all these things right um because
- [23:12] the intention is you can't build your
- [23:13] own domestic Supply chains and you can't
- [23:15] access it but you can access it at like
- [23:17] some tier right now like with these most
- [23:20] recent regulation it's like no access at
- [23:23] all to this stuff right like you have
- [23:24] you have order magnitude less compute
- [23:26] than like any of the US like labs right
- [23:29] um that's what we're trying to enforce
- [23:30] on you um in which case like obviously
- [23:32] there's going to be like some leakage
- [23:33] and so maybe it's not a whole order of
- [23:34] magnitude maybe it's like you know 75%
- [23:36] less compute whatever right it's still a
- [23:38] humongous amount so now it's like China
- [23:41] only has two options which is like build
- [23:43] your own supply chain or you know and
- [23:46] and if we limit that effectively right
- [23:48] like so like Ben Thompson has this take
- [23:49] and he's like yeah if you if the
- [23:51] regulatory regulations are so effective
- [23:53] on preventing China from building their
- [23:54] own semiconductor industry um or you
- [23:57] know sort of like or they like build
- [23:58] their own semiconductor industry and
- [24:00] it's like competitive then like action
- [24:03] on Taiwan is much more likely right
- [24:04] whereas like if they feel that they're
- [24:06] still benefiting from Taiwan right um
- [24:09] they feel that they still can build it
- [24:11] up and get access through Western sphere
- [24:12] right this is like the sort of like
- [24:13] geopolitical stuff I have no idea about
- [24:15] by the way right uh talking out my butt
- [24:17] but like there's sort of the like you
- [24:19] know the goldilock zone of like yeah you
- [24:20] don't want to ban them too hard you
- [24:21] don't want to let them just have
- [24:22] everything because then that like
- [24:24] induces risk right but if there's like
- [24:26] that goldilock zone of like you just
- [24:29] can't right like you're kind of like
- [24:30] you're behind but not so far behind
- [24:32] There's Hope of catching up then it's
- [24:33] may be fine I guess Switching gears to
- [24:35] you know the cluster build outs that
- [24:36] we're seeing today um maybe just give
- [24:38] some codex to listeners on you know
- [24:40] obviously you're you're the guru of of
- [24:41] tracking all this like the size of
- [24:43] cluster build outs we have today those
- [24:44] being planned and maybe just talk a
- [24:45] little bit about kind of the biggest
- [24:46] blockers that we have to larger clusters
- [24:48] today in these tier one countries yeah
- [24:50] so I mean when you take a step through
- [24:52] sort of like GPD 4 2020 you know uh 2022
- [24:55] sorry uh roughly 20 you know few
- [24:58] thousand gpus A1 100s right and they
- [25:00] train this model change the world right
- [25:03] um now what's the next sort of Step Up
- [25:06] right you know you got to look at like
- [25:07] from two to three to four right there's
- [25:09] order you know a couple orders of
- [25:10] magnitude of compute increases now you
- [25:12] know with GPT sort of five quote unquote
- [25:15] or Orion or whatever is coming out
- [25:16] they're you know working on it um this
- [25:18] is a scale of you know hey well we can't
- [25:20] necessarily go for you know order
- [25:22] magnitude more gpus because it's just
- [25:23] too expensive and there's a lot of uh
- [25:26] difficulties with building that out um
- [25:28] so we go up you know we go from 20,000
- [25:29] GPS to 100,000 right um and so X is
- [25:32] built 100,000 meta's built 100,000 both
- [25:35] of them have actually building more than
- [25:37] that right in one one spot to do
- [25:38] training openi plans are also and
- [25:40] anthropic you know so on and so forth
- [25:42] anthropic has 400,000 tranium server uh
- [25:45] gpus coming up this year um or tranium
- [25:48] chips not gpus but like there there
- [25:50] people are in the hundreds of thousands
- [25:51] range uh go for this year uh but you
- [25:54] know sort of what's built today and
- [25:55] what's training models today is on that
- [25:57] order of magnitude of ,000 right and the
- [25:59] GPU that's being used is the h100 so you
- [26:01] got you have 5x the gpus and you have 3x
- [26:04] the performance per GPU roughly so then
- [26:06] you're at like 15x more compute um and
- [26:10] we'll see what comes of this right like
- [26:12] you know the the thing is like you don't
- [26:14] build a cluster or run a model and
- [26:15] immediately get like you know something
- [26:17] great out of it right you have to like
- [26:18] do tons of experimentation and you know
- [26:20] training takes months and post training
- [26:22] takes months and safety takes months
- [26:23] right it's not like snap of the finger
- [26:25] you get the model right now that you've
- [26:27] built the cluster uh um and so there is
- [26:29] a bit of a lag right and so you know
- [26:32] this year we'll see models come out that
- [26:34] are from that sort of quote unquote last
- [26:36] generation cluster but the next
- [26:38] generation one is being built now what
- [26:39] this next generation one is like
- [26:41] hundreds of thousands right um and for
- [26:43] context right like you know each GPU
- [26:46] right once you include networking
- [26:47] building all this sort of stuff maybe is
- [26:49] you know the GPU itself of h100 is like
- [26:51] 24,000 but once you add everything else
- [26:53] up it's like 445,000 per GPU all in of
- [26:57] everything right and so the cost of like
- [26:59] 100,000 is like like a lot right it's
- [27:02] like5 billion for 100,000 gpus yeah
- [27:05] right um and so elon's round was six
- [27:07] billion and uh you know he built 100,000
- [27:10] GPU cluster right like you know
- [27:11] obviously there's like other costs right
- [27:13] they had to buy data they had to do like
- [27:15] um you know employees and they had to do
- [27:17] like they had to convert a factory into
- [27:19] a data center right and like set up all
- [27:21] this crazy [ __ ] that they did right
- [27:23] which is like you know I'll talk about
- [27:24] that in a second but like there's a lot
- [27:25] of stuff that needs to be done to get
- [27:29] um you know a model train and now now
- [27:31] that elon's built the cluster doesn't
- [27:32] mean a model's going to come out you
- [27:33] know I'd be surprised if they have a
- [27:35] leading model even this quarter right um
- [27:37] it's going to take some time and there
- [27:39] and and so like what is what is you know
- [27:40] that's on the training front um and and
- [27:43] these next Generation clusters be built
- [27:44] this year not $5 billion they're they're
- [27:46] you know 15 right you know and obviously
- [27:48] you can't scale the money up you know
- [27:50] like insane amounts but 3x right and and
- [27:53] obviously in the con of that anthropic
- [27:54] raising this like2 billion that you know
- [27:56] in this current VC round seems
- [27:58] perplexing well so what's nice is you
- [28:00] know anthropic open AI anthropic
- [28:03] especially can you know open Ai and and
- [28:06] and you know some of these companies
- [28:07] that are the startups right uh can can
- [28:10] raise around and that money can only be
- [28:12] enough for maybe a year year and a half
- [28:14] of GPU rental right and that's rental
- [28:16] right they're not the one buying the
- [28:17] gpus right so Amazon might be the one
- [28:19] spending you know5 10 billion dollar but
- [28:22] they might for one year rent it for 3
- [28:24] four right um and you know when you look
- [28:26] at the revenue the credits they get from
- [28:28] Amazon Plus the round they raise right
- [28:30] that's enough to pay for something like
- [28:32] that right now the the and and the
- [28:34] trainum server is not $10 billion
- [28:35] because it's like a cheaper internal
- [28:37] chip for Amazon but like you kind of get
- [28:39] this like benefit if your Cloud partner
- [28:41] really loves you right and in the case
- [28:43] of like open aai and Microsoft kind of
- [28:46] but they were able to make a deal strike
- [28:47] a deal with Oracle right Oracle spending
- [28:50] like 10 Billion Dollar Plus for them
- [28:52] this year to build out data centers and
- [28:54] gpus right um for open AI uh not
- [28:57] Microsoft and interestingly enough
- [28:59] Microsoft is doing stuff as well but
- [29:00] like but they're not rent they're not
- [29:02] charging $10 billion this year right
- [29:04] they're charging a few billion dollars
- [29:05] this year so there is there is that
- [29:08] benefit right that you don't need to
- [29:09] necessarily you might have signed the
- [29:10] dotted line and like Oracle may like
- [29:12] have taken the credit risk right of like
- [29:15] we or we opening on this contract exist
- [29:17] in three years I mean you and I believe
- [29:19] yes but like this is something that you
- [29:21] have to consider as a possibility no um
- [29:24] and so there is that risk um and like
- [29:26] the numbers that like companies are
- [29:27] raising not enough to pay for the whole
- [29:29] cluster but that just means you know
- [29:30] anthropic is going to raise even more 9
- [29:33] months from now or a year from now
- [29:34] whenever they release their reasoning
- [29:35] model you know it's a constant
- [29:36] fundraising thing right this like Sam
- [29:38] strength is like he's a god tier
- [29:39] fundraiser right um and so that's like
- [29:43] one aspect of it the other aspect is
- [29:45] like when you look at the hyperscalers
- [29:46] right meta Google uh Amazon um xai you
- [29:49] know all these guys are building their
- [29:50] own data centers they're the ones de
- [29:52] delivering the capex it's really hard to
- [29:55] get the electrical infrastructure uh the
- [29:57] substation build it all out get it to
- [29:59] work uh get all the chips to be
- [30:01] networked properly uh deal with all the
- [30:03] failed chips because when you're talking
- [30:04] about you know this number of chips
- [30:06] actually quite a few are failed a lot of
- [30:07] them are silent failures there's a lot
- [30:08] of difficulties in getting a cluster to
- [30:10] work um and so like you know the big big
- [30:13] data center guys have like sort of like
- [30:15] known this right the hyperscalers xai
- [30:17] kind of came in and was like El's like
- [30:19] well we're just going to do it and it's
- [30:20] like well we can't find a data center
- [30:21] anywhere cuz all of them are already
- [30:23] taken right uh for for the time frames
- [30:26] we need so what do we do right and and
- [30:29] like what they did is like just like the
- [30:30] most like Elon awesome thing ever right
- [30:32] which is like they found a random
- [30:34] Appliance Factor closed Appliance
- [30:36] Factory in Memphis Tennessee right
- [30:38] located next to like a giant power plant
- [30:41] water treat treatment facility like a
- [30:43] garbage dump like like just like
- [30:45] literally like what most people in SF
- [30:47] would be like this is the worst place on
- [30:48] [ __ ] earth right like not not really
- [30:50] but like um you know you talk to people
- [30:52] at X that actually go to the data center
- [30:54] like this place kind of sucks right like
- [30:57] Memphis has really good Wings by the way
- [30:58] you know there's good inh across the
- [31:00] yeah great food in Memphis but like
- [31:02] wings barbecue Etc but like you know
- [31:04] it's like okay we bought the suppliance
- [31:06] factory but why did we buy it well one
- [31:08] there's a gigawatt um natural gas plant
- [31:11] right next door right two there's a
- [31:13] natural gas line a main that they tapped
- [31:16] and they set up their own generation
- [31:18] capacity on site you know three they're
- [31:20] upgrading the substation take more power
- [31:22] from the grid right so they're like
- [31:23] doing they set up their own like
- [31:24] freaking mobile generators to like
- [31:27] create power setting up Tesla battery
- [31:29] packs uh they're now planning they've
- [31:31] filed permits to build their own [ __ ]
- [31:33] power plant right like uh on site not
- [31:36] just like mobile generators but like a
- [31:37] massive natural gas combine you know so
- [31:40] they can do a million gpus or is what he
- [31:42] claims right or what he says he's going
- [31:43] to do which you know we'll see um I
- [31:45] won't bet against Elon right there's
- [31:47] he's doing all these like things to like
- [31:49] get the data center now right because
- [31:51] there's no power you know the substation
- [31:53] wasn't ready right the power is right
- [31:54] there but the substation was was not was
- [31:56] too small and it was being upgraded to
- [31:57] slowly because you know us power grid
- [32:00] upgrades take a long time take at least
- [32:02] 6 months a year they had already thought
- [32:03] about it but it was only like six months
- [32:04] a year like okay we'll just generate
- [32:05] power on the site right so they tap the
- [32:07] natural gas line that's next door and
- [32:08] they set up all these mobile generators
- [32:10] right oh the power from these generators
- [32:11] is pretty dirty and GPU training is like
- [32:13] you know the moment I stop training
- [32:15] power just goes to zero or you know
- [32:17] maybe if I'm doing a gradient update now
- [32:19] all my gpus go idle and like they're
- [32:21] exchanging weights and it's like oh [ __ ]
- [32:22] power went to zero then it's like oh
- [32:24] [ __ ] power went to 100 megawatts and
- [32:26] like this sort of stuff can blow up
- [32:27] grids um and so you know elon's like
- [32:30] okay we'll just throw a bunch of Tesla
- [32:31] battery packs there's doing all sorts of
- [32:32] crazy things oh how do we you know how
- [32:34] do we cool this this facility because it
- [32:36] wasn't ready to be able to cool this
- [32:38] much amount of stuff oh we'll water cool
- [32:39] everything and then we'll rent a bunch
- [32:40] of chillers water chillers like many of
- [32:43] them restaurant grade like freaking
- [32:45] container things and just place them
- [32:46] outside and like cool right it's like
- [32:48] they're doing all this like crazy stuff
- [32:49] and it's like way more complicated than
- [32:51] this right and it works right it's like
- [32:52] it's like very impressive um how they
- [32:55] deal with all the problems uh I guess
- [32:57] one more fun funny stories like this
- [32:58] power problem I mentioned meta they
- [33:00] accidentally open sourced this code um
- [33:03] it's literally called Power Plant no
- [33:04] blow up it's a flag um and so when
- [33:06] you're doing the gradient update right
- [33:08] when you're like exchanging weights um
- [33:10] instead of like having the gpus go idle
- [33:12] right basically when you're when you're
- [33:13] sending all the weight to the network
- [33:15] instead they just have them do fake M
- [33:17] Matrix multip so the power stays stable
- [33:20] right because otherwise like the power
- [33:21] plant might blow up if you go like this
- [33:23] and it's like what the hell right so
- [33:25] like this is like the crazy stuff that's
- [33:26] happening and it's like um you know
- [33:28] there's so many complicated things going
- [33:30] on in these you know 10 billion doll
- [33:32] build outs that people are doing
- [33:33] fascinating if you were running like the
- [33:34] government right now I mean what like
- [33:36] obviously it seems like the energy side
- [33:37] is like a massive policy and and just
- [33:39] like bureaucratic blocker to more of
- [33:41] these data centers happening like what's
- [33:42] the best thing that government can be
- [33:43] doing to unblock this stuff and you know
- [33:45] is every future data center buildout
- [33:47] like this going to have to pck together
- [33:48] Elon style you know I mean I mean like
- [33:51] to be clear right like the the like
- [33:53] number of like normally built
- [33:54] conventionally built data centers is
- [33:56] like this it's just like what we want is
- [33:58] like straight line up right like you
- [34:00] know um and so you know for example uh
- [34:04] gas generators are sold out for two four
- [34:06] years from GE right like it's like oh
- [34:08] wow vnova I guess now right um
- [34:10] substation equipment same thing right
- [34:12] it's like sold out for four years so
- [34:13] like now you have to get like creative
- [34:14] right um and so like even though it's
- [34:17] like growing really rapidly so like some
- [34:18] of the stuff is like held up by like I
- [34:20] think in one part of like uh the Midwest
- [34:23] it might be Ohio or Indiana the P the
- [34:26] cost of like if you build a new power
- [34:27] plant to transport that power on the
- [34:30] grid to a customer cost more than the
- [34:32] cost of actually generating the power
- [34:34] it's like what the flip right like it's
- [34:36] like so like the grid needs huge
- [34:37] Investments right um there needs to be
- [34:40] like a removal of a lot of the
- [34:41] environmentally reg environmental
- [34:43] regulations um but also to an extent
- [34:45] there needs to be like more Vibe shift
- [34:47] of like ESG type stuff right is like
- [34:50] what is like is is like and this is like
- [34:51] the attitude of like people at AI Labs I
- [34:53] don't know if it's actually true or or
- [34:55] or like it's the correct one but like
- [34:58] maybe you just say screw it to build AGI
- [35:00] faster we we do it with natural gas and
- [35:03] then because we're doing it with natural
- [35:05] gas and then AGI will like create enough
- [35:07] economic wealth and prosperity that we
- [35:09] can just do carbon sequestration and it
- [35:10] will all be good right it's like this is
- [35:12] a pretty like wild take but this is like
- [35:13] this is what some people believe and and
- [35:15] to some extent meta has kind of uh you
- [35:19] know either for either you know they
- [35:21] laid off their whole like Dei thing they
- [35:24] they uncensored politics there's been a
- [35:25] massive Vibe shift one of the things
- [35:27] they're doing is like they're setting up
- [35:28] two GW right I told you earlier four
- [35:31] sorry three was like their total Global
- [35:32] capacity beginning of 24 they're setting
- [35:34] up 2 gws in Louisiana alone basically
- [35:37] all powered by natural gas um and it's
- [35:40] like yeah now they can get in two years
- [35:42] right and they've like figured out how
- [35:42] to get the substations and all that
- [35:44] whatever they they've gotten all the
- [35:45] supply chain stuff and it's like yeah if
- [35:47] we just throw ESG out the window can go
- [35:49] faster right and and and like you're
- [35:51] doing it in states that don't have as
- [35:53] much environmental stuff Texas and
- [35:55] Louisiana and so on and so forth right
- [35:57] many other States uh you know all over
- [35:59] the country but it's like you know
- [36:01] that's part of it right now to this to
- [36:03] this moment right like Google and Amazon
- [36:04] are still quite like committed to their
- [36:06] green pledges Microsoft is sort of in
- [36:08] the middle and Meta Meta and xai
- [36:10] obviously don't give a [ __ ] right so
- [36:11] it's like you or they don't not that
- [36:13] they don't give a [ __ ] right like
- [36:14] obviously like xai like Tesla does way
- [36:17] more for green than what they're
- [36:18] destroying right so it's like all sorts
- [36:19] of like you know it's complicated but
- [36:21] like is there a way to like change the
- [36:23] vibe on those two and therefore they
- [36:24] move faster right or is there a way to
- [36:26] like um make it so you don't have to do
- [36:29] crazy stuff like grids are upgraded
- [36:31] power generation is is you know like
- [36:33] on-site power generation like all these
- [36:34] different things like um help build
- [36:36] solar and wind and uh batteries faster
- [36:39] and cheaper in addition to doing all the
- [36:41] gas right um there's a lot of
- [36:43] complicated things to do um on the
- [36:46] energy side and there's ways to still
- [36:48] make it green and fast right like you
- [36:50] could just throw up a lot of solar you
- [36:51] can throw up a lot of wind and you know
- [36:53] the the power generation of like
- [36:55] Renewables are like this but wind and
- [36:57] solar don't don't actually like
- [36:58] correlate that well so then you're like
- [37:00] most of the times you have power
- [37:01] obviously you have Excess power
- [37:03] sometimes um but most of the times you
- [37:04] have power and then you throw on like a
- [37:05] small amount of battery and now it's
- [37:07] like almost all the time you have power
- [37:08] but there's still like times where the
- [37:09] sun isn't shining and the wind isn't
- [37:11] blowing for a long enough period that
- [37:12] your batteries are drain so now you have
- [37:14] some backup gas right and it's like
- [37:16] these are ways to like make it Greener
- [37:17] and still do it fast but yeah I think I
- [37:19] think like grid um an industrial policy
- [37:22] around that is like the biggest like
- [37:25] thing that needs to be done to
- [37:26] accelerate this kind like the domestic
- [37:28] version of uh now now that we've done
- [37:30] the uh the international regulations
- [37:31] it's the next next area of focus yeah
- [37:34] you would think right it's like like I I
- [37:36] myself of like far more of like an
- [37:38] attitude of like we should win harder
- [37:41] rather than we should like try to make
- [37:43] them lose yeah right like that's sort of
- [37:45] like I think like most people think
- [37:47] that's a better ideal and like what
- [37:50] America stands for more but you know we
- [37:51] kind of like yeah so we have these
- [37:53] 100,000 uh GPU clusters obviously now
- [37:56] where we're going to see the output of
- [37:57] these model at some point in 2025 and I
- [37:58] assume that will obviously impact a ton
- [38:00] of the you know future Investments based
- [38:02] on what we see there but obviously
- [38:03] people have to invest way ahead of that
- [38:04] and so we already kind of know what
- [38:05] we're getting in for uh for for build
- [38:07] outs in this next year as you kind of
- [38:09] think you know uh just kind of putting
- [38:11] your betting hat on for like two years
- [38:13] from now five years from now like how
- [38:15] big clusters do you think we'll have two
- [38:17] years from now yeah um I would I would
- [38:20] imagine it' be like you know like
- [38:21] there's a couple things right like you
- [38:23] know you could say it by number of chips
- [38:24] but it's not fair right A1 100s were
- [38:26] like 400 h00 are 700 wat black well is
- [38:29] 1200 wat right you know sort of the
- [38:31] power per chip is scaling rapidly so
- [38:33] saying the number of chips is not fair
- [38:35] energy right so energy is like a good
- [38:37] metric because it's like how much useful
- [38:38] work you get per me energy is like
- [38:40] growing rapidly right um but then like
- [38:42] the amount of energy you're devoting to
- [38:44] this right so so 150 megawatts is these
- [38:46] 100K clusters right um we're seeing like
- [38:49] you know 400 500 megawatts uh cluster
- [38:53] sort of being built out now right like
- [38:55] you know and and then you know in 2020
- [38:57] I'd imagine it'll be like gwatt skill
- [38:59] clusters right or that's what it looks
- [39:01] like based on or you know one gwatt in
- [39:03] 2026 is and Meta Meta is like trying to
- [39:06] do like two gws by early to mid 27 so
- [39:09] it's like and others are all like sort
- [39:10] of doing similar stuff um in different
- [39:12] parts of the nation it's like these
- [39:14] build outs are are rapidly like sort of
- [39:16] escalating to
- [39:18] like Earth shattering amounts of like
- [39:20] power in one spot right um so you know
- [39:23] and then and then like obviously the
- [39:25] like dollars per chip and then the power
- [39:27] all this these are variables that change
- [39:29] over time um but yeah the the the build
- [39:31] outs are are scaling right when you go
- [39:33] from like 20,000 gpus 400 watts each you
- [39:36] know that was you know that was like on
- [39:38] the order of like you know 20 megawatts
- [39:41] to 2 gaws from 2022 to 2026 27 it's like
- [39:46] holy crap you just scaled that much
- [39:49] power totally in you know two orders of
- [39:51] magnitude in in like five years so if
- [39:54] we're sitting here at the end of 27 how
- [39:55] how much money is open a raised
- [39:58] oh I I think I think it'd be you know
- [40:01] really difficult to say you know I I
- [40:03] really do think it would be like north
- [40:04] of 100 billion right like that's that's
- [40:07] like yeah like like uh it's it's it's
- [40:10] pretty clear that they've been trying to
- [40:12] convince like um all these like
- [40:14] sovereigns to invest and like they've
- [40:16] been like passive on getting them but
- [40:18] like I think like you know you're going
- [40:19] to see 03 release you'll probably see
- [40:21] another reasoning model release you
- [40:22] might see gp5 release it's like how are
- [40:24] they not going to raise a ton ton more
- [40:25] money at a ton higher valuation Revenue
- [40:27] skyrockets right like it's like pretty I
- [40:29] think I think that's what's going to
- [40:30] happen um and I think this similar stuff
- [40:33] obviously open ey will lead the pack but
- [40:35] like others will also get you know
- [40:38] similar trajectories happening like
- [40:40] anthropic xai um you know I think I
- [40:43] think like yeah the amount of capital
- [40:44] that will be deployed is going to be
- [40:46] insane you know on the model side
- [40:47] obviously we've seen this massive
- [40:48] scaling of test time compute you know it
- [40:50] seems to work really well with easily
- [40:51] verified data you know coding math I
- [40:53] think there's this big question of like
- [40:54] what other tasks will fall into these
- [40:56] test time compute models what's your
- [40:57] thinking on that so I think I think like
- [41:00] I really like like when opening I
- [41:02] released the like five levels thing I
- [41:03] thought a lot of people were like
- [41:04] puzzled like what the [ __ ] is you know
- [41:06] it's like reasoning and then and then
- [41:08] agents like because everyone's been you
- [41:09] know the startup ecosystem is like chat
- [41:12] Bots agents right um and I think that
- [41:15] it's like I think it makes a lot of
- [41:17] sense because test time compute like
- [41:20] you're you're like verifying your
- [41:21] outputs and you're making sure they're
- [41:23] accurate right so I think I think like
- [41:24] and these these like test time compute
- [41:26] methods right of synthe data generation
- [41:28] and then throwing away a lot of it and
- [41:29] verifying it and using it right this is
- [41:31] where other modalities can come in right
- [41:34] so like computer use is like kind of
- [41:37] predicated on all these synthetic data
- [41:39] uh generation pipelines and test time
- [41:40] compute working agents are all
- [41:42] predicated on like the reliability of a
- [41:44] model getting high enough to where you
- [41:46] can actually like you know get the
- [41:48] answer reliability and chain multiple
- [41:50] together right and it's like these
- [41:52] different paradigms I think will stack
- [41:53] together right like it's like you can't
- [41:55] do computer use without test time
- [41:56] computer you can't do um agents without
- [41:59] test time compute and uh when you
- [42:02] combine test time you know computer use
- [42:04] agents it's like oh wow you know it's
- [42:06] like this now it's like autonomously
- [42:07] working on the computer without even
- [42:09] like you know having to like manually
- [42:11] code in all the apis that's it's
- [42:12] accessing and all this right it's like I
- [42:13] think like what tasks it can do will
- [42:15] like bro Branch out drastically once you
- [42:18] get the core of like reasoning like sort
- [42:20] of not solved but like at a really
- [42:23] strong point um and the pipelines for
- [42:25] doing all this stuff right um and so I
- [42:27] think that's probably now like what kind
- [42:29] of use cases that is is like I think
- [42:31] it's like whatever you know SAS business
- [42:33] mod of course like coding is great but
- [42:35] it's like what about software
- [42:35] engineering right because coding is very
- [42:37] different than software engineering um
- [42:40] you know it's like it's like customer
- [42:41] service like great chat Bots do that
- [42:42] kind of but like not great right like oh
- [42:45] searching through documentation right
- [42:47] like rag is okay but like actually you
- [42:49] need to like rag is really bad because
- [42:51] there's no way to verify that you
- [42:52] properly pulled in the right stuff right
- [42:54] your retrieval actually worked um people
- [42:57] can be like oh our retrieval is really
- [42:58] accurate but it's still like not
- [42:59] accurate enough for an agent um and so
- [43:02] like you know when you stack these
- [43:03] things together I think like any like
- [43:05] it's really any like information task I
- [43:08] I don't see why it wouldn't work now
- [43:09] obviously what what gets done in 25 26
- [43:12] is very different than what might get
- [43:13] done in 2030 um I don't know if I'm like
- [43:16] the best to like say like what specific
- [43:18] use case though right I think I can just
- [43:20] see sort of the writing in the wall is
- [43:21] like clear what about like the open
- [43:23] source side I mean obviously open source
- [43:24] models have been relatively quick to
- [43:26] catch up to you know the through gbt 40
- [43:29] type level models I think there is a big
- [43:31] question on on you know with these test
- [43:33] time compute models even in the
- [43:34] regulations themselves right I mean I
- [43:35] think the the way they framed it is like
- [43:37] you know open source models all fair
- [43:38] game and there's much more you know
- [43:39] whatever the open source models uh
- [43:41] capabilities are is up till then is fine
- [43:43] and then basically it kind of almost
- [43:44] assumes there's going to be some massive
- [43:45] gap between uh between Clos and open
- [43:48] models that just increases over the next
- [43:49] few years is that how you seeing things
- [43:51] too I think I think so I agree right
- [43:53] like I think meta will release llama 4
- [43:55] and it'll be better than gbd4 right uh
- [43:57] you know obviously like you know you can
- [43:59] say open source models have closed the
- [44:00] Gap but it's like does anyone have a
- [44:02] voice mode right does anyone have like
- [44:04] um quite the level of inference cost
- [44:06] that anthropic and open I do no not
- [44:08] really because their models are are
- [44:10] really efficient right um 40 is like
- [44:12] much smaller than llama 405b in terms of
- [44:15] active parameters right like way smaller
- [44:17] so it's like you know there is still
- [44:18] like open models are are behind uh maybe
- [44:21] not in capabilities entirely but in some
- [44:23] ways I think what actually like um ends
- [44:26] up happening is that
- [44:28] like reasoning models are not
- [44:32] necessarily going to be fully open
- [44:35] sourced uh even like you know like you
- [44:37] see the Deep seek model you see open
- [44:39] eyes model right meta will release
- [44:40] better models as long as they think it
- [44:41] makes sense to but will they only
- [44:43] release chat and completion models or
- [44:46] you know internally they have a their
- [44:47] own code model that like is trained on
- [44:49] their own code database in in addition
- [44:51] to all the stuff in llama and it's like
- [44:52] well that's not being released and that
- [44:54] one's far more capable right at least at
- [44:56] coding right it's like um so there's
- [44:58] like things like this that like I think
- [45:01] it point to like okay meta is not going
- [45:02] to just open source everything right
- [45:04] right I don't think that necessarily
- [45:06] like means that like you're putting
- [45:08] together the reasoning system right or
- [45:10] the agent system right it might mean
- [45:12] here's the based weights congrats we
- [45:14] didn't do any of the reasoning training
- [45:15] or like here's the instruct model or
- [45:17] maybe we even do some reasoning right
- [45:19] but it's like we're
- [45:21] we're I guarantee you if meta has the
- [45:23] best model in the world they will not
- [45:24] open source it yeah like that's like I
- [45:26] would would guess can they be like you
- [45:28] know can it feel like hey they're 69
- [45:29] months behind with a reasoning model
- [45:31] like you know when when uh will there be
- [45:33] like an open source equivalent to 03 in
- [45:35] six nine months yeah I mean that's
- [45:37] that's a great question I'm not I'm not
- [45:39] exactly sure um I don't think so
- [45:41] actually yeah um I think like 03 like
- [45:44] especially depending on like what level
- [45:45] of like compute you throw at it right
- [45:47] like if you looked at the arc challenge
- [45:49] like seems unlikely to me yeah um but at
- [45:52] the same time Google's already got a
- [45:53] reasoning model anthropic allegedly has
- [45:55] one internally that's like really good
- [45:57] better than 03 even but you know we'll
- [45:58] see um when they eventually release it
- [46:00] like it's like what actually ends up
- [46:03] happening is going to be very feels like
- [46:05] the whole question is like how much
- [46:06] capex is meta willing to spend to you
- [46:08] know to keep up with these I mean I
- [46:09] think I think they'll keep up on compute
- [46:10] it's like the science is hard too right
- [46:12] it's not just like you know you know
- [46:14] some level of compute I mean the numbers
- [46:16] you're counting if opening eye by the
- [46:17] end of 27 is raised hundred billion doll
- [46:19] um that's a lot of money to put toward
- [46:21] uh free open source models yeah I mean
- [46:23] like but like most of like to be clear
- [46:25] most of meta's GP purchases are for like
- [46:27] like recommendation systems on Instagram
- [46:30] right like it's like you can say like
- [46:33] Zuck can be like oh hey I bought this
- [46:34] many gpus on like some stream or
- [46:36] whatever but then when you dig into it
- [46:38] it's like well more than half of those
- [46:39] are like for recommendation systems like
- [46:41] chill like they're not like you know
- [46:42] you're not spending $30 billion on llm
- [46:46] infra infra or or Transformers you're
- [46:48] doing this on like all your products
- [46:50] right um I think I think yeah I just
- [46:52] think metal won't open source like
- [46:55] everything they do right um and I think
- [46:57] that
- [46:58] like llama 4 will be open sourced but
- [47:01] like the moment that they have something
- [47:04] at such a capability level I don't see
- [47:07] why like they would open source it
- [47:09] because they get benefit from they get
- [47:11] to attract a lot of talent they get to
- [47:13] have the whole Community tell them what
- [47:14] they're doing wrong with their models
- [47:15] right like you look at llama 2 llama
- [47:16] three people are like oh yeah you're
- [47:18] doing your um your your RL wrong these
- [47:21] ways right you're like lobotomizing the
- [47:23] model in these ways and people are like
- [47:24] and meta is learning from that right
- [47:25] you're like I think and they're
- [47:27] attracting all this talent that you know
- [47:30] if they have the best model they're not
- [47:31] going to do that if they're like six to
- [47:32] nine months behind um maybe they're six
- [47:35] to nine mons behind on capabilities but
- [47:37] then the cost is way higher for
- [47:38] inference or maybe cost is the same on
- [47:40] inference but their capabilities are
- [47:41] worse right and it's like um if you look
- [47:44] at any specific benchmark it's like oh
- [47:46] five percentage points great but it's
- [47:47] like those benchmarks that are in the
- [47:49] 70s and 80s are irrelevant it's about
- [47:51] like oh you're like 10% on this
- [47:53] Benchmark versus 50% right and like when
- [47:55] you look at like the like like sweep
- [47:56] bench and like things like that it's
- [47:58] like delas are getting really big yeah
- [47:59] the Deltas are really large right or
- [48:01] like Arc right it's like oh yeah yeah
- [48:03] there's only like two models that like
- [48:05] even score you know any reasonable
- [48:07] amount right it's like the these are the
- [48:08] sort of things that I think matter it's
- [48:09] like can you do a task or not versus
- [48:12] like oh yeah it's 5% better at this task
- [48:14] as you think about like the broader you
- [48:15] know uh all the kind of big questions
- [48:17] you're thinking about I'm wondering if
- [48:18] there's like you know a set of two to
- [48:20] three questions that are like most if
- [48:22] you could just like Zoom forward two
- [48:23] three years and get the answer to them
- [48:25] uh you know I assume one of will be the
- [48:27] performance of these models on the
- [48:28] 100,000 you know GPU clusters but like
- [48:30] what else is uh do you feel like are the
- [48:32] big questions that if you could flip you
- [48:34] know if you had a time machine go
- [48:35] forward to two three years uh you'd most
- [48:37] want to know the answer too I think a
- [48:39] lot of it would be like how they do
- [48:40] stuff right in the model level right um
- [48:43] because there are a lot of outstanding
- [48:44] questions on like with model development
- [48:46] how that changes Hardware development
- [48:48] like how that changes networking
- [48:49] development like how that changes data
- [48:51] center build outs do you need all the
- [48:52] data centers to be right next to each
- [48:53] other do you need them to be can they be
- [48:55] geographically spread what level of BWI
- [48:57] do you need between them what model you
- [48:59] know research stuff comes out right like
- [49:01] if you year ago you explained reasoning
- [49:03] and test time compute and how that works
- [49:05] to me I think like that would have been
- [49:07] huge right right but like I didn't know
- [49:08] that was even the question to ask right
- [49:10] like okay I knew synthetic data was a
- [49:11] thing but I didn't think it was like
- [49:12] that huge of a deal right it was a big
- [49:14] deal but not like that was more for like
- [49:15] distilling stuff right um but it's not
- [49:17] right there's a lot of other use cases
- [49:18] so it's like I don't even know what
- [49:20] question on the model side is like the
- [49:22] important one right like what really
- [49:24] gets agents to work reliably and well
- [49:26] right what what is the trick that gets
- [49:28] computer use models because anthropics
- [49:29] computer use model today sucks right but
- [49:31] like I mean it at least is something
- [49:33] right no one else has something um but
- [49:35] now that you have something it's clear
- [49:36] to see like how you can like climb up
- [49:37] and be like oh this is good so what what
- [49:39] are the tricks that people figure out
- [49:41] and how does that impact right like what
- [49:43] is the average like when you're doing
- [49:44] inference like what is the average
- [49:46] sequence length now right like is reason
- [49:48] what's like what's reasoning or what's
- [49:50] like test time compute in terms of like
- [49:52] search look like right like these are
- [49:53] questions that like I don't even know
- [49:54] what the answer would be um and I know I
- [49:57] guess I'm definitely not smart enough to
- [49:58] know what question to ask in two years
- [50:00] like besides like what is the secret
- [50:02] what is the biggest development right
- [50:03] like it's like ah with this development
- [50:05] I guess of of uh you know more compute
- [50:07] being used to create synthetic data and
- [50:08] an difference like you know that
- [50:10] obviously has massive implications on
- [50:11] the data center Hardware side it feels
- [50:13] like we might be able to get to
- [50:14] potentially more like for example right
- [50:16] like when you're doing synthetic data
- [50:18] generation you're you're verifying which
- [50:20] reasoning chains that you've generated
- [50:21] are good you're throwing away a bunch of
- [50:23] them and then you're training on them
- [50:24] and you're grading them with all these
- [50:25] reward models and and you're training on
- [50:27] them like how much of this is online
- [50:29] versus offline right can you fully
- [50:31] separate the synthetic data generation
- [50:33] from the post trining like RL with all
- [50:36] the reward models no you can't because
- [50:37] you need to update the model that's
- [50:38] generating the reasoning data constantly
- [50:41] but then like how often do you need to
- [50:42] update it can you can you do you need to
- [50:44] update it every 30 seconds right like if
- [50:47] you look at like training of llama I
- [50:48] think I think the weight the gradients
- [50:50] got updated every 15 seconds right and
- [50:52] it took a few seconds and then you're
- [50:53] training for like 10 seconds or 15
- [50:55] seconds whatever right it's like oh okay
- [50:57] you're spending this much time in
- [50:58] network versus compute like I can like
- [50:59] think about why how you need to design
- [51:01] your network now um but what what is it
- [51:03] what is that ratio what ises that mean
- [51:05] on reasoning like when you're generating
- [51:07] that data uh how much how much time does
- [51:09] it like how much time are you generating
- [51:11] data and then doing post training and
- [51:13] then before you update the way model and
- [51:15] send it back to the data generation
- [51:16] nodes to do it again and Grading their
- [51:18] outputs like this stuff like it's kind
- [51:21] of unknown to me um and probably unknown
- [51:24] to anyone besides like open ey anthropic
- [51:26] and SSI
- [51:27] like what is like actually the future
- [51:29] and what is what matters there what can
- [51:31] you like how would you design a cluster
- [51:34] to do to to accommodate that or how
- [51:36] would you design your network or can you
- [51:38] be not collocated right maybe maybe just
- [51:40] really really good fiber layouts between
- [51:42] these two data centers is good enough or
- [51:44] uh maybe they do need to be collocated
- [51:46] with super high B right like these are
- [51:47] sort of questions that like I don't know
- [51:48] right the Paradigm exists but like
- [51:51] there's so many details totally no I
- [51:53] mean I think it and it obviously has
- [51:54] implications I feel like you must get
- [51:55] asked all the time and I think you
- [51:57] you've talked about very publicly on
- [51:58] other podcasts you know I'm sure people
- [51:59] are like well Nvidia like you know paint
- [52:01] the likeliest picture where they lose or
- [52:03] you know what are like the actual uh you
- [52:04] know long-term modes here and I know
- [52:06] you've talked about obviously the
- [52:07] hardware software networking side of
- [52:08] things I'm sure you've seen a bunch of
- [52:10] Hardware startups um and folks going
- [52:11] after different parts of it what what of
- [52:13] that is like most interesting to you um
- [52:16] I think I think like there's there's a
- [52:18] couple classes right there's the old AI
- [52:19] Hardware startups right cerebrus Gro and
- [52:22] manova tens torrent right quote unquote
- [52:25] old right they've been around for a
- [52:26] while and then there's a new age of them
- [52:28] right like um there's there's like you
- [52:31] know etched and positron and madx and
- [52:35] you know there's a number of other ones
- [52:36] there's a couple that are like some
- [52:37] pretty high-profile ones that are I
- [52:39] think still under stealth so I won't say
- [52:40] anything um but there's quite a few AI
- [52:42] Hardware startups and their approaches
- [52:44] are quite different the way they think
- [52:46] is very different the what they're
- [52:47] focusing on is very different like each
- [52:49] each hardware company has a quote
- [52:51] unquote a gimmick right because like
- [52:53] you're you're you're just not going to
- [52:54] beat Nvidia by engineering better than
- [52:56] them on all axes and doing this doing
- [52:58] stuff the same way so you have to do
- [52:59] things like quite differently um
- [53:01] meanwhile Nvidia every generation is
- [53:03] like making you know large enough
- [53:05] changes to their architecture so it's
- [53:07] like not necessarily like the same but
- [53:10] you know they're making large enough
- [53:11] changes to their
- [53:12] infrastructure um and so you know the
- [53:16] question is whether or not like you know
- [53:19] what what are the like quote unquote
- [53:20] gimmicks people are doing how are they
- [53:22] solving them and or do those give them
- [53:24] like does that differentiate them enough
- [53:26] and then at the same time you have the
- [53:28] like big problem of like all the models
- [53:30] are being developed on Nvidia Hardware
- [53:32] um cognizant of what's going to happen
- [53:34] and with the with the drawbacks and
- [53:35] benefits of what Nvidia Hardware does
- [53:37] and what's the next generation one going
- [53:39] to do and so like all the model research
- [53:41] ideas like hey this research idea would
- [53:43] work but it's like if it runs really
- [53:45] inefficiently on gpus I'm not going to
- [53:47] pursue it because I don't actually care
- [53:49] about like how many operations I did I
- [53:50] care about how much time it took right
- [53:52] and if like even though that is
- [53:54] theoretically 10x less operations but it
- [53:56] 10x longer because it's just a algorithm
- [53:58] that doesn't work well on gpus and all
- [54:00] of a sudden it's like all of a sudden
- [54:02] it's like this is not worthwhile
- [54:04] pursuing yeah so the entire research
- [54:05] landscape is yeah like it it Inu like
- [54:08] nvidia's dominance influences where
- [54:09] research goes right and so like you have
- [54:11] to be different but you can't be too
- [54:13] different because then you're like you
- [54:14] know like well then models didn't
- [54:16] develop the way I I wanted them to and
- [54:18] now I'm so right like could you have a
- [54:20] model that's like extremely you know far
- [54:23] fewer parameters but needs way more
- [54:25] bandwidth and you know could run all
- [54:27] entirely on chip potentially but like
- [54:29] how are you going to train that model
- [54:30] right and it's like well I'm going to
- [54:31] train it with Nvidia gpus which doesn't
- [54:33] make sense because I can do something
- [54:34] better and how am I going to deploy it
- [54:35] well I'd rather deploy have it be able
- [54:37] to be deployed on all the gpus I've
- [54:38] already bought right um so it's like you
- [54:41] know you've got the Chicken and the Egg
- [54:42] kind of problem too um I think like some
- [54:45] people are explicitly targeting like
- [54:47] inference and like training and like
- [54:49] that'll be interesting because um when
- [54:52] you talk to like you know Nvidia you
- [54:55] talk to the chip teams at various
- [54:57] hyperscalers like the TPU or tranium or
- [55:00] you know Etc right like these various
- [55:02] like one of the labs has an AI chip team
- [55:04] like all these companies all these
- [55:05] people believe that training chips are
- [55:07] inference chips which is very funny um
- [55:10] and I think it's because like they they
- [55:11] see the flexibility they see like the
- [55:12] workload changing it's like so like does
- [55:14] an inference chip like what does it
- [55:16] materially mean because there are a few
- [55:17] of those in works right um by the time
- [55:21] you get your chip out maybe you
- [55:22] projected a 5x cost difference or 10x
- [55:24] cost difference versus Hopper they
- [55:26] capture it but now like Blackwell
- [55:28] nvidia's pitching 10 to 15x Improvement
- [55:30] in cost it's like well you know they're
- [55:31] massaging the numbers marketing actually
- [55:33] I think they said 30X in their GTC but
- [55:35] like you know massaging the numbers 10x
- [55:37] 15x even is like probably could be like
- [55:39] reasonable or not um depends on the
- [55:41] workload standard chat inference it's
- [55:43] probably not that but for like uh for
- [55:46] mediumsized and small models but for
- [55:47] like really really large models or
- [55:49] reasoning models it's actually I do
- [55:50] think it's going to be like 105x um so
- [55:52] it's like oh wow okay so you've captured
- [55:54] you've like narrowed the Delta massively
- [55:56] right
- [55:56] um so that's like a big uh that's a big
- [56:00] like question also is like so so what is
- [56:03] interesting is like yeah a lot of these
- [56:04] companies are taking approaches that are
- [56:06] super cool right like and the three that
- [56:09] I mentioned the new age ones like madx
- [56:11] positron and etched are taking
- [56:13] approaches that are super cool right and
- [56:15] could work out uh or models could
- [56:17] develop in a way that isn't good for
- [56:19] them right um so that's that's the big
- [56:22] question right I think you've called
- [56:23] tranium like the Amazon basics of chips
- [56:25] and so uh you're obviously the hardware
- [56:27] Guru but like one thing I've just been
- [56:29] curious about is like to what extent is
- [56:30] anthropics use of them like a sacrifice
- [56:32] versus hey it doesn't really matter um
- [56:35] yes it's it's the Amazon Basics TPU
- [56:37] because like its topology of networking
- [56:39] looks exactly like a TPU and like a lot
- [56:41] of different design choices they have
- [56:42] were like this is just like TPU stuff
- [56:45] right um obviously they're doing a lot
- [56:47] of their own independent stuff there's a
- [56:48] lot of unique things um that they've
- [56:50] implemented like stochastic rounding and
- [56:53] all these other things but like it's
- [56:54] like you know these are unique things
- [56:55] but um
- [56:56] it is the Amazon Basics TPU right from
- [56:59] Google right Google TPU um and so like
- [57:02] because it's like worse but it's cheaper
- [57:04] and yeah like what now anthropic like
- [57:06] what is like they barely used tranium
- [57:08] today right they barely used tranium in
- [57:09] inferentia uh they've primarily used
- [57:11] hopper Hopper at Google hopper at Amazon
- [57:14] um they did use some TPU at Google of
- [57:15] course um but now this year like it's
- [57:18] like very clear they've bet all eggs
- [57:21] into the basket of trainum um how much
- [57:23] of this is forced right like you know
- [57:25] how do I do did I need to do this to get
- [57:27] Amazon to invest in me and like make me
- [57:29] their partner uh partially yeah Absol
- [57:33] absolutely right but did I do this out
- [57:34] of my own volition because it actually
- [57:36] made sense I think partially yeah
- [57:38] because like the Amazon Basics TPU gives
- [57:40] you on some metrics it gives you the
- [57:43] best uh performance per dollar right and
- [57:45] those metrics are like memory bandwidth
- [57:47] and memory capacity per dollar it
- [57:49] actually has better than any other chip
- [57:50] in the market including tpus or gpus
- [57:53] right because like some of the like
- [57:54] supply chain choices that Amazon CHS
- [57:56] right um and and things around that
- [57:59] right so it's like
- [58:01] what you know I think I I don't think
- [58:03] it's as simple as like anthropic was
- [58:05] forced to I think I think like they had
- [58:07] to weigh the benefits right they're like
- [58:08] we could partner really closely with
- [58:10] Amazon we could raise more money from
- [58:11] them and do this or raise a little less
- [58:13] money and and like try and get gpus from
- [58:15] them right it's like they had to partner
- [58:18] with someone to do the capex of course
- [58:19] right because the whole like rental
- [58:21] versus like capex of like the cluster um
- [58:23] so they definitely had to deal with that
- [58:24] and then they had to have the
- [58:25] distribution Channel of Amazon right
- [58:27] they needed those things um but like I'm
- [58:30] sure they could have struck a smaller
- [58:31] deal with Amazon and gotten gpus if they
- [58:33] really wanted to now was that better or
- [58:35] was it better to like take more money go
- [58:37] tranium go all in um you know do like
- [58:41] try and emphasize your future model
- [58:43] architecture on the benefits that
- [58:44] trainum offers you versus gpus because
- [58:46] there are some right uh majority know
- [58:48] they're worse right just straight up
- [58:50] worse but some benefits exist so that's
- [58:52] the sort of question that uh um you it's
- [58:55] a good question
- [58:56] I I I think mostly like it's like hand
- [58:58] ringing and and a bit of like yeah we
- [59:00] can engineer our way out of this does it
- [59:02] make sense for open AI to like build its
- [59:03] own ship I think it does right I mean
- [59:05] like it doesn't make sense if you think
- [59:08] like you know their growth is like
- [59:10] linear like you know it's going to go
- [59:12] from like you know you know like what do
- [59:13] you think open ey's Revenue this year is
- [59:14] going to be if it's less than1 billion
- [59:16] and the year after that less than15
- [59:17] billion should not make a chip right but
- [59:21] like if you think their revenue this
- [59:22] year is going to be north of $10 billion
- [59:24] by by $10 billion I mean run rate um cuz
- [59:28] we're we're we're at a BC right we don't
- [59:30] we don't think about things in uh no run
- [59:31] rate is more important I think it's just
- [59:32] simply more important right whatever the
- [59:34] higher one is we'll take yeah exactly
- [59:36] exactly uh I mean it's like more
- [59:37] indicative of like what the current
- [59:38] state of the business is right um so
- [59:40] like you know if they go like well north
- [59:43] of $10 billion on run rate and the year
- [59:44] after that what are they at like north
- [59:46] of 20 like you know you know the costs
- [59:49] start to scale rapidly and like it makes
- [59:50] a ton of sense to make their own chip
- [59:52] right um and so like you know just
- [59:55] because they have the chip team doesn't
- [59:56] mean that like they're not going to you
- [59:58] know they're not like collaborating
- [60:00] super closely with Nvidia and working
- [60:02] with them on New architecture right like
- [60:03] there's a wall in in open AI like the
- [60:06] people working on the chip do not get to
- [60:08] work with Nvidia on what their next
- [60:09] Generation architecture is right the
- [60:11] Nvidia is no stranger to this like
- [60:13] coopertition I mean all of it's major
- [60:14] customers exactly exactly like meta's
- [60:16] doing it Google's doing it Amazon's
- [60:17] doing it right it's like they're used to
- [60:19] it and their like attitude is very much
- [60:21] like good luck we're going to crush you
- [60:24] right like we're just better right and
- [60:25] like so far that's worked right um and
- [60:29] and like I think their attitude to open
- [60:30] AI would be the same um and open ai's
- [60:33] attitude is always like well you know
- [60:35] how much you know it's the same as
- [60:36] hypers SKS right like well if we spend
- [60:38] like you know few hundred million
- [60:39] dollars billion dollars a year on this
- [60:42] um it gives us a call option also we can
- [60:43] always just use it as a negotiating chip
- [60:45] right like if if you know I spend a
- [60:48] billion dollars on my own chips in 26 27
- [60:51] right uh but then you know the
- [60:54] alternative is you know and and and and
- [60:57] I'm not really deploying them in huge
- [60:58] scales I'm mostly still buying Nvidia
- [61:00] chips but if I got a 10% discount on
- [61:02] Nvidia chips it paid for itself yeah and
- [61:03] it's like did does does tranium help
- [61:06] Amazon get a 10% discount or a 5%
- [61:08] discount on $30 billion of GPU purchases
- [61:11] like okay great it's like worth it right
- [61:13] and it doesn't even like you could like
- [61:15] just not do anything with it and it
- [61:16] would be worth it right like obviously
- [61:17] it's a game of chicken like Jensen like
- [61:19] knows how much you're making and all
- [61:20] these things but yeah I think I think
- [61:22] that's the big um question and I think I
- [61:25] think in from my perspective it
- [61:26] absolutely makes sense even if it's not
- [61:28] successful yeah um to do this and if
- [61:31] it's successful it's humous there's this
- [61:33] whole crop of companies too that that
- [61:34] popped up like you know the fireworks
- [61:36] and togethers of the world um you know
- [61:38] that are they're obviously just you know
- [61:39] focused on inference optimization today
- [61:41] and places to run a bunch of models what
- [61:43] what happens to that market long term I
- [61:45] think that um Enterprise AI uh is is
- [61:50] actually got like really decent legs in
- [61:53] some regards um
- [61:56] because of all again like all the unique
- [61:58] data that enterprises have and uh unique
- [62:00] use cases and you know now that you can
- [62:02] you Enterprises like to think their data
- [62:04] is good but now like you most of the
- [62:06] times it's pretty dirty and garbage
- [62:08] right like just to be clear uh but now
- [62:10] like with the synthetic data pipelines
- [62:11] reasoning all this sort of stuff people
- [62:12] can actually figure out how to generate
- [62:14] a bunch of data that's specific to a
- [62:16] business and verify whether it's good or
- [62:18] not and then like they can actually
- [62:19] improve the models and like they can do
- [62:21] reasoning on a much smaller scale for
- [62:24] Enterprises I think like this works
- [62:25] hugely right this is massively good
- [62:27] right now obviously like fireworks and
- [62:29] together I think are like there's like
- [62:31] 20 inference API providers out there
- [62:33] that are just taking open source models
- [62:35] and serving them um you obviously name
- [62:37] the best two in class right two
- [62:38] companies that like build their own
- [62:40] inference engine uh are very efficient
- [62:43] much more efficient than like VM or
- [62:45] tensor RTM like all of these like sort
- [62:47] of things um have good go to market all
- [62:49] these sort of things like you know these
- [62:50] companies are good I think they will be
- [62:52] good because they're going to continue
- [62:54] to be a um you know meta is going to
- [62:56] open source models B chin will continue
- [62:58] open source models C Enterprises uh will
- [63:02] be able to work with people to make um
- [63:05] better you know reasoning type models
- [63:06] right now like together helps people
- [63:08] train models right um and so does data
- [63:10] breaks and like sort of like all these
- [63:12] companies like help train models and
- [63:13] there's many other like sort of services
- [63:15] or like people can partner with a
- [63:17] startup to help them make a I feel like
- [63:18] the whole yeah the whole Mosaic pitch
- [63:19] was like you know train your own models
- [63:21] that went out of fashion for a bit
- [63:22] because the general purpose models were
- [63:23] just getting better at everything way
- [63:25] faster than like Bloomberg GPT was but
- [63:27] now with these reasoning chains and then
- [63:28] need to kind of verify this he actually
- [63:29] might be back in that world yeah yeah I
- [63:31] think I think like Mosaic really lost
- [63:33] its kind of and data Works kind of lost
- [63:34] its footing for a bit um it'll be really
- [63:36] interesting to see if they can get RL
- [63:38] and reasoning to work because I think
- [63:40] that like you know if like and I'm sure
- [63:42] I'm sure Alia D BRS kind of knows this
- [63:43] is like you know this is the thing that
- [63:45] like would make training for your
- [63:48] customers make sense again and maybe not
- [63:49] pre-training right because that's what
- [63:51] Mosaic was doing Mosaic was doing really
- [63:53] really good pre-training you know they
- [63:54] had the best model in the world twice
- [63:56] two different instances open source
- [63:57] model for for short periods of time but
- [63:59] they had the best model in the world for
- [64:00] short periods of time twice like once
- [64:02] with the m MPT and then once with dbrx
- [64:05] um but the you know like they've kind of
- [64:09] fallen off because it's like well I
- [64:10] can't really compete and spend the capex
- [64:11] that meta is right um or or you know
- [64:14] even like Alibaba right um so but now
- [64:17] again right it's like I take the open
- [64:19] source pre-trained model I generate all
- [64:21] these pipelines for reasoning synthetic
- [64:22] data and my customers data again like
- [64:26] you know it kind of sucks but like you
- [64:27] know now I can like verify it in some
- [64:29] way figure out the recipe and like
- [64:31] actually apply it to everyone's business
- [64:32] use cases I think that is that is like
- [64:35] potentially and and and these people
- [64:36] need to serve models right so it's not
- [64:37] just like data bricks Mosaic ml that's
- [64:39] going to do this but like everyone's
- [64:40] going to do this there going to be
- [64:41] startups that do this as a service um
- [64:43] like uh like adaptive ml like they're
- [64:46] going to do this as a service and
- [64:47] they've actually been doing it as a
- [64:48] service um for like a year now um which
- [64:50] is like really cool like these these
- [64:52] people can partner with Enterprises they
- [64:54] can do white glove services can do
- [64:56] consulting services like whatever it is
- [64:57] help them build models that like are
- [65:00] uniquely uh you know unique use cases
- [65:03] for this stuff right um and then and
- [65:05] then like those will need to be deployed
- [65:07] right or companies will want to do it on
- [65:08] their own right there's always going to
- [65:10] be and there's always going to be like
- [65:11] security stuff like so I think I think
- [65:13] like together and and fireworks will be
- [65:16] like the partner of choice for inference
- [65:18] of these models right even if it's not
- [65:20] necessarily on their gpus it's like let
- [65:22] let me you know do a virtual private
- [65:24] Cloud on Amazon with your software uh
- [65:27] running the model right because you've
- [65:28] built all these like variable batching
- [65:30] and all these like various things and
- [65:31] it's way more efficient right than like
- [65:33] the public software I'm G to ask like a
- [65:34] very basic question about cor weave uh
- [65:36] just uh for for my own edification um
- [65:39] and that's just like what made them so
- [65:41] successful I mean from the outside
- [65:43] sometimes it feels like there was this
- [65:45] decision from Jensen to allocate gpus
- [65:46] among a bunch of players they were kind
- [65:48] of rewarded in that um and I think it
- [65:51] kind of goes to and you're an expert on
- [65:52] this like the extent to which some of
- [65:54] these mini clouds can differentiate
- [65:55] Beyond like just access to the gpus
- [65:57] which it felt like in the first bit was
- [65:58] was one of the big things so I think I
- [66:00] think like part of it is
- [66:03] um I think I think it's there's three
- [66:05] factors right one is the allocation bit
- [66:07] right like Jensen is no idiot his
- [66:09] customers are all trying to build chips
- [66:11] um they also rent most of the gips to
- [66:13] other people you want to have more
- [66:15] competition right so let me spark
- [66:17] competition let me do a small investment
- [66:18] in like four different clouds I think
- [66:19] they've invested in four different
- [66:20] clouds so far um and and they haven't
- [66:22] been large Investments they've been
- [66:23] pretty small um but like sort of giv
- [66:26] other people confidence like oh yeah
- [66:27] they're going to get allocation right
- [66:28] and then those gpus are allocated there
- [66:30] world's so tight in gpus they're able to
- [66:31] rent them for a lot of money make money
- [66:33] and get the engine going on a on a on a
- [66:35] cloud right so cor weave now has like
- [66:37] 200k plus gpus right like a lot of gpus
- [66:39] right they're doing like you know
- [66:41] billions of dollars of Revenue right
- [66:43] like it's not not mundane business now
- [66:45] right um and so and you know they're
- [66:48] worth like whatever like 20 billion
- [66:49] dollars or something like I think on the
- [66:51] last round whatever right and and
- [66:52] they're going to go public this year
- [66:53] probably at like more than that right
- [66:54] well more than that it's like this is a
- [66:56] real business now right um how do they
- [66:59] differentiate right like one is yeah
- [67:00] they still continue to have access
- [67:02] newest generation they're still going to
- [67:03] have access they're still gonna you know
- [67:05] maybe Google gets for every you know 10
- [67:08] that Microsoft gets cor maybe in the
- [67:10] beginning can get three now at some
- [67:12] point you know the production capacity
- [67:13] is not 13 the production capacity is 100
- [67:16] and you know again I'm just pretending
- [67:17] there's only two people now you know
- [67:18] Microsoft gets 90 and cor only gets you
- [67:21] know three right so now it's you know 93
- [67:23] right whatever right like you know like
- [67:25] the this but like at the beginning is of
- [67:27] of a new gpu's useful life you know it
- [67:29] is worth the most because at that time
- [67:31] you can rent it for way more and then
- [67:32] over time it Narrows as more and more
- [67:35] competitors enter the market and there's
- [67:36] more and more of them um that's one two
- [67:39] is the speed of build outs right
- [67:41] like uh Microsoft's data center
- [67:44] organization and rack and all these
- [67:46] things like server organization same
- [67:47] with Amazon um they're custom there are
- [67:50] like tens of thousands of people they've
- [67:52] always been used to modifying servers
- [67:54] customizing them to squeeze every pen
- [67:55] out right um and and and in the era of
- [67:58] like GPU Compu it's like well what if I
- [68:00] just do what Jensen says right like I
- [68:02] build you know I might make some tweaks
- [68:03] I might put a little bit less memory I
- [68:05] might change the storage around I might
- [68:06] change the network a little bit slightly
- [68:07] but like in general what if I just take
- [68:08] the reference design and like modify it
- [68:10] a little bit um now I am paying a little
- [68:13] bit more right not you know that that
- [68:15] but then I have the like time to market
- [68:17] right like the moment the GPU is being
- [68:19] produced by tsmc it's packaged it can go
- [68:21] to the server maker reference design is
- [68:23] ready to ship to me right whereas like
- [68:25] Amazon you know especially Amazon their
- [68:27] Blackwell rollouts are much later than
- [68:30] many of the other uh players because
- [68:32] they have to do all this customization
- [68:33] yeah right um and and then like lastly
- [68:36] like sort of there's like um I think I
- [68:38] think the other aspect is Data Center
- [68:40] capacity right we talked about this ESG
- [68:41] stuff corewave gives like they're very
- [68:44] they've been very aggressive always on
- [68:45] like renting gpus getting credit at like
- [68:48] what what at the time seem like crazy
- [68:50] terms like like double digit loans like
- [68:52] what the flip to deploy gpus was the
- [68:54] right decision right now they're they're
- [68:56] established and so their loans are
- [68:57] single digits again right like you know
- [68:58] higher higher single digits but it's
- [69:00] like um getting data centers is very
- [69:03] hard and they've been very very creative
- [69:04] initially they were just like getting
- [69:06] anything and everything um that capacity
- [69:08] all dried out and the hyperscalers woke
- [69:10] up and they went to try and get
- [69:11] everything and everything but then Corby
- [69:13] started going to crypto companies right
- [69:15] like um you know they went to a couple
- [69:17] different crypto companies um offered to
- [69:19] buy one of them out offered to you know
- [69:21] and then eventually like just like
- [69:22] struck a deal where they're retrofitting
- [69:23] all their data centers like yeah throw
- [69:25] crypto crap away I'm going to convert
- [69:26] your your thing into a data center right
- [69:29] and one of these crypto data centers has
- [69:30] a like a 200 megawatt uh natural gas
- [69:33] plant in the middle of like seven
- [69:36] buildings right and each of these
- [69:37] buildings is a data center so there they
- [69:39] simultaneous and it's like a natural gas
- [69:41] plant it's like like meta what they're
- [69:42] doing is like okay the gas plant is like
- [69:45] 30 miles away and I I I struck a deal
- [69:47] with this solar power company that's
- [69:49] putting you know tons of solar panels
- [69:51] like you know in a similar distance away
- [69:53] but I'm not necessarily consuming as so
- [69:55] it's not clean right um in the case of
- [69:58] like cor it's like no no no I don't care
- [70:00] right like the power is here like right
- [70:03] on site I'm converting this to crypto
- [70:04] data these crypto data centers to real
- [70:06] data centers there's a metric called pee
- [70:08] power usage Effectiveness is basically
- [70:10] how much power are you pulling uh from
- [70:12] like the grid power generation versus
- [70:15] how much are the chips consuming right
- [70:17] and so or like the servers right and so
- [70:19] like the ratio that like hyperscalers
- [70:21] try to design to is like 1.1 right only
- [70:24] 10% of the power is lost in transmission
- [70:26] and cooling right but like this crypto
- [70:28] data center once they convert it because
- [70:30] it's like a really like really dumb
- [70:32] design because the crypto people didn't
- [70:33] know how to build the data center
- [70:34] properly right um even though it's being
- [70:35] retrofitted it's still going to be like
- [70:37] 1.4 so it's like you go from 1.1 to 1.4
- [70:40] it's like oh if it's consuming 200
- [70:42] megawatts um what was 20 megawatts of
- [70:46] power being burned uh on Cooling and and
- [70:48] electrical transmission and and
- [70:50] conversion now is like 50 right 60 70
- [70:54] right and it's like okay this is a lot
- [70:56] of inefficiency but it's like screw it
- [70:58] we need gpus now it was worth it I iess
- [71:00] yeah the inefficiency both on the
- [71:01] financing side on the uh on the power
- [71:03] conversion side and then and then they
- [71:04] do like certain things like really
- [71:05] efficiently like they're just a small
- [71:06] organization that's well-run yeah right
- [71:09] and their
- [71:10] software there's their Cloud software
- [71:12] for GPU rental is literally better than
- [71:14] Amazon's and Google's yeah um it's it's
- [71:17] actually hilarious we'll have a piece
- [71:18] about what makes it better um just the
- [71:20] way they do their manage services the
- [71:21] way they manage their Network um the way
- [71:24] they do storage like there's a number of
- [71:26] things here that are just like
- [71:27] objectively better with cor weef um and
- [71:29] it's like what um how did you guys build
- [71:34] lose to that game but it's like it's
- [71:35] like well you have this Legacy and you
- [71:37] know innovator dilemma and you don't
- [71:38] build a brand new thing that's purpose
- [71:40] built you like morph and you have all
- [71:42] these like weird requirements for random
- [71:44] customers like random defense company
- [71:46] you also need to make sure your gpus are
- [71:47] rentable to them or like you know and
- [71:49] it's like cor is like well let's like
- [71:51] they're starting the problem a new and
- [71:53] they have a brand new Team Clean Slate
- [71:54] really good engineer and they're
- [71:55] building what needs to be built purpose
- [71:57] built for this business right and they
- [72:00] don't have like a team of like 2,000
- [72:02] people who work on storage architecture
- [72:04] that used that used to be primarily
- [72:06] targeted for thesea this use case and
- [72:08] accelerators are different right like
- [72:09] what you need an AI not exactly
- [72:11] analogous it's similar right like you
- [72:13] know but they're trying to morph this
- [72:14] massive code base to that rather than
- [72:16] like ground up build something new right
- [72:18] and it's like this is the the case for
- [72:20] every startup in the AI world yeah like
- [72:22] I think I think like there is innovators
- [72:23] dilemma with the big companies yeah what
- [72:25] are like I mean you obviously must get
- [72:27] see all sort kind of interesting
- [72:28] investment plays on this massive
- [72:30] Hardware build that going on there's the
- [72:31] obvious stuff there's data centers
- [72:32] liquid cooling any like second or third
- [72:34] order effects you've seen where you're
- [72:35] like that's a clever way to play the uh
- [72:37] the massive data center buildout yeah I
- [72:40] think like I mean like some of the stuff
- [72:41] is like uh yesterday I had like an
- [72:44] hourong discussion with a guy who's
- [72:46] building a data center in Armenia
- [72:48] because there's a nuclear power plant
- [72:49] there it's like great this is like
- [72:51] awesome and he's like doing a venture
- [72:52] fund he he has a venture Fund in New
- [72:54] York but he's kind of just like screw it
- [72:57] I'm going to work on this pretty much
- [72:59] it's like oh this is awesome right like
- [73:00] it's like you know there's silly stuff
- [73:01] like that not silly like it could work
- [73:03] right um although the regulation's kind
- [73:04] of screw in I talk about that um but
- [73:06] like I think like a lot of like
- [73:08] interesting plays around networking and
- [73:10] Optics right there's a lot of stuff
- [73:12] going on in networking and Optics which
- [73:13] is like a big bottleneck um especially
- [73:16] as we continue to scale the density of
- [73:18] gpus um and the uh you know the the
- [73:22] amount of data that needs to be
- [73:23] communicated between gpus as model model
- [73:25] get a larger and B the context length
- [73:27] get longer and longer because of
- [73:28] reasoning um you know this is sort of
- [73:31] like and search like all these things
- [73:32] require like more interconnected gpus um
- [73:35] I would say that there's a lot of
- [73:37] interesting stuff around like
- [73:39] Transformers right I told you they're
- [73:40] sold out for like four years well like
- [73:42] there's all sorts of interesting
- [73:43] startups working on like solid state
- [73:44] Transformers and like partially solid
- [73:46] state Transformers and like all sorts of
- [73:48] like Hardware stuff that's like sexy
- [73:50] right like there's like there's like
- [73:51] funny stuff there's like cool companies
- [73:53] on like carbon sequestration because yes
- [73:55] meta and Microsoft meta especially and X
- [73:57] have like said like screw the
- [73:58] environment right like not screw the
- [73:59] environment but like we're going to
- [74:00] build AI as fast as we can you know like
- [74:03] they're at some point going to be like
- [74:04] yeah let's be greaten again right and
- [74:06] it's like carbon sequestration stuff is
- [74:07] like in in a wrapped up in a data center
- [74:09] play is like actually pretty interesting
- [74:11] right it's like there's all sorts of
- [74:13] like you know like interesting stuff
- [74:15] around you know storage what companies
- [74:17] are doing there uh because video models
- [74:20] are going to require a lot of like
- [74:21] interesting work there right like it's
- [74:23] like you know purpose-built solutions
- [74:24] for the plethora and sea of innovation
- [74:26] that's happening um and targeting all
- [74:28] these things I think if you look at
- [74:29] every layer of the stack there's more
- [74:31] Innovation happening today um you know
- [74:34] not just in each stack but also like
- [74:36] bridging multiple layers of the stack uh
- [74:38] to like come up with like a huge
- [74:40] Improvement um some of that is happening
- [74:41] at the big companies some of happening
- [74:43] at startups I think you know some of
- [74:44] these startups will get acquired by
- [74:45] bigger companies some will actually like
- [74:46] find a product Market fit right like um
- [74:48] I think some of them well license
- [74:50] technology like whatever it is I think
- [74:52] there's a lot of like Hardware
- [74:53] technologies that are interesting and
- [74:54] then I think the really like fun area is
- [74:58] software infra yeah right so software
- [75:00] infrastructure is like also getting very
- [75:02] diverse um because not everyone can just
- [75:06] build their own stack I think that where
- [75:08] where people are like very in tune with
- [75:10] the hardware understand how to Mak
- [75:12] things run fast um also in tune with
- [75:14] what's going on with models um and like
- [75:16] bringing you know you bring your data
- [75:17] and all your capabilities and I bring
- [75:19] you something that lets you build and
- [75:21] serve your actual use case right so this
- [75:23] is software infra is not you know was
- [75:25] not always sexy it was always like you
- [75:27] know SAS was more sexy or like you know
- [75:29] like um and or like you know some sort
- [75:32] of like I mean I guess software infra is
- [75:35] to some extent uh SAS but not really um
- [75:38] I think these are the sort of the
- [75:39] businesses where there's a lot of
- [75:40] innovation happening as well infr layer
- [75:41] has just been so hard to invest in
- [75:42] because the models change so quickly
- [75:44] that any kind of like scaffolding or
- [75:45] things you're building for this current
- [75:46] generation of models you're like is that
- [75:48] relevant and in six this is this is why
- [75:50] like some companies have like you know
- [75:52] bet on things that were like further out
- [75:54] right like like like I mentioned the
- [75:55] Adaptive right like they were they were
- [75:57] working on pre they like it's like a few
- [75:59] french guys who moved to UAE and they
- [76:00] built the Falcon model in UAE right and
- [76:02] then they like moved to back to France
- [76:04] and now they're in New York right but
- [76:05] like while they were building the Falcon
- [76:06] model for UAE they were doing
- [76:07] pre-training they did 180 billion
- [76:10] parameter model to chill optimal it's
- [76:11] like fun right it was not like it was a
- [76:13] good model when it got released it was
- [76:14] just like you know whatever right like
- [76:15] llama just came out too right it was
- [76:17] like it was like really good but it was
- [76:18] like yeah they're like immediate like
- [76:19] pre trining doesn't matter right it's
- [76:20] like we're gonna work on synthetic data
- [76:22] and reasoning it's like what okay sure
- [76:25] and then like for for a while I was like
- [76:27] what are you guys doing like I don't
- [76:28] know that and then like all of a sudden
- [76:29] I like oh wait wait this is right like
- [76:30] so you have to like you saw something
- [76:32] yeah it's like it's like there's a lot
- [76:33] of companies that are like doing
- [76:35] something that may not matter today and
- [76:38] you just have to like doesn't seem to be
- [76:40] the focus the popular thing today but
- [76:42] could be and will be in the future 100%
- [76:45] what about what do you think of like
- [76:46] these AI Hardware efforts like folks
- [76:47] that are using you know AI for chip
- [76:49] design or you know circuit board layout
- [76:50] or some of these other things I think
- [76:52] it's really interesting that YC all of a
- [76:54] sudden like decided to invest in like 12
- [76:56] different AI for chip design companies
- [76:58] all at once uh in in the last few
- [77:00] batches um a couple of them are cool I
- [77:02] actually even invested in one of them
- [77:03] myself personally just to be clear I'm
- [77:05] not hating on the idea it's just like
- [77:07] very interesting that this happened um
- [77:10] but like you know AI chip design is very
- [77:12] expensive right um it's very difficult
- [77:15] the number of Engineers working on chip
- [77:17] design has not grown that meaningfully
- [77:19] over the last two decades right in the
- [77:21] in the US like this is the start of like
- [77:22] every AI app pitch it's like whatever
- [77:24] insert your profession here is uh
- [77:26] stagnating in growth right but but the
- [77:29] output has been dramatically improving
- [77:31] right and that's because of Eda software
- [77:32] right electronic design assistant and
- [77:34] Eda software as much as you can hate on
- [77:36] it as much as you can say it's like old
- [77:37] shitty software it's actually really
- [77:39] awesome because it's like the the
- [77:41] productivity gains that chip designers
- [77:42] are getting year on-ear are meaningfully
- [77:44] large right and that's pretty AI Now Now
- [77:47] Cadence and synopsis and semans are all
- [77:49] U Mentor Graphics right are all
- [77:51] investing in AI for chip design there's
- [77:52] also a lot of companies doing it right
- [77:54] uh Nvidia has written multiple papers
- [77:55] about their internal tooling um and
- [77:57] they've hidden a lot of it too they
- [77:58] haven't said a lot about um Google same
- [78:01] way right this is absolutely going to be
- [78:03] huge now is AI going to chip design chip
- [78:05] right away no but is it going to be a
- [78:06] force multiplier for a very like in
- [78:09] demand profession like and yeah like and
- [78:12] and like the other thing is like today
- [78:14] like a lot of workloads just have to use
- [78:16] like like CPUs and then gpus are the
- [78:18] general purpose parallel Computing
- [78:20] platform right now obviously they're
- [78:21] generally making more and more
- [78:23] enhancements for certain types of models
- [78:25] but like gpus are not good at running
- [78:26] CNN yeah right like and this is a
- [78:28] conscious design decision by Nvidia
- [78:30] right like they're okay they're good but
- [78:32] they're not like amazing at running
- [78:34] CNN's like they are at Transformers
- [78:35] right and and this I believe is like a
- [78:37] conscious design decision um what you
- [78:40] know how do you go from like CPU which
- [78:42] is the catch all general purpose GPU to
- [78:44] like general purpose for parallel
- [78:46] processing to like what is the next step
- [78:48] and like and Nvidia is like branching
- [78:49] their GP architecture out they have
- [78:51] different like architectures for like
- [78:53] Automotive versus uh gaming versus um
- [78:56] yeah um you know pure data center AI so
- [78:58] they're not like just like sitting flat
- [79:00] footed but it's like how can we
- [79:01] proliferate architecture to Target use
- [79:03] cases better um and and today for for it
- [79:06] to make sense for you to design a chip
- [79:08] for a tam that Tam needs to be billiant
- [79:10] if you can bring down the cost right so
- [79:12] like Google made a YouTube chip right
- [79:14] because that was a billion dollar
- [79:15] multi-billion dollar Tam for them alone
- [79:17] internally that's when Asic made sense
- [79:19] but when when chip design costs can
- [79:20] drive down and it's like AI for chip
- [79:22] design will do this right like I just
- [79:24] think it won't be like you know it's not
- [79:26] going to go from Z to one it's going to
- [79:27] be like a force multiplier and I think
- [79:29] it's it's one of the areas I'm super
- [79:30] super excited about whether it be floor
- [79:32] planning or or RTL generation or many
- [79:35] other things like verification
- [79:36] verification is like half the spend of a
- [79:38] chip design it's like quite funny as
- [79:40] like more than like half the cost is
- [79:41] making sure what you designed actually
- [79:43] works I was like okay interesting um
- [79:45] like there's tons of like stuff there um
- [79:48] that I think um could be done and yeah
- [79:51] it's like I'm very excited about that
- [79:53] space actually I feel like this has been
- [79:54] uh a fascinating and really wide ranging
- [79:56] conversation we always like to end with
- [79:57] a standard set of quickfire questions um
- [80:00] and so maybe to start uh what's one
- [80:02] thing that's overhyped and one thing
- [80:03] that's underhyped in the AI world today
- [80:05] overhyped
- [80:06] rag um underhyped various other forms of
- [80:10] like semantic search um and like
- [80:13] retrieval um there's some interesting
- [80:16] papers that came out recently yeah Will
- [80:17] model progress uh this year in 25 be
- [80:20] more or less are the same as in 24 more
- [80:22] what's your weirdest prediction on like
- [80:24] the implications for all this AI
- [80:25] progress on the future I think you know
- [80:27] there's a lot of like worries that like
- [80:29] there's going to be huge inequality um
- [80:32] I'm actually like on the flip side I
- [80:34] think that
- [80:35] like um blueco collar type jobs that
- [80:38] were generally hated on were like are
- [80:40] going to do well until robotics comes
- [80:42] which I think is pretty soon but uh you
- [80:43] know um so for that but like no but like
- [80:46] I think that like generally the poorest
- [80:47] people in the world will also improve in
- [80:50] quality of living massively right and
- [80:53] it's not going to be like a half versus
- [80:54] have knots Ultra Elite versus not I
- [80:56] don't think that's going to be the
- [80:57] future yeah I mean I guess you better
- [80:59] hope the uh inference cost on these
- [81:00] reasoning models comes down yeah I I
- [81:02] like that the what is what is opening
- [81:04] eyes thing intelligence per uh dollar
- [81:07] like maximizing intelligence per dollar
- [81:08] and it's like well right now it's really
- [81:11] freaking expensive right yeah and I
- [81:13] expect I expect the models to get even
- [81:14] more expensive right like a query from
- [81:16] like gp5 05 or whatever right like
- [81:19] reasoning version of GPD 5 is going to
- [81:21] be like dozens of dollars if not
- [81:23] hundreds of dollars right but it's the
- [81:25] work it puts out is going to be crazy do
- [81:27] you have a go-to query you use when like
- [81:28] a new model comes out test it out um
- [81:30] it's funny I actually asked them about
- [81:31] semiconductor manufacturing because uh I
- [81:34] know the training set quite well I've
- [81:35] read a lot of the papers um and and then
- [81:38] I see if it actually understands it and
- [81:39] a lot of times models get it wrong um in
- [81:42] today even to this day Claude is the
- [81:44] only model that you can like once you
- [81:46] create enough can get the patterning
- [81:48] stack for lithography like somewhat
- [81:50] accurate and that's just because no one
- [81:52] publishes on it so it's like it has to
- [81:53] like understand and infer what people
- [81:55] are actually doing which I thought was
- [81:57] very
- [81:58] interesting we' talked about a bunch of
- [82:00] different parts of the AI startup world
- [82:02] but any like spaces within the AI
- [82:03] startup world we haven't talked about
- [82:04] that you find particularly interesting
- [82:05] or exciting I think there's a lot of
- [82:07] cool stuff happening on the distributed
- [82:08] training side right like with noose and
- [82:10] with uh um you know although I'm not you
- [82:12] know like you know there still needs to
- [82:14] be a lot more to prove what they did as
- [82:15] like good and real but like very
- [82:17] exciting and then Prime intellect same
- [82:18] thing um and yeah they also like you
- [82:21] know like are doing really cool stuff I
- [82:22] think distributed uh training and in is
- [82:24] like going to be really cool um I think
- [82:27] that
- [82:29] um I think that a lot of these like
- [82:31] multi-agent reasoning startups that
- [82:34] started a while ago um but have actually
- [82:37] been focused on reasoning like like like
- [82:39] synth labs and and adaptive and like
- [82:41] people like that rather than like you
- [82:42] know agents and pivoting to reasoning
- [82:44] because everyone's doing a reasoning
- [82:44] startup now right like uh I think that's
- [82:46] like a really cool area
- [82:49] um and I really just like people who in
- [82:52] startups that are like have been
- [82:53] singularly focused like forever on the
- [82:55] same thing and like they're like and
- [82:57] they're right it's just like you don't
- [82:58] know when they're going to be right
- [82:59] right and it's sort of like you know me
- [83:01] be loving chips so much you know I had a
- [83:04] good business but like it did not pop
- [83:05] off until like you know AI like there
- [83:07] were a few people working in my company
- [83:08] not 20 right so sort like same thing as
- [83:10] like being so inly focused and good at
- [83:12] it but then all of a sudden the time
- [83:14] does come and you were right right like
- [83:15] it's like this is like uh those are the
- [83:17] kind of startups I like the most not
- [83:19] necessarily people who are like
- [83:20] Outsiders to a field and just want to
- [83:21] revolutionize it well we always like to
- [83:23] leave the last word uh you um I can't
- [83:25] imagine there's much of a vend diagram
- [83:27] of folks that listen to this podcast and
- [83:28] aren't subscribed to semi analysis so I
- [83:30] assume some folks are at least a high
- [83:31] level familiar with you but uh would
