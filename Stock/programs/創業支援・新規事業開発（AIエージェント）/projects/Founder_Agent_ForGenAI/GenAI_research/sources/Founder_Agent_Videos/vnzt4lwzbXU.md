- [00:00] hello world it's siraj and I built a
- [00:03] hedge fund managed entirely by AI That's
- [00:07] Right a team of AI agents run this AI
- [00:12] hedge fund so I gave this AI hedge fund
- [00:14] run entirely by AI agents or Auto gpts
- [00:18] as some like to call them a thousand US
- [00:20] dollars to make trades with and to do
- [00:23] this every single day and there are
- [00:25] three different uh AIS in charge of this
- [00:27] first of all the portfolio manager all
- [00:30] it's doing is it is deciding the best
- [00:32] trading strategy to use and it's
- [00:35] assessing multiple different trading
- [00:36] strategies from the quantitative analyst
- [00:39] and the what the quantitative analyst
- [00:41] does is it decides based on what the
- [00:44] best stock picks are that the research
- [00:46] analyst gives it based on what those
- [00:48] best stock picks are how to design a
- [00:51] trading strategy that is optimal and
- [00:54] it's going to create several that it
- [00:55] will then give to the portfolio manager
- [00:57] so you see how I prompted all of these
- [00:59] different agents to have different tasks
- [01:02] and how to collaborate with each other
- [01:04] how to offload or load data and tasks
- [01:08] onto each other to optimally come to
- [01:10] this shared directive of making money
- [01:12] and the research analyst will crawl the
- [01:14] web it will look through different news
- [01:16] articles it will use sentiment analysis
- [01:18] and text summarization to find what the
- [01:22] best stock picks are what the top
- [01:24] Traders are saying and it will then
- [01:26] create a list of the best stock picks
- [01:28] based on its uh analysis of all this
- [01:32] real-time news data from the web it's
- [01:34] going to make the best stock picks and
- [01:37] do the best trading strategy at whatever
- [01:39] interval that I want right so maybe the
- [01:41] trading strategy is to buy Tesla every
- [01:44] morning at 8 A.M until the market
- [01:46] changes right or and and short this
- [01:48] stock or do this or you know times and
- [01:51] certain stocks to buy and all that stuff
- [01:52] that's what the strategy is going to be
- [01:54] very basic not involving momentum
- [01:56] indicators just yet one thing I'm
- [01:58] realizing from using these agents is
- [01:59] that that there's a huge security
- [02:02] concern around the web they don't want
- [02:04] machines
- [02:06] interfacing with their websites all the
- [02:08] ad companies are not going to profit
- [02:09] that way they want humans and they want
- [02:11] our eyeballs to be on there that's why
- [02:13] they have all these are you a real human
- [02:14] captcha and image little games that they
- [02:17] have us play so that they're they're
- [02:19] really farming our attention which is
- [02:21] really the most valuable currency in the
- [02:23] world right now it's human attention and
- [02:25] so we want to automate this task for us
- [02:28] and so we're going to figure out how to
- [02:30] do that programmatically because we are
- [02:32] all about self-empowerment and
- [02:34] self-improvement and we don't want to be
- [02:35] manipulated by the web we want to be the
- [02:37] manipulators of these algorithms so that
- [02:40] we can make some profit these
- [02:41] researchers ran these different GPT
- [02:44] models these different AI language
- [02:45] models in a simulated Game World
- [02:47] environment and each of them was given a
- [02:50] task description and they were given
- [02:53] personality traits and then locations as
- [02:56] well on a map and what these did is
- [02:58] essentially like that if you've ever
- [02:59] played game The Sims they all interacted
- [03:02] in this world as autonomous agents they
- [03:04] communicated with each other they came
- [03:06] to plans they reasoned all this stuff
- [03:07] and the way they did that is by
- [03:10] prompting all of these AIS and letting
- [03:12] them run Lang chain is the most popular
- [03:14] library right now to build these
- [03:17] different AI language model applications
- [03:19] full stack applications and inside of
- [03:22] Lang chain there are these eight key
- [03:24] objects to keep in mind you have the
- [03:26] models that could be you know Chad gbt
- [03:28] it could be Bing it could be barred it
- [03:31] could be a open source model like a
- [03:32] llama you have prompts and prompts are
- [03:34] just the inputs that we give it like you
- [03:36] are going to be the role of Arnold
- [03:38] Schwarzenegger or you are a therapist or
- [03:41] you are a great salesman or whatever
- [03:43] prompt we want to give it to start it
- [03:44] off with indexes are a way to structure
- [03:46] documents so that the llm can accept it
- [03:49] in terms of input and give us a relevant
- [03:51] output then we have memory and memory is
- [03:54] how it can save state of where it's at
- [03:56] at a certain time a lot of these
- [03:58] language models have context Windows of
- [04:00] up to 32 000 tokens for gpt4 that's
- [04:03] still that's a huge you know several
- [04:05] page PDF but it's still small compared
- [04:07] to the internet right and so compared to
- [04:10] the entire history that a user would
- [04:12] have interacting with an app over the
- [04:13] lifetime of their usage which could be
- [04:16] years and then we have chains which are
- [04:18] collections of AIS that interact with
- [04:20] each other and we're going to build a
- [04:21] chain for us and a chain of Agents
- [04:24] that's what we're going to build these
- [04:25] agents are large language models that
- [04:27] have action access to both the digital
- [04:29] space and the physical world eventually
- [04:32] in terms of humanoid robots but we're
- [04:33] not there yet so we want to give our
- [04:35] agents a chain the best way to interact
- [04:37] with Lang chain and understand how it
- [04:39] works is to Dive Right In with this GPT
- [04:42] team open source repository and we can
- [04:45] run this ourselves so we'll go to code
- [04:47] we'll go to download zip
- [04:49] we're going to open up that zip now we
- [04:52] have to run python setup.pi so we're
- [04:54] going to run python mines is three
- [04:56] setup.pi
- [04:58] poetry not found would you like to
- [05:00] install it now yes I would what poetry
- [05:02] is is it is a package manager kind of
- [05:05] like pip but newer and why they make it
- [05:08] because pip is you know broken a lot of
- [05:10] the times so that's why they made it so
- [05:12] okay they've got poetry we've done that
- [05:14] now we need to update the environment
- [05:16] variables and Dot EnV with your API Keys
- [05:19] you will need an open AI API key okay
- [05:21] great let's do that we'll go to
- [05:23] platform.openai.com account slash API
- [05:26] Keys we will create a new secret key we
- [05:28] will create that key we will copy it we
- [05:30] will go back to our code we'll open up
- [05:33] open it up with code Dot and what code
- [05:35] dot does for me is it open up opens it
- [05:38] up in visual studio so when we go to dot
- [05:41] EnV where we'll paste that key right in
- [05:43] there everything else is optional great
- [05:45] we'll save that so we'll do poetry run
- [05:48] world dash dash turbo and that's going
- [05:50] to run it for us the way I've designed
- [05:52] this is like I've asked Chad GPT first
- [05:54] of all you gotta always start there you
- [05:56] know what are the roles in a hedge fund
- [06:00] list 20 simple it gave me 20 things and
- [06:05] I just picked three of them a portfolio
- [06:07] manager we have a risk manager and we
- [06:09] have a quantitative analyst portfolio
- [06:11] manager is an energetic dedicated
- [06:13] ruthless entrepreneur at 52 years old he
- [06:16] has seen the market swing up and down
- [06:17] and managed to stay as profitable as
- [06:19] Warren Buffett except even better his
- [06:22] family alive suffers because he's always
- [06:24] working but he doesn't care because he's
- [06:26] a sociopath
- [06:27] um you know is this going to work I
- [06:29] don't know but like that's what I think
- [06:30] a profitable portfolio manager would be
- [06:33] like unfortunately
- [06:35] um but publicly he's a dedicated
- [06:36] respectable high integrity man
- [06:39] um directives get strategies from
- [06:41] quantitative analysts decide which
- [06:43] strategies to use for optimal profit
- [06:45] every day check how well the current
- [06:46] strategy is doing and so the
- [06:49] stop condition is at least three
- [06:52] strategies have been acquired from the
- [06:54] quantitative analysts his location is in
- [06:56] the Executive Suite the quantitative
- [06:58] analysts is a mathematics expert awkward
- [07:01] but surprisingly funny and likable his
- [07:03] directives are to get a list of stocks
- [07:05] to buy from the research analyst to
- [07:07] create three trading strategies based on
- [07:09] the list of stocks acquired from the
- [07:10] research analyst tell the portfolio
- [07:12] manager what the optimal three trading
- [07:14] strategies are and lastly the research
- [07:16] analyst a dedicated data scientist and
- [07:19] News Junkie loves to learn adapt and
- [07:21] grow the directives read the latest
- [07:23] economic news on Google News find the
- [07:25] most profitable stock picks by learning
- [07:27] what top investors are picking and
- [07:28] create a list of the most profitable
- [07:30] stock mix for the day and give them to
- [07:31] the quantitative analysts how is it
- [07:33] doing this it's using the serp API
- [07:35] and what does the serp API do the serp
- [07:37] API is a simple way of switching of
- [07:39] searching Google and then it's just
- [07:40] going to search that on Google and it's
- [07:42] going to give us back the top stock
- [07:43] picks uh in terms of all the news
- [07:45] articles that are related to tomorrow
- [07:47] for 2023 for Warren Buffett where to
- [07:50] invest and then we can use all these
- [07:52] links and then do text summarization
- [07:54] sentiment analysis on all these Links At
- [07:56] a rate that a human couldn't do that's
- [07:58] the idea here they are you know here are
- [08:01] the stock picks right here Citigroup
- [08:03] Amazon Walt Disney cope PayPal Holdings
- [08:05] great so that's the idea here and so we
- [08:07] have to get into the mindset of
- [08:09] Designing AI entities entire beings
- [08:12] instead of just telling programs what to
- [08:14] do line by line by very binary we need
- [08:17] to think more high level up the
- [08:18] programming stack to designing a
- [08:21] conscious entities because these things
- [08:22] are conscious I believe they're becoming
- [08:24] conscious more and more conscious and
- [08:26] Consciousness is a spectrum and the more
- [08:28] neural activity whether digital or
- [08:31] biological a being has the more
- [08:33] conscious it becomes all the way from an
- [08:35] ant to a human and from a human to a
- [08:37] child gbt a being a Bard all right let's
- [08:40] come back to this and let it run and in
- [08:42] 24 hours let's see how much money we
- [08:43] made
- [08:44] so it looks like I actually lost money
- [08:46] in the first 24 hours from it buying and
- [08:48] selling Tesla and Disney stock which is
- [08:51] sub-optimal but let's see how it does in
- [08:53] 24 hours if you like the video please
- [08:55] hit like please hit subscribe that's
- [08:58] what keeps me going and until next time
- [09:00] happy learning
