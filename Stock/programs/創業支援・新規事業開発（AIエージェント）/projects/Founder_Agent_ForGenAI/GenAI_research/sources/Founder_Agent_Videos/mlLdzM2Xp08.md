- [00:06] We'll be discussing what is an agentic
- [00:09] behavior, why do we need multiple agents
- [00:13] and use cases of multiple agent
- [00:15] workflows, and then we're going to
- [00:18] discuss how to build multi- aent
- [00:20] workflows. And at the end of this theory
- [00:23] session, we're going to do the hands-on
- [00:25] exercise where we'll create a supervisor
- [00:28] of multiple agent and then it's going to
- [00:30] route it to the relevant agent and then
- [00:33] get the response from it. So I remember
- [00:36] from the last year on the same month I
- [00:38] was teaching how to build uh chat bots
- [00:41] like chat GPD that can generate
- [00:43] responses based on the text or based on
- [00:45] the question you are giving. But now as
- [00:48] the uh as this LLM ecosystem has been uh
- [00:52] developed and it has uh widened its use
- [00:56] cases now we we are at this platform
- [00:58] where we have to create an agent
- [01:01] behavior. So a a food for thought for
- [01:05] you is consider planning your travel or
- [01:09] you're planning a travel to another
- [01:12] country. So consider an agent that can
- [01:15] actually uh book your hotels uh book
- [01:19] your calendar meetings, send out the
- [01:21] invites and then also set up your uh
- [01:26] restaurants uh meetup as well. So, an
- [01:29] agent that can have multiple scenarios
- [01:32] catered out for you just like you have
- [01:35] your personal assistant or you have uh a
- [01:38] legal assistant or you have an advisor
- [01:42] that can actually uh work your way
- [01:45] through legal issues. So, that's how an
- [01:48] agentic behavior looks like in an in
- [01:51] concept of LLM based applications. it
- [01:54] actually uh has this idea of acting
- [01:58] autonomously and making decisions on
- [02:00] their own and performing task with
- [02:03] minimal human intervention. So as I
- [02:06] mentioned before uh you can think of a
- [02:09] hundreds of such tasks that you can
- [02:12] automate with an agentic behavior and
- [02:14] that's the beauty of AI that you can
- [02:17] actually avail all of these with just
- [02:20] one click and one fire of the supervisor
- [02:23] and it's going to uh do the reasoning
- [02:25] for you and it's going it's going to do
- [02:27] the decision making for you all at once.
- [02:31] So in this theoretical part we'll be
- [02:33] discussing what are some of the use
- [02:36] cases of multi- aent workflows how we
- [02:38] can have a router agent how we can have
- [02:41] a supervisor agent that can have
- [02:43] multiple hands of different agents and
- [02:46] then iterate it as the need occurs.
- [02:51] So let's move forward over why do we
- [02:55] need multiple agents. So consider you
- [02:59] are leading a team of 12 different
- [03:02] people. One is from the marketing team,
- [03:05] one is from the sales team, one one
- [03:07] person is from the uh HR or legal team.
- [03:12] So these uh different domains can only
- [03:16] be can only be worked efficiently when
- [03:19] you have different owners of this
- [03:21] domain. So in order to understand a
- [03:24] multi- aent scenario, you must think of
- [03:26] it like you you are working with an
- [03:29] organization that have all of these
- [03:31] different domains and then you will be
- [03:33] picking one point of contact from all of
- [03:36] this domain and that point of contact
- [03:38] will do all of the chores related to
- [03:40] that domain. So if I draw something
- [03:43] really quick on this slide deck. So it
- [03:47] would look like something this like you
- [03:49] have an organization a CEO over here and
- [03:53] it has all of this different domains.
- [03:56] You have a sales team, you have an HR
- [03:59] team, you have a marketing team
- [04:03] and then you have a legal team. So a
- [04:07] multi- aent workflow can actually help
- [04:11] the CEO as a personal assistant whether
- [04:14] he wants to ask what was the sales
- [04:16] revenue. So if the question was what's
- [04:19] what was the sales revenue this this
- [04:23] personal assistant agent would actually
- [04:26] route this query towards the sales agent
- [04:32] and if if this CEO ask
- [04:35] uh if they are going through if they are
- [04:38] going through a set of uh HR policies or
- [04:41] if they are if the CEO wants to ask
- [04:43] about some HR policies he he can just
- [04:47] this this personal assistant can just
- [04:49] route the query towards the HR agent. So
- [04:53] consider all of these different agents
- [04:55] as separate logical units and then this
- [04:59] personal assistant would actually route
- [05:01] your specific query towards the domain
- [05:04] you have you are being asking you are
- [05:07] asking the question from and that's how
- [05:10] just one supervisor can actually
- [05:13] skyrocket your efficiency and
- [05:14] productivity and each agents get to
- [05:17] focus on their area their expertise
- [05:20] which actually helps in minimizing the
- [05:22] bottlenecks and maximizing the output.
- [05:25] So this is the new era of AI and LLMs
- [05:30] that people are moving forward towards
- [05:32] and this is how uh this superficial
- [05:36] intelligence and the AI would actually
- [05:39] rule the world with multi- aent
- [05:41] scenarios and then they will have
- [05:44] multiple skill sets that they can
- [05:46] actually acquire as they are learning
- [05:48] their way forward towards that. So here
- [05:51] is an example of what I have previously
- [05:54] discussed. Let's take an example. If you
- [05:57] just have a single agent uh system where
- [06:00] it is just used for writing the content
- [06:03] for you.
- [06:05] So now most of the people critic about
- [06:10] how do we know that the responses AI is
- [06:12] generating is good enough or maybe they
- [06:15] are not hallucinating. So then we can
- [06:18] also have an agent that actually judges
- [06:21] the responses output. So I have been in
- [06:25] a conversation with a number of people
- [06:28] uh as I meet them, they always ask how
- [06:32] do I rely on the responses from AI?
- [06:36] How can I be assured that this response
- [06:39] is 100% true? So in order to answer to
- [06:43] those questions, let's say we have a
- [06:46] critic agent as well. We can have an
- [06:49] LLM. There is a concept of having LLM as
- [06:53] a judge. So whatever the response we
- [06:55] will get from this agent. Let's say I
- [06:58] have this agent one.
- [07:01] So I I ask him to write the content for
- [07:04] me. And on the other hand, I can al once
- [07:08] I get the response from this agent,
- [07:11] I can still pass this response to a
- [07:15] critic agent or the judge or the
- [07:18] panelist that's that is going to
- [07:20] actually rate my response whether it is
- [07:25] four out of five, whether it is three
- [07:27] out of five. And based on that rating,
- [07:31] I'm going to pass this to an another
- [07:33] agent to minim to incorporate the
- [07:37] feedback. So I'm going to collect the
- [07:38] feedback from this judge or critic
- [07:40] agent. So I'm going to so it it will
- [07:44] look like a closed loop where you are
- [07:46] iterating over the feedback and once you
- [07:49] once you are once you have the accuracy
- [07:51] of 95% or 98% then you would call it
- [07:55] that this response has been iterated
- [07:57] over and over again we have incorporated
- [08:00] the feedback from the judge or the
- [08:02] critic agent and that's how you actually
- [08:05] progress in this era where you actually
- [08:08] try to reduce the hallucination of these
- [08:10] agents.
- [08:12] So that's why we really need a mult
- [08:14] multi- aent scenarios where we set up
- [08:17] those agents so that it can put our
- [08:20] evaluation it can put our guard rails to
- [08:23] a certain extent where we don't have to
- [08:25] be on the back foot that whether this
- [08:29] agent would be a good fit for the
- [08:31] response or would be a good fit in
- [08:33] healthcare or not.
