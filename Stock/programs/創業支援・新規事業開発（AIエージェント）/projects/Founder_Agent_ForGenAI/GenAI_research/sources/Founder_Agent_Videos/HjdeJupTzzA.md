- [00:00] Hey guys, yesterday OpenAI just
- [00:02] completely blew all of our minds with
- [00:05] all of the new features and tools that
- [00:07] they have announced to make it easier to
- [00:09] build real world AI applications. But
- [00:11] the most important announcement they
- [00:13] made was the release of Agent Kit, which
- [00:16] is a brand new tool that makes it easier
- [00:18] to build, deploy, and optimize real
- [00:21] world agents. So, in today's video, I'm
- [00:23] going to be breaking down everything you
- [00:25] guys need to know about Agent Kit,
- [00:27] including what the heck is it, what can
- [00:29] it do, and I'm going to be walking
- [00:30] through a few real world examples of us
- [00:33] making some agents using this new tool.
- [00:35] All right, so here's what you need to
- [00:36] know. OpenAI had their dev day yesterday
- [00:39] where they released all sorts of brand
- [00:41] new features. Cannot recommend watching
- [00:43] this video of Sam where he covers all of
- [00:45] it. Definitely recommend checking that
- [00:47] out. But inside his announcement, you're
- [00:49] going to see all sorts of a new cool
- [00:51] products that he's releasing. Everything
- [00:53] from the ability to add in apps to
- [00:55] chatbt, some cool new updates to Sora so
- [00:57] that you can use the API. But the most
- [00:59] important one in my opinion was their
- [01:02] announcement of agent kit, which is a
- [01:04] super easy way for you to build
- [01:06] production grade agents. So, let's
- [01:08] actually hop in so you can see exactly
- [01:10] what's going on inside of Agent Kit. So
- [01:11] the whole promise of this new tool is to
- [01:14] allow you guys to build, deploy, and
- [01:16] optimize realworld agents. And they have
- [01:19] made it so easy it feels like cheating
- [01:21] when it comes to building out these
- [01:22] agents. Now, it's actually a combination
- [01:25] of multiple tools. So agent kit really
- [01:27] is a combination of their agent builder
- [01:30] tool plus chatkit. And we're going to be
- [01:32] walking through these and actually
- [01:33] building out examples throughout the
- [01:35] rest of this video, but let's cover
- [01:36] quickly what each tool is. So first
- [01:38] things first, agent builder. If you ever
- [01:40] used inadin where you go off and
- [01:42] actually build out agents to where you,
- [01:44] you know, you drag in an agent and then
- [01:46] you do a workflow and then different
- [01:48] agents go to different place. This is
- [01:50] agent builder. It is incredibly easy to
- [01:52] use and, you know, it feels like
- [01:54] cheating when building agents. Now,
- [01:55] what's really cool is this UI that you
- [01:58] guys are going to be seeing me build
- [01:59] some agents here and showing off all of
- [02:01] the cool new features in just a second.
- [02:03] What's really happening under the hood
- [02:04] is we're building on top of agent SDK.
- [02:08] So, this is already a tool that they
- [02:09] build, but they just made a really nice
- [02:11] UI for us to create our own AI agents.
- [02:14] Super excited to dive in. Now, that's
- [02:16] building out the agents, but what about
- [02:17] actually adding these agents to your
- [02:20] applications? Well, that's usually one
- [02:22] of the hardest parts about building AI
- [02:23] tools. So, they released Chatkit, which
- [02:26] is a really cool toolkit that allows you
- [02:28] to actually add these different agent
- [02:30] workflows that you're building into your
- [02:32] application. And it's crazy. We'll dive
- [02:34] into this later on, but you can actually
- [02:35] build out cool UIs just like this to
- [02:38] where you can talk to AI. It'll actually
- [02:39] pop up cool widgets. Like it does so
- [02:42] many cool things and we're going to be
- [02:42] going through all of this together
- [02:44] today. So, what do we need to do? Well,
- [02:45] first things first, we need to hop over
- [02:47] to agent builder. And don't worry, I
- [02:49] will have links to everything that you
- [02:51] guys are going to be seeing today so you
- [02:52] can easily hop around. But like I said,
- [02:54] second you click the link, it's going to
- [02:56] take you into the docs where you're
- [02:58] going to see, yep, we promise we'll help
- [03:00] you build, deploy, and optimize your
- [03:02] agents. But what we want is agent
- [03:04] builder. And most importantly, we want
- [03:05] to open agent builder to where we get to
- [03:07] start on creating our own new canvas. So
- [03:10] you can see whenever you go to access
- [03:12] agent builder, once again, I'll have a
- [03:14] link to it so you can easily hop to it.
- [03:15] But what you're going to see is you can
- [03:17] create your own custom workflows or what
- [03:20] you can do is access a bunch of their
- [03:21] pre-built templates that they've already
- [03:23] created for us. So you can see they have
- [03:24] everything from customer service where
- [03:27] you're going to be able to add in agents
- [03:29] plus workflows and conditions where each
- [03:31] condition triggers its own agent. So
- [03:32] they have an insane amount of cool new
- [03:34] features for us. But what I want to do
- [03:36] today is actually walk you through two
- [03:37] different examples where we're going to
- [03:39] create agents from scratch, explore all
- [03:41] of the different ways we can actually
- [03:43] customize these agents and have them
- [03:45] work in real time. And then at the very
- [03:46] end, you're going to see how we can
- [03:48] actually embed one of these agents
- [03:49] inside of an X.js application. Super
- [03:51] excited. So without further ado, let's
- [03:53] go ahead and start working on creating
- [03:54] our first workflow. All right, so for
- [03:55] the first example, we're going to build
- [03:57] out a basic Q&A workflow. And we're
- [04:00] going to start really simple so you can
- [04:01] understand the core fundamentals. And
- [04:03] then we're going to add in more and more
- [04:04] functionality just so you can see how
- [04:06] easy it is to build really powerful AI
- [04:08] agents using agent builder. So what
- [04:10] we're going to do, first things first,
- [04:12] we want to create a workflow. So when we
- [04:14] click create, what we're going to do is
- [04:16] be brought into a very basic workflow
- [04:18] like this. And here are the core
- [04:20] controls that you guys need to know. So,
- [04:22] first things first, you're going to be
- [04:23] able to add all the core elements like
- [04:25] agents where in whenever you click an
- [04:27] agent, you're going to have the ability
- [04:29] to start to add instructions. You're
- [04:32] going to have the ability to tweak
- [04:34] everything about this agent. Don't
- [04:35] worry, we're going to cover that more.
- [04:36] But what's really cool is they've also
- [04:38] given us the ability to add in tools.
- [04:41] So, we can add in the ability for us to
- [04:43] do file search, which is where we can
- [04:45] start to do rag against the vector
- [04:47] store. They have the ability for us to
- [04:48] do guard rails where guardrails allow us
- [04:50] to basically say, "Hey, I want to
- [04:53] protect what we're building against
- [04:55] multiple things such as like, hey, I
- [04:57] don't want people to include PII. I
- [04:59] don't want people to jailbreak it. I
- [05:01] don't want to include hallucinations."
- [05:02] Like, there's so many cool tools that
- [05:04] they've added to help us build really
- [05:07] safe and effective AI agents. And that's
- [05:09] the whole promise. Build, deploy, and
- [05:11] actually optimize enterprisegrade AI
- [05:14] agents. Then outside of that, you have
- [05:15] the ability to add MCP tools where you
- [05:18] can actually come in here and connect up
- [05:20] to all sorts of different servers. Don't
- [05:21] worry, you're going to see us work on
- [05:22] this in a second. Finally, you have the
- [05:24] ability to add in workflows. So, you can
- [05:27] add in if else statements to where if
- [05:30] we're trying to do customer service,
- [05:31] what we can do is say, "Hey, if my
- [05:33] agents trying to answer a question about
- [05:36] the tech support, we'll direct them to
- [05:38] the tech support agent. If they're just
- [05:40] trying to get a refund, we'll direct
- [05:41] them to the refund agent." you get to
- [05:42] work on all of this, you know,
- [05:44] conditionalbased workflows inside of
- [05:47] agent builder right here. Now, enough
- [05:49] talk. Let's actually go ahead and build
- [05:50] out our very first agent. And like I
- [05:52] said, we're going to do a very basic
- [05:53] query agent and then we're going to add
- [05:55] more complexity. And don't worry, in
- [05:57] example two, we're going to do rag.
- [05:58] Super excited for you guys to see this.
- [06:00] So, for this first one, what we're going
- [06:01] to do is we're actually just going to
- [06:02] call this our code Q&A agent. Now, what
- [06:05] is this going to do? Well, this agent is
- [06:07] we're actually going to use MCP to
- [06:09] answer code questions. Super excited for
- [06:11] you guys to see this in action. So, one
- [06:13] of the coolest things that we can do is
- [06:14] say, "Hey, it is your job to answer
- [06:18] questions provided by the user." And
- [06:20] every time you answer a code question
- [06:22] about the user, you need to use the
- [06:24] context 7 tool to make sure that you get
- [06:28] all the necessary information to provide
- [06:30] a informed answer. Now, what this is
- [06:32] going to do is we're going to now start
- [06:35] working on adding in tools. And this is
- [06:37] where I'm just like blown away with how
- [06:39] easy it is to actually use agent
- [06:40] builder. So to add a tool, what you can
- [06:42] do is click add tool right here. Once we
- [06:45] add a tool, you have the option to add
- [06:47] in, you know, multiple different
- [06:49] versions. So you can do an MCP tool, you
- [06:51] can use file search, if you want to do
- [06:52] rag, you can add in web search, code
- [06:54] interpreter, like there's so many
- [06:55] built-in tools that you guys get to add
- [06:57] automatically. In our case, what we want
- [06:58] to do is add in an MCP server where
- [07:01] we're going to use Context 7. Now, if
- [07:03] you haven't used Context 7 before, it is
- [07:05] a really cool tool that allows us to
- [07:07] access up-to-date documents that we can
- [07:10] easily provide to access questions about
- [07:12] anything related to code. So, we can
- [07:14] access any question about Nex.js,
- [07:16] Verscell, like we can do
- [07:18] anything. It's crazy. This is one of my
- [07:19] favorite MCP tools. So, what we're going
- [07:21] to do is we want to actually add MCP as
- [07:24] a server. So, what we can do is in our
- [07:27] case, we'll just open one of these cuz
- [07:28] all we really need is this URL. Then we
- [07:31] can come back over to agent builder and
- [07:33] say, "Hey, I would actually like to add
- [07:35] in a custom server." So we can click
- [07:37] server and we're going to say, "Hey, I
- [07:39] would like to add in this custom MCP
- [07:41] server. I want to call this context 7."
- [07:43] So this is the name of the tool. And
- [07:45] what we're going to do next is say,
- [07:46] "Hey, I there's no need to add any
- [07:49] authentication. We're just going to
- [07:50] connect to this tool." Now, it's going
- [07:52] to say, "All right, I want to connect to
- [07:53] this tool and here are the underlying
- [07:55] tool calls I can make when using context
- [07:58] 7." What's really nice about the way
- [08:00] that agent builder allows us to add in
- [08:02] tools is you guys can pick, hey,
- [08:04] whenever we're calling a tool, what do
- [08:06] you want to do? Do you want to always
- [08:08] require approval, never, or, you know,
- [08:10] be configured? In our case, we're just
- [08:11] going to say never. It's okay to always
- [08:13] do a search. We're not doing anything
- [08:14] crazy. So, let's actually dive into a
- [08:16] little bit more available options that
- [08:18] we have when it comes to controlling
- [08:19] agents so that we can be on the same
- [08:20] page. So you always have the ability to
- [08:23] pick which different model that you guys
- [08:24] want to use when it comes to reasoning
- [08:27] cuz you know GPT5 is a thinking model.
- [08:29] We can pick do you want me to think a
- [08:31] long time a little time? What do you
- [08:32] want to do? In our case we'll just stick
- [08:34] to low so we can focus on quickly
- [08:36] returning an answer. Now one of my
- [08:37] favorite parts and you're going to see
- [08:38] us use this later but you can actually
- [08:40] pick how do you want the output to be.
- [08:42] Do you want us just to return text? Do
- [08:44] you want us to return JSON? Do you want
- [08:46] us to also work on a widget using
- [08:48] chatkit? Don't worry, you're gonna see
- [08:50] all these later, but for right now,
- [08:51] we're just going to stick to text. So,
- [08:53] at this point, we're going to go ahead
- [08:54] and try it out. And actually, this
- [08:56] point, you're going to see just how easy
- [08:57] it is to actually use one of these
- [08:58] agents. The only final thing I do want
- [09:00] to call out up here is how you can
- [09:03] actually add questions to basically add
- [09:05] context to your questions. So, what you
- [09:07] can always do is say, hey, you know, it
- [09:10] is your job to answer questions that
- [09:12] were given to the user. So, you know,
- [09:13] answer the following user question. Now,
- [09:17] all we have to do is click add context
- [09:19] and then you guys can click input as
- [09:21] text. Where the heck is this coming
- [09:23] from, you might ask? Well, it's coming
- [09:25] from start. So, start is going to be the
- [09:27] first message that gets passed into our
- [09:29] agent. And you can see this is what's
- [09:30] getting passed in. So, enough talk.
- [09:32] Let's actually try this out. So, inside
- [09:34] of agent builder, you can click preview.
- [09:36] And this is going to give you a quick
- [09:37] preview to try out your agent before you
- [09:39] deploy it. Super cool that they allow
- [09:41] you to do this and actually try it out.
- [09:43] So what I can say is what is the latest
- [09:47] version of and sometimes this gets
- [09:49] spelled wrong. So AI SDK. So at this
- [09:51] point I'm saying hey what's the latest
- [09:53] version of Verscell AI SDK which is a
- [09:56] really cool tool that you can use inside
- [09:58] of Nex.js to actually chat with AI
- [10:00] models. Now at this point what it's
- [10:02] doing is it's like cool I need to fetch
- [10:04] SDK version. I'm going to use the
- [10:06] context 7 tool like we told it to to
- [10:08] actually call and figure out the latest
- [10:10] version. And you can see what's really
- [10:12] nice is it in the reasoning steps it
- [10:14] actually made a bunch of calls to versel
- [10:17] AI SDK. So it's saying all right I'm
- [10:19] going to call this tool with inside of
- [10:22] context 7 to try and figure out what is
- [10:24] the latest version and it's basically
- [10:26] going to provide back an answer. And yes
- [10:28] this is you know versel AI SDK is at
- [10:30] version 5. So it did an awesome job. And
- [10:33] you know it's asking for a few follow-up
- [10:34] questions but hey it's working. This is
- [10:36] this is the part that's crazy. We just
- [10:37] built an agent, hooked up an MCP server,
- [10:39] and chatted with it in seconds. Like,
- [10:41] this is blowing my mind how easy it is.
- [10:44] So, at this point, we can close out.
- [10:45] Now, let's actually start diving into
- [10:47] some of the more advanced features or
- [10:49] some of the more, you know, capabilities
- [10:51] that we have when it comes to actually
- [10:53] answering questions. So, let's actually
- [10:55] clear out the workflow lines and let's
- [10:57] actually start building out another
- [10:58] agent to where we're like, hey, you know
- [11:00] what? Every time I build out an agent,
- [11:02] I'm not always trying to ask questions
- [11:04] about code. Sometimes I have general
- [11:06] questions. So what we can do is say
- [11:08] general Q&A agent and the whole point of
- [11:11] this agent is going to be hey it is your
- [11:14] job to answer general questions provided
- [11:17] by the users and make sure to use the
- [11:19] web search tool to provide a informed
- [11:22] answer to the user's question. Now at
- [11:24] this point it is super simple once again
- [11:27] what do we have to do we can actually
- [11:29] provide in the user question. Now, what
- [11:31] we're going to do though is we're going
- [11:32] to start actually using some of the
- [11:34] advanced tools here, like if else, and
- [11:37] we're going to start to use some routing
- [11:38] and categorization. This is normally
- [11:41] this takes forever to set up, but it
- [11:42] takes seconds. So, you're about to see
- [11:43] it. So, we're going to go ahead and pass
- [11:44] in the user question once again. So, we
- [11:46] can click add context, and we're going
- [11:48] to once again, we are adding in the
- [11:50] initial question provided by the user.
- [11:52] What's also really cool is you can
- [11:54] actually add in the entire chat history.
- [11:57] What this is going to allow you guys to
- [11:58] do, I just want to bring this up as
- [11:59] well, is as you have a longer
- [12:01] conversation to where, you know, maybe
- [12:03] to start we had a question to the code
- [12:05] agent, then later on we had a follow-up
- [12:06] question to our general Q&A agent. Hey,
- [12:09] we're going to allow our agent to access
- [12:10] our entire chat history. So, really cool
- [12:13] that you can just with a flick of a
- [12:14] switch change what information is being
- [12:16] provided to your agents. All right. Now,
- [12:18] what do we want to do this time? Well,
- [12:19] now what we're trying to do is we want
- [12:21] to use the web search because we want
- [12:23] the agent to go search the web to answer
- [12:25] our questions. So, we're just going to
- [12:27] leave it all completely blank for right
- [12:29] now to where it just has total control
- [12:30] and can go search whatever it needs to.
- [12:32] Now, what we're going to do is you're
- [12:34] going to see how we can start to build
- [12:35] in actual workflows to make our lives
- [12:38] easier. So, as you can see right now, we
- [12:40] are at a spot where we have to route
- [12:42] questions to the code agent or route
- [12:44] questions to the general Q&A agent. I
- [12:47] probably should spell that correctly,
- [12:48] too. So, how the heck do we do this
- [12:50] inside of agent builder? Well, they've
- [12:52] made it so easy. What you can do is you
- [12:54] guys can add another agent that's going
- [12:56] to be a classifier. So what this agent
- [12:58] is going to do is we're just going to
- [13:00] say, "Hey, it's your job to classify
- [13:03] queries as either code or general." It
- [13:06] is your job to classify queries as a
- [13:09] code of code or general. And I meant to
- [13:12] say category. It's your job to classify
- [13:14] queries as code or general. Yeah, it's
- [13:15] perfect. Now, here's where we get to
- [13:17] start to be fancy. Up until this point,
- [13:19] our output format has always been text
- [13:22] where we're saying, "Hey, please just
- [13:23] respond to the person." But now what
- [13:25] we're doing is we're actually trying to
- [13:27] classify our queries as code or as
- [13:30] general. So what we can do is first off
- [13:33] we can say I want to use JSON. Now what
- [13:36] we get to do is add a JSON schema to
- [13:38] where we're going to say hey the output
- [13:39] is either code or general. Normally this
- [13:41] is a pain in the butt. You have to you
- [13:42] know be pretty techsavvy or talk to AI
- [13:44] to figure out how to actually make this
- [13:46] happen. They've made it super cool. You
- [13:48] down here you have a button to where you
- [13:50] can actually just generate the output
- [13:51] schema for one of your AI agents. So
- [13:53] we're going to click generate and then
- [13:54] once again we want to create a schema
- [13:57] where the categorization is either code
- [14:00] or general. That's it. That's literally
- [14:02] all we have to do to actually have it
- [14:05] transcribe what needs to be done. So now
- [14:07] it's going to take in our raw
- [14:08] instructions and say cool the category
- [14:11] of this output is an enum where the
- [14:13] response can either be code or general.
- [14:15] That's exactly what we wanted and it
- [14:17] took like two seconds to set up. That's
- [14:18] crazy. So, we're going to say update.
- [14:21] Fantastic. So, now the output format is
- [14:23] going to be passed out as
- [14:25] categorization. Then what we can do, I
- [14:28] did make a quick mistake. Once again, we
- [14:29] want to add in the input context just so
- [14:31] we can say once again user query just to
- [14:34] be super specific. Fantastic. So, now we
- [14:37] have our classifier agent. So, now we
- [14:39] get to start working on ifels. So if
- [14:41] else is where we're going to start to
- [14:42] bridge and make magic happen where we're
- [14:44] going to start to route things. So at
- [14:46] this point we're trying to classify
- [14:48] everything. So we're going to say all
- [14:50] right what can actually happen? Well at
- [14:52] this point what we can do is we'll say
- [14:54] if if it's a code so this is the name.
- [14:57] This is just the name that appears right
- [14:58] here. What we can do is start to put in
- [15:00] conditions. Now what conditions can we
- [15:03] actually like map on? Well you can see
- [15:06] we can actually access the category. The
- [15:08] category was defined right here by this
- [15:10] agent. So we actually specified it. So
- [15:13] category you can see right here
- [15:15] category. This is exactly what we
- [15:16] wanted. We can access it over here
- [15:18] inside if else statement. So right here
- [15:20] code I can once again click and let's
- [15:23] see there we go. So now I can click
- [15:25] category and it's like all right so
- [15:26] you've provided a category. What do you
- [15:28] want to do? Well we want to say if the
- [15:30] category equals in our case we can now
- [15:32] put some quotes and we can say code. So
- [15:35] if the category provided to us is code,
- [15:38] what we want to do is map over to our
- [15:41] next agent. So we're going to say if
- [15:43] it's code, map to the code agent.
- [15:45] Otherwise, map to our general Q&A. So
- [15:47] this is literally us building a real
- [15:49] world workflow to where we have a
- [15:51] classifier agent, we have if else, and
- [15:53] we have, you know, routing. So let's
- [15:55] actually try this out. So let's click
- [15:57] preview. And at this point, what we can
- [15:59] do is say, can you please tell me what
- [16:01] is the latest version of NextJS? Now, at
- [16:04] this point, it's going to classify. So,
- [16:07] the classifier is running. It's
- [16:08] reasoning. It's figuring out, okay, I
- [16:12] can detect that in the if else statement
- [16:14] that the category result was code. So,
- [16:17] I'm moving people over to the code agent
- [16:19] and then it's going to do its thing.
- [16:20] Now, what's also really cool, well, as
- [16:22] soon as it's done answering, we can ask
- [16:23] our next question to where we can see it
- [16:24] gets routed over to, you know, the other
- [16:27] Q&A agent. So, obviously reasoning is
- [16:30] low right now. We could probably pick a
- [16:31] faster model for simple questions, but
- [16:33] hey, it did a great job. It actually
- [16:34] answered our question and it routed
- [16:36] properly, which is crazy how easy it was
- [16:37] to get to the far. We can also ask
- [16:39] another question so you can just see in
- [16:40] action. What is the weather today in
- [16:42] Atlanta, Georgia? Now, at this point,
- [16:44] what it's going to do is it's going to
- [16:46] classify the question. And at this
- [16:48] point, we should see the classification
- [16:49] as general, not code. And we can now
- [16:52] see, yep, category general. So, now what
- [16:54] it's going to do is route us over to the
- [16:55] general agent. And the general agent has
- [16:57] access to the web. So, it's going to go
- [16:59] do a query to the internet to figure out
- [17:01] what today's date is. It's going to then
- [17:03] look up the weather and then come back
- [17:04] and say, "Hey, the weather is this today
- [17:06] in Atlanta, Georgia." Which is really
- [17:08] cool that it can do this. Yeah. So, you
- [17:09] can see, boom, it crushed it. Now, that
- [17:11] was a really quick overview of just
- [17:12] building out a super simple workflow
- [17:14] inside of Agent Kit. Now, what I want to
- [17:16] do next, now that you've seen Agent
- [17:18] Builder in action, let's go ahead and
- [17:19] hop over to part two where you guys are
- [17:21] going to start to see how we can build
- [17:23] out a more complex workflow where we're
- [17:25] going to use Rag. Super excited for you
- [17:27] guys to see see this in action. Plus,
- [17:28] you're going to see how we can actually
- [17:30] incorporate our rag solution over to a
- [17:33] Nex.js application. Like, it's crazy how
- [17:35] easy it is to hook all this up. So,
- [17:36] let's go ahead and hop over to working
- [17:38] on a brand new workflow. So, first
- [17:41] things first, we need to go back to
- [17:42] agent builder and we are going to click
- [17:44] create a workflow. Now, what we need to
- [17:47] do is basically make a new agent and
- [17:50] we're going to start simple and add in
- [17:52] complexity. So, this is just going to be
- [17:53] our rag query agent. And the whole point
- [17:57] of this agent in our case is it's going
- [17:59] to help answer questions that people
- [18:02] might have had about some of my coaching
- [18:03] calls. So, we're just going to give it a
- [18:05] quick instructions and then we're going
- [18:06] to add in a vector store. So, let's go
- [18:08] ahead and do it. Your job is to be a
- [18:10] query agent where you are going to
- [18:13] answer questions that students might
- [18:16] have had about the coaching calls during
- [18:19] the weekly shipkit coaching calls. and
- [18:21] it is your job to search up the
- [18:23] information for their question and
- [18:25] provide a well-informed answer. So,
- [18:27] what's it actually doing? Well, it's
- [18:29] actually doing just so you guys can see
- [18:30] what's going on. So, it's going to be
- [18:32] answering coaching call recordings. So,
- [18:34] I'm going to be building out a vector
- [18:36] store where it's going to be answering
- [18:39] questions that people might have had
- [18:41] during one of the coaching calls that I
- [18:42] have inside of Shipkit. So people are
- [18:44] going to be asking questions about like,
- [18:46] hey, what did Brandon tell me to do when
- [18:48] it comes to building a chat application
- [18:50] or a rag application? So it's going to
- [18:51] be helping answering these kind of
- [18:53] questions. So how the heck do we
- [18:54] actually make that happen? Well, now
- [18:56] that we have a rag agent, what we want
- [18:58] to do is go to tools and we're going to
- [19:01] add in the ability to do file search.
- [19:03] Now, whenever we do file search, what
- [19:05] we're going to do is we can actually
- [19:07] select a vector store. So you can see
- [19:08] right down here. So we're going to click
- [19:10] select vector store. And if you've never
- [19:12] made one before, it's so easy to do. Let
- [19:14] me show you. You're going to click
- [19:14] vector stores right here. And this is
- [19:16] going to take you over to OpenAI. And
- [19:18] you can see down here we have storage or
- [19:21] storage. We can add files or vector
- [19:23] stores. In our case, I all I did to get
- [19:25] this working is I clicked create. And
- [19:28] that created a brand new vector store
- [19:29] that I called Brandon Hancock. From
- [19:31] there, what I did is I added in files.
- [19:34] Which files did I add in? I basically
- [19:36] just added in the transcript of each one
- [19:38] of those. So I just create, let me
- [19:39] actually just show you guys real fast. I
- [19:41] added in markdown files just like this.
- [19:44] So call 1 2 3 4 where it's just the
- [19:46] transcript from these calls. Super super
- [19:48] straightforward. And now I attach these
- [19:50] files. So all we have to do on our side
- [19:53] to create a rag agent using OpenAI is
- [19:56] just copy this ID right here. So now
- [19:59] whenever we come back to our agent,
- [20:01] we're just going to paste in the vector
- [20:02] store and it's going to go, oh, you want
- [20:04] me to ask questions about this YouTube
- [20:06] vector store? Sure. So that's all we
- [20:08] have to do is select it. And at this
- [20:10] point, boom, this agent is now basically
- [20:12] has the ability to do rag queries
- [20:14] against this vector store. And the final
- [20:16] thing that we're going to do is just
- [20:17] pass in the user query. So we're going
- [20:19] to say user query. And let's make sure
- [20:22] everything else looks good. I just want
- [20:24] to make sure we spelled everything
- [20:25] right. Fantastic. This is all we need to
- [20:27] do to start actually testing out our
- [20:28] vector store, which is crazy. So here's
- [20:31] what we can do. Can you please tell me
- [20:33] when the last coaching call was for
- [20:35] shipkit.ai? And at this point, what it's
- [20:38] going to do is our agent is going to go,
- [20:40] "All right, I'm the rag agent. I'm now
- [20:42] going to search files." And at this
- [20:43] point, it's actually performing rag
- [20:45] queries. So, it's doing multiple calls
- [20:47] in parallel where it's trying to figure
- [20:48] out like, "All right, when was the last
- [20:50] session?" Once it gets back the results,
- [20:52] it's going to craft a response. And
- [20:54] what's cool is it's like, "All right,
- [20:55] the most recent Shipkit coaching call
- [20:57] was on October 7th. It was an hour and a
- [21:00] half call." And you can actually watch
- [21:02] the recording here. So you can actually
- [21:04] like you can click it like it's it's
- [21:06] doing full-blown rag where it's pulling
- [21:08] out stuff. So yeah, that's insane that
- [21:10] it was that easy to get a rag agent up
- [21:12] and working with OpenAI. Now what else
- [21:15] can we do? Well, there's a ton of other
- [21:18] features. Oop, sorry, that was a draft.
- [21:20] Uh, let me actually make sure I'm
- [21:21] clicking on the right one. Fantastic. So
- [21:24] let's make sure we don't make that
- [21:25] mistake again. So what we can do is call
- [21:27] this rag coaching. Boom. So now we have
- [21:30] our rag agent up and working. But that's
- [21:32] just level one. We can get much fancier
- [21:34] with this going forward. So what we can
- [21:37] do is we could add in guardrails. So
- [21:40] what we can do for guard rails is we
- [21:42] could actually, if we wanted to, I'm not
- [21:44] going to do it, but I just want to show
- [21:45] you guys. What you could do is make sure
- [21:47] people don't ask PII questions when
- [21:50] trying to do a rag query. So what they
- [21:52] couldn't do is, or heck, we could
- [21:54] actually do it on the end if you wanted
- [21:56] to. What we could do is say like, hey,
- [21:58] don't return anything with PII. So this
- [22:01] could be something like, you know, if we
- [22:03] don't want to show the person's name,
- [22:04] phone number, or something like that, we
- [22:06] could easily block it before it was sent
- [22:08] to the model. So there's all sorts of
- [22:10] cool things that we could we could do
- [22:12] here, but we're going to skip that one
- [22:14] for now. But I just want like these are
- [22:15] all the options that you guys can have
- [22:16] to where you can spin up in a few
- [22:17] seconds. In our case, what we want to do
- [22:19] is we actually want to include a
- [22:20] guardrail to prevent hallucinations. So
- [22:22] let me show you how easy this is to make
- [22:24] sure that the agent doesn't hallucinate
- [22:26] something that it's not supposed to. So
- [22:27] we can on in guardrail I can click it
- [22:30] and then I can say hallucinations
- [22:32] basically don't hallucinate and what
- [22:34] it's going to do is it is going to
- [22:36] verify claims against trusted documents
- [22:38] in your vector store. So I think the
- [22:40] easiest way to see this in action is
- [22:41] actually just go ahead and look at it.
- [22:42] So what we can do is browse the vector
- [22:44] store and actually I think I might have
- [22:46] it pasted still. Yeah. So you can see
- [22:48] this is the vector store and we're going
- [22:50] to just say add and you can if you
- [22:52] wanted to you can pick the model you
- [22:53] could pick the confidence but basically
- [22:55] for doing hallucination guardrails we
- [22:57] just want a quick model to say does this
- [23:00] look valid is this not valid if so
- [23:02] proceed. So we're going to say okay now
- [23:04] what do we need to do? Well, in our
- [23:05] case, this is my one complaint is they
- [23:08] don't make it easy to uh I wish the
- [23:10] editor was a little bit bigger, but in
- [23:11] our case, what we can do is pass our
- [23:14] results from our agent to guardrail.
- [23:17] Now, what guardrails are going to do is
- [23:20] two options. So, first, if we fail, what
- [23:22] we want to do is pass this information
- [23:24] over to one agent, and if it passes, we
- [23:27] want to pass it over to another agent.
- [23:29] So, what should be the result of the
- [23:32] agent if it works? So, we're just going
- [23:34] to say, please return the query answer
- [23:37] to the user. Now, what this is going to
- [23:39] do is we can actually add context. Which
- [23:41] context do we want to add? Well, in our
- [23:43] case, we want to add safe text. You'll
- [23:46] see what safe text is in just a second.
- [23:48] Here is the answer.
- [23:51] Here's here's the answer. And then we're
- [23:53] going to say here was the initial
- [23:56] question. So, at this point, we can
- [23:57] actually pass in both. So, input is
- [24:00] coming from here. the safe result is
- [24:02] coming from guardrails where guardrails
- [24:04] is basically saying like yeah this
- [24:05] information is safe. This was valid
- [24:07] information from the user. So that's
- [24:09] what we can have. So we can say you know
- [24:11] result agent. Then what we can do is on
- [24:15] the second agent we can have it say hey
- [24:17] something went wrong. So we'll call this
- [24:19] the unsafe answer agent. Now what is
- [24:23] this going to have access to? Well, you
- [24:25] can always click add context to see what
- [24:27] information you have access to when
- [24:29] working with all these different nodes.
- [24:31] So in our case down here in
- [24:32] hallucination, you can see we have
- [24:34] multiple different reasons or multiple
- [24:37] different fields we can access for
- [24:38] hallucination. So in our case, we can
- [24:40] access reasoning. So we can say in our
- [24:43] case, we can say the user's initial
- [24:45] query produced hallucinations.
- [24:48] Here is the initial query. And what we
- [24:50] can do is just once again always pass in
- [24:52] the initial query provided by the user.
- [24:55] And I know this might be a little tiny.
- [24:56] I apologize. The uh I guess we can zoom
- [24:58] back in again. So here's the initial
- [25:00] query. Then what we can do is say here
- [25:02] is the reason why the answer is not
- [25:07] valid.
- [25:09] Then what we can do is pass in
- [25:11] reasoning. And then what we can also do
- [25:13] is I think we can also access yeah we
- [25:15] actually can't access anything else but
- [25:17] we can also give it more information to
- [25:18] provide the hallucination type. Here is
- [25:21] the hallucination type as well. And what
- [25:25] we can do once again add context and we
- [25:27] can provide it right here. Hallucination
- [25:29] type. Okay. I think we're all good. So
- [25:32] let's actually try this out again. So
- [25:33] let's preview our agents. And at this
- [25:35] point we're just going to try and go
- [25:36] down the unsafe path. So we can say what
- [25:38] time did Brandon walk his dog yesterday?
- [25:41] And at this point, what's going to
- [25:42] happen is the rag agent is going to try
- [25:44] and search through all the vector stores
- [25:46] to see through all my coaching calls,
- [25:48] what time did I walk my dog. The short
- [25:50] answer is I never talked about that.
- [25:51] That's not the whole point of this
- [25:52] vector store. So, this should trigger as
- [25:55] a failure where the guardrail goes, hey,
- [25:57] you know, there's not anything
- [25:59] mentioning it. So, the guardrail should
- [26:02] basically say, hey, no, you don't have
- [26:04] this information. This is not valid. So,
- [26:07] you can see the guardrail failed. So,
- [26:09] failed. That's perfect. That's what we
- [26:10] wanted it to do. And it's saying here
- [26:12] was the input which is what time of
- [26:14] brain walk his dog. Then it's going to
- [26:16] say exactly what went wrong. So the
- [26:19] hallucination reasoning is like hey the
- [26:21] user is asking about walking the dog but
- [26:23] the documents never mention in any
- [26:25] information about his dogs. Therefore
- [26:27] the factual claim or any questions is
- [26:29] going to be unsupported. So it's an
- [26:30] unsupported claim for whatever answer.
- [26:32] You know we can't actually answer a
- [26:34] question about this because we don't
- [26:35] have information about it. So, the
- [26:37] unsafe agent answers and it's saying,
- [26:38] "Hey, I don't see any information in the
- [26:40] uploaded coaching call transcripts. I
- [26:42] only talk about a dog one time as a
- [26:45] general example, but I never talk about
- [26:46] walking my dogs." So, that's pretty
- [26:48] cool. Like, that's like adding in
- [26:49] guardrails like that is normally such a
- [26:51] pain, but with working with basically
- [26:54] agent kit, it took 2 seconds and we set
- [26:56] that up. All right. So, here's what we
- [26:58] can do now. I want us to start working
- [27:00] on showcasing some of the cooler
- [27:02] features of working with agent kit and
- [27:06] chatkit. So this is where we're going to
- [27:08] start working with actually
- [27:09] incorporating and publishing this agent
- [27:11] right here and actually having it so
- [27:13] that we can actually add it to an
- [27:15] next.js application. So that's part one.
- [27:16] And then part two, I'm going to show you
- [27:18] how you can start adding in custom forms
- [27:19] and outputs and UIs. It's crazy how easy
- [27:22] it is for all this to work. So let's hop
- [27:24] over to a Nex.js XJS application and
- [27:27] actually start hooking everything up cuz
- [27:28] it's stupid easy to do. So, I'll see you
- [27:30] in just a second. All right, so welcome
- [27:31] to the chat kit starter template. This
- [27:34] was generated and built by OpenAI and
- [27:37] it's something that you guys can access.
- [27:39] I'll have a link to all the resources
- [27:40] and a link down description below so you
- [27:42] can get links to this template so you
- [27:44] can download it yourself. But what the
- [27:45] heck is this template actually doing?
- [27:47] Well, at the end of the day, it's
- [27:49] installing all the necessary packages
- [27:50] for us to start working with chatkit,
- [27:54] which is, you know, the basically the
- [27:56] file and the library that allows us to
- [27:59] bring in all the cool agent workflows.
- [28:00] And actually, Adam has a really nice UI
- [28:02] in our next JS application. So, let's
- [28:04] just run this bad boy so you can see how
- [28:06] easy it is to actually talk with your
- [28:08] agent workflows. Now, here's exactly
- [28:10] what you need to do to get it working.
- [28:12] Whenever you download the OpenAI Chatkit
- [28:14] starter app, there's two things you have
- [28:16] to change. That's literally it. You have
- [28:17] to add in your public workflow ID. I'll
- [28:20] show you how to get that. And you need
- [28:21] to go get an OpenAI key. You guys are
- [28:23] smart. You know how to do that. So, how
- [28:24] do we get this workflow ID? Well, all
- [28:27] you have to do is publish your
- [28:28] application. It's as simple as that. So,
- [28:30] in the top right, you're going to click
- [28:31] publish. As soon as you click publish,
- [28:34] you are going to name your workflow. In
- [28:36] our case, it's Rag Coaching. And we're
- [28:38] going to click publish. Once this is
- [28:39] published, it's going to go ta. And you
- [28:41] can see in the top left that we can
- [28:43] actually version it and everything,
- [28:44] which is crazy. But what should happen
- [28:46] to actually work with your agent is at
- [28:49] the very end to get your workflow ID,
- [28:51] you have to click code. Once you click
- [28:53] code, all you have to do is grab this
- [28:56] workflow ID right here inside of
- [28:58] chatkit. And what is pretty cool, you
- [29:01] can see under the hood that like I
- [29:03] mentioned at the very beginning of this
- [29:05] video, you know, agent builder, the tool
- [29:07] that we're using is nothing more than a
- [29:09] nice UI to have us build on top of agent
- [29:12] SDK. So you can see in here at the end
- [29:14] of the day, this is all just Python code
- [29:16] where we have guardrails, we have our
- [29:18] specific, you know, fire search tool
- [29:19] where we're looking up our vector store.
- [29:21] So at the end of the day, this is all
- [29:22] code. It's just we have a really nice UI
- [29:24] that's sitting on top of it. So we can
- [29:26] go to chatkit. Now once we're inside
- [29:28] chatkit, we want to copy this workflow
- [29:29] ID. So just click copy. Now when we hop
- [29:32] back over to our code, so let's go find
- [29:35] our code really quick. All we have to do
- [29:38] is update this workflow ID right here.
- [29:41] Save it. and you guys will go and
- [29:43] generate your OpenAI key. But the second
- [29:45] that's done, all you have to do is run
- [29:48] MPMI to install all the necessary
- [29:50] packages. And then as soon as you're
- [29:52] done with that, run dev. Now, this is
- [29:54] going to go spin up our application on
- [29:55] port 3000. So, let's go take this bad
- [29:58] boy for a run. So, localhost 3000. And
- [30:01] you can see, tada, loading our agent.
- [30:03] Now, this agent is hooked up to our rag
- [30:06] agent. So we can once again say, you
- [30:08] know, what time was Brandon's latest
- [30:11] coaching call? What date? At this point,
- [30:13] it's going to then go perform the normal
- [30:16] rag query that was always happening
- [30:18] inside of like you just saw in the
- [30:20] preview, except now it's happening in
- [30:22] production. Like it's crazy how easy it
- [30:23] is from preview to production and it all
- [30:26] works. So at this point, it's generating
- [30:27] response. It's thinking and in just a
- [30:30] second it should generate the result to
- [30:31] say, "Oh, I can see that Brandon's
- [30:33] coaching call happened on October 7th,
- [30:36] today." and it took place at this time
- [30:38] and you know here's what was happening
- [30:40] and you can ask follow-up questions.
- [30:41] What were some of the main topics talked
- [30:43] about during this coaching call and you
- [30:46] can see what is always super nice is you
- [30:48] can kind of see which files that it
- [30:50] referenced when building out this
- [30:51] answer. So it it had to look at a few
- [30:53] different sources to actually you know
- [30:55] basically call this out. So we're now
- [30:57] going to have it send that second
- [30:58] request and like this is rag. This is
- [31:01] real world rag happening in just in
- [31:03] seconds. This is crazy. Now, the second
- [31:06] this is done, so you can see it's doing
- [31:07] its normal thinking and everything. As
- [31:08] soon as this just generates a result,
- [31:10] well, while it's generating a result, I
- [31:12] actually show you guys some some cooler
- [31:13] things. So, not only are you guys
- [31:15] getting access to agent builder, but you
- [31:17] also have logs. Now, in logs, what you
- [31:20] can do is actually view what the heck
- [31:22] happened inside of these calls. So, you
- [31:24] can go to chatkit threads, and inside
- [31:28] here, you can actually see everything
- [31:30] that we are talking about. So, you can
- [31:31] click here and quickly see what was
- [31:34] going on. So you can see Brandon asked
- [31:36] or I asked what time was Brandon's
- [31:38] coaching call. Now what's happening
- [31:40] under the hood is it generated all sorts
- [31:43] of agent calls to do different assistant
- [31:46] messages where this assistant message
- [31:48] called these different files and it
- [31:50] generated you know a response which was
- [31:52] like hey Brandon's latest coaching call
- [31:54] was here. What you could also do if you
- [31:56] wanted to go deeper is you could go into
- [31:58] a trace. And a trace, what you could do
- [32:00] is look at, all right, what workflow are
- [32:03] we working with? In this case, we're
- [32:05] working with, you know, this chat
- [32:07] conversation right here. This is what
- [32:09] we're working with. And you can actually
- [32:10] go look at a trace to where you can see
- [32:12] what exactly happened. So you can see we
- [32:15] kicked off the agent where Brandon, we
- [32:18] asked what time was Bran's latest
- [32:19] coaching call. So you can see exactly
- [32:21] what happened. Next is our rag query
- [32:23] agent then kicked off an entire result
- [32:26] to where it was generating a response.
- [32:29] Inside this response, you can see
- [32:30] exactly what was happening. The
- [32:32] configurations, you can see the system
- [32:34] instructions, which is exactly what we
- [32:36] set up initially when we were creating
- [32:37] the agent. You can see the input, you
- [32:39] can see everything. It is crazy that all
- [32:41] this is already built out for us. And
- [32:43] then now you can see I asked a second
- [32:45] question and that this is in progress.
- [32:46] Like the fact that we can do all of this
- [32:49] right out the box in seconds is is
- [32:51] crazy. only this on a ton of other
- [32:52] frameworks. This takes forever to get to
- [32:54] this point and you have to pay a ton of
- [32:56] money between either bringing in your
- [32:58] own thirdparty tracing capabilities or
- [33:01] setting it up yourself. Like, and this
- [33:03] just works right out the gate, which is
- [33:04] crazy. So, hopping back over here, you
- [33:06] can see, oh, well, if you're referring
- [33:08] to October 7th, we were in the
- [33:10] conversation in the coaching call
- [33:12] talking about working with different
- [33:13] agent platforms, rag platforms, working
- [33:16] with chat SAS applications, like we were
- [33:18] talking about all the different, you
- [33:19] know, products and everything inside of
- [33:21] Shipkit, one of the projects that I
- [33:23] built for you guys. So, what else you
- [33:25] can kind of see hopping over here. So,
- [33:26] we'll just refresh this. So, it's done.
- [33:28] Yeah, it should be done with in
- [33:30] progress. Not sure why it's still saying
- [33:32] it's going, but what's really cool now
- [33:34] is I just want to hop to one of the very
- [33:36] final features that you guys need to see
- [33:38] about agent builder, which is you can
- [33:40] start to actually generate some really
- [33:42] cool forms. So, up to this point, every
- [33:45] time we've generated a response, it's
- [33:47] just been plain text. Hey, that's cool.
- [33:49] But like, man, we can do so much more.
- [33:51] So, let me actually show you what else
- [33:52] you can do. So, at this point,
- [33:54] everything we've done is a output format
- [33:56] of text. Well, what we could also do is
- [33:58] use chat kit. what you can see right
- [34:00] here, which is to build a widget. Now,
- [34:03] inside of this widget, what we can do is
- [34:06] click add widget, and it's going to ask
- [34:08] us to create a brand new widget. And
- [34:10] what a widget's going to do is it's
- [34:12] going to be a really nice UI element
- [34:14] that's custom, and the agent is going to
- [34:16] know exactly how to fill out this nice
- [34:18] UI to actually make it look really cool.
- [34:20] So, let's let's just go do it so you can
- [34:21] see it in action. So, at this point,
- [34:23] we're going to say, can you please
- [34:25] create a really clean, simplistic UI
- [34:28] element that will contain the search
- [34:32] results from a rag agent. So, all we
- [34:35] need to have is a nice header and a
- [34:38] body. That is all we need. Make it
- [34:39] clean, minimal for our users. Now,
- [34:42] what's really cool is this create widget
- [34:45] application is going to go, "All right,
- [34:47] cool. I'm going to now make you a
- [34:49] widget." And it'll make the most sense
- [34:51] as soon as you see it here in a second.
- [34:53] But what it's planning on doing is like,
- [34:54] oh, you said you wanted a header and you
- [34:57] wanted so header up top. So header and
- [35:00] then over here you wanted body. Well,
- [35:01] the agent's going to start working on
- [35:03] creating that nice UI element. And
- [35:05] what's really cool is at the bottom once
- [35:07] it generates this new widget is it's
- [35:09] going to say, "Hey, in order for me to
- [35:12] showcase this agent, here's exactly what
- [35:14] I need. I need a header input and I need
- [35:17] a body." So, what we can do, this is
- [35:20] super minimalistic. We could actually
- [35:21] make this fancier if we wanted to, but I
- [35:23] just want to we'll we'll download it. As
- [35:26] soon as we download it, we can click
- [35:27] upload. We'll go to downloads and we'll
- [35:30] do rag search widget. So, you can see,
- [35:32] tada, we now have a widget. So, this is
- [35:35] what's going to be used to generate our
- [35:37] final result. So, let's actually just
- [35:39] see this in action because it's really,
- [35:41] really cool. So, we'll actually publish
- [35:43] this at the same time, too. So, let's
- [35:46] see this in action. So, we're going to
- [35:47] say, can you please tell me what is the
- [35:50] chat SAS application? So, at this point,
- [35:53] I'm going to pass in a query to our
- [35:56] vector store once again, and hopefully
- [35:58] Whisper can generate the result. One
- [36:00] second. Perfect. So, now we're going to
- [36:01] send this off. Now, what this is going
- [36:03] to do is perform the typical rag search,
- [36:06] then do guardrails, then it's going to
- [36:08] trigger our result agent, and our result
- [36:10] agent is going to then put the final
- [36:12] result in that really cool chat widget.
- [36:15] Obviously, we went super simple for this
- [36:16] demo, but we could have made it look
- [36:19] really, really pretty and clean. And I'm
- [36:21] going to show you here in the preview
- [36:22] land. And then we're going to hop over
- [36:23] actually to our Next.js application. So,
- [36:25] you can see just how easy it is to build
- [36:27] nice UI elements here and then actually
- [36:29] have them appear inside of our real
- [36:31] world next.js application. So, you can
- [36:33] see our guardrails are running really
- [36:35] quickly. And, you know, guardrails are
- [36:37] going to say yes hopefully here in a
- [36:39] second of like yes, this is a pass. So,
- [36:41] we're going to give this a second. And
- [36:43] real quick, if you guys ever get that
- [36:45] error up top, that's one of the worst
- [36:47] parts about working with new
- [36:48] technologies is sometimes they fail. So
- [36:50] in our case, we're just going to have to
- [36:51] run it again. But yeah, this is the
- [36:54] current agent kit and agent builder. I'm
- [36:56] going to give it like an 80% reliability
- [36:58] right now. I think as time goes on,
- [37:00] it'll become obviously more reliable,
- [37:01] but you're just going to see sometimes
- [37:03] the agent will kind of basically crap
- [37:05] out for and it doesn't really tell you
- [37:07] why. It just says we've lost hold of the
- [37:09] thread. So, we're going to let this go
- [37:11] for a second while it's trying to think
- [37:13] of an answer. It's looking through all
- [37:15] of the different coaching calls to
- [37:16] figure out like, oh, what is Shipkit?
- [37:18] And quick call to plug Shipkit. So, this
- [37:21] is the tool that I built for you guys.
- [37:23] It's a combination of course pre-built
- [37:24] real world AI applications and
- [37:26] everything that you guys need to do to
- [37:28] build realworld AI applications. And
- [37:31] definitely recommend checking out this
- [37:32] video so you can see all the cool things
- [37:33] that you guys get inside of Shipkit. But
- [37:35] basically, you can really build a new AI
- [37:38] application in days using Shipkit. So,
- [37:41] we have courses to walk you through
- [37:43] everything, pre-built projects to walk
- [37:44] you through everything. And one of the
- [37:46] coolest things is we have different
- [37:48] prompt templates inside the course that
- [37:49] they do all the work for you. Oh, you
- [37:51] want to come up with a new landing page?
- [37:52] Boom, we did that. Oh, you want to build
- [37:53] new functionality? Cool. We'll literally
- [37:55] help you do all of that. It's the first
- [37:56] true AI course, and you'll see all of it
- [37:58] in action inside of that video. But
- [38:00] enough of that. Let's actually hop back
- [38:02] to working with this to where we're
- [38:04] having our guard rails wrap up and we're
- [38:07] having it finish. One second.
- [38:10] Yeah. And for some reason it keeps it
- [38:12] keeps dying. So I'm just going to run
- [38:13] this a bunch of times in the background
- [38:14] until it works for you guys so I can
- [38:15] show the final result. So one second and
- [38:17] I will show you the final result and
- [38:18] then we'll hop over to Next.js. All
- [38:20] right. So I ran it again and it worked
- [38:22] perfectly. So as you can see now instead
- [38:24] of just returning text like everything
- [38:26] above where we used to return text, now
- [38:28] what we're doing is returning our cool
- [38:30] widget. And obviously this is insanely
- [38:31] plain. We could all we're doing is a
- [38:33] header and a body, but we could add so
- [38:35] much more to this. We could make it do a
- [38:36] cool table. We could make it add a ton
- [38:38] of colors. Like there's a thousand cool
- [38:40] things that you can do when it comes to
- [38:42] adding widgets. And as you can see, it
- [38:44] basically just followed the, you know,
- [38:45] the basic format that we were asking
- [38:46] for. Now, what's also really cool is at
- [38:48] the exact same time, I asked the same
- [38:50] question over to our Next.js
- [38:51] application. And you can see it returned
- [38:54] with, you know, all of its thoughts. you
- [38:56] can see right here and a cool little
- [38:57] answer, but at the very end, it returned
- [38:59] the widget. And the widget is the exact
- [39:01] same thing that you saw earlier where
- [39:03] it's returning an answer and so forth.
- [39:06] But what's also really cool is if you
- [39:07] wanted to, you could add actions at the
- [39:09] end like a copy button. You could add a
- [39:11] send button. You could do all of that.
- [39:12] And how would you do it? Well, just
- [39:14] going back over here, you would hop back
- [39:16] over to agent builder. Inside of our
- [39:19] agent, we would just make a brand new
- [39:20] widget. So, we would actually get rid of
- [39:22] this widget. We would detach. We would
- [39:24] create a new one. And then what we could
- [39:26] do just once again go through the
- [39:28] process of making a more colorful one.
- [39:29] Maybe add tables. We could do everything
- [39:31] inside of here. Heck, you could even,
- [39:33] you know, put this in back in, upload
- [39:35] the widget, and basically start to to
- [39:37] work on it yourself. Obviously, the
- [39:39] coolest part is to use AI out the out
- [39:41] the gate. But these are just examples of
- [39:44] what really cool widgets could look
- [39:45] like. So, you could add a weather
- [39:47] widget. You could add a to-do calendar
- [39:49] widget where actions are at the bottom.
- [39:51] So you could add any of this and it
- [39:52] takes literally seconds to build out
- [39:54] these custom ones. Heck, you could even
- [39:56] click on one and you can see the exact
- [39:58] source code and you can make this be
- [40:00] your widget. So there's a thousand
- [40:02] things that you could do inside of here.
- [40:03] But I just wanted to show you guys today
- [40:05] a little bit of what is possible with
- [40:07] using Agent Kit. But yeah guys, that's a
- [40:09] wrap for this video today. I hope you
- [40:11] guys love seeing the biggest update of
- [40:14] the OpenAI dev day where you guys got to
- [40:16] learn everything about agent kit and all
- [40:19] of the cool new components inside of it
- [40:21] such as agent builder chatkit. There's
- [40:23] so many cool new features that have made
- [40:25] it so much easier to deploy real world
- [40:28] AI agents. If you have questions on
- [40:29] anything, feel free to drop a comment
- [40:31] down below. Always super happy to help.
- [40:33] And also just a quick reminder, you can
- [40:35] download the link down description below
- [40:37] and it'll have resources to all of the
- [40:39] different transcripts. It'll have links
- [40:40] to some of the different resources I use
- [40:42] and everything else you need to
- [40:43] replicate this on your own. But yeah,
- [40:44] thanks guys. Can't wait to see you in
- [40:46] the next video. Hope you have a great
- [40:46] day. Talk to you soon. See you.
