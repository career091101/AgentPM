- [00:00] My name is David Andre and in this video
- [00:01] I'll show you how to create any NA10
- [00:03] workflow using cloth code. If you aren't
- [00:06] using these tools, you're actually
- [00:08] falling behind because I'll show you how
- [00:09] to literally type in plain English and
- [00:11] get full working automations as an
- [00:13] output. And no, you don't have to be a
- [00:15] programmer. So the first step is to open
- [00:17] cursor or any code editor, VS Code,
- [00:20] doesn't matter, and open a folder. So
- [00:21] here I prepared a folder that's
- [00:22] basically empty except I have two prompt
- [00:24] files which I'll show you in a bit. But
- [00:26] the first thing you have to do is open
- [00:28] cloud code. If you don't have cloud code
- [00:29] installed, just run this command in any
- [00:31] terminal. This will install cloud code
- [00:33] on your entire machine. Just make sure
- [00:35] you have NodeJS 18 or plus installed.
- [00:37] That's literally all you need. So, let's
- [00:39] jump back into cloth code and let's get
- [00:41] started on the first prompt. So, I'm
- [00:42] going to say build prompt number one.
- [00:44] Complete it fully and I'm going to turn
- [00:46] it into auto accept mode. Now, the first
- [00:48] prompt, this is like the beginner way of
- [00:49] how to create JSON files that then you
- [00:51] can import into NA10. Later though, I'll
- [00:53] show you a much better way using MCPS
- [00:56] that creates reliable proven automations
- [00:58] that follow the latest documentation and
- [01:00] that cloth code can test by itself to
- [01:02] ensure everything is correct. By the
- [01:03] way, if you want to pause and read
- [01:05] through the prompt, feel free to do that
- [01:06] right now. So, basically what we're
- [01:07] building is going to be like advanced
- [01:09] calendar optimizer agent. Cloud code has
- [01:12] finished writing the JSON file. Boom.
- [01:14] So, this is the whole JSON file that we
- [01:16] can just import into NA10 with one
- [01:18] click. So, let me show you how to do
- [01:19] that. So inside of your NA10, click on
- [01:21] create workflow in the top right and
- [01:22] then click on the three dots and then
- [01:25] import from file. Locate the file that
- [01:27] Cloud Code just created and boom,
- [01:29] there's the automation. Now you can see
- [01:30] there's multiple issues, right? Number
- [01:32] one, these two are like not configured
- [01:34] at all. So that is a huge fail from
- [01:37] cloud code. Number two, this is not a
- [01:39] tool. This is just a HTTP node inside of
- [01:41] NA10. Basically, this automation is
- [01:43] quite incomplete and it would still
- [01:45] require a bunch of your time to go
- [01:47] through it, fix it up, and correct it.
- [01:48] So that's why I'm going to show you a
- [01:50] much better way that uses MCPS to build
- [01:53] full NA10 agents. So what we need to do
- [01:55] is jump back into cursor and create a
- [01:57] new file called MCP.json. This is going
- [02:00] to be the list of MCPS available to
- [02:02] cloud code. Now I found this really
- [02:04] solid MCP for NA10. It's not official,
- [02:07] so use it at your own risk. It is by far
- [02:09] the easiest way to build NA10
- [02:11] automations. Luckily, the setup here is
- [02:12] super simple. There's literally just two
- [02:14] steps. What you need to do is copy this
- [02:16] command right here. npxnat mcp. Then
- [02:19] jump back into cursor or whatever code
- [02:21] editor you're using and then just paste
- [02:23] this into a terminal. That's it. npx n10
- [02:26] mcp and it will activate this mcp
- [02:28] server. So this is the first step
- [02:29] already done. Yes, it's that easy. So
- [02:31] let's jump back into this GitHub repo.
- [02:32] And by the way, I'll link this below the
- [02:34] video as well. And the next step is
- [02:36] copying this basic configuration.
- [02:37] Literally just copy it. No need to
- [02:39] change anything. And then paste it into
- [02:41] the mcp.json file we have created a few
- [02:44] seconds ago. Save it. command S or
- [02:46] control S. Next, we have to create a new
- [02:48] cloth code because if we go into the old
- [02:50] one and we type in /mcp, it doesn't have
- [02:52] any MCPS configured. But if we create a
- [02:54] new cloth code, we will see that it's
- [02:56] asking us new MCP server found in
- [02:58] MCP.json the NA10 MCP, right? And we
- [03:01] have three options. Use this and all
- [03:02] future MCPS use this MCP server. So, I'm
- [03:04] going to enter to give it approval. And
- [03:06] then if we type in /mcp, we can see this
- [03:09] is configured correctly. So now clot
- [03:11] code can actually use this MCP to build
- [03:13] the full automation for us. So I'm going
- [03:15] to switch cloth code to auto accept mode
- [03:17] which you can do by pressing shift tab
- [03:19] keyboard shortcut. And then I'm going to
- [03:21] say follow prompt number two. Build it
- [03:25] completely. Boom. Enter. And we're going
- [03:27] to have it running. So now cloth code is
- [03:29] running on the second prompt using the
- [03:31] MCP tools. And it's going to build an
- [03:33] automation that's 10 times better
- [03:34] because this is honestly a mess. Like
- [03:36] this is not bad, right? It's better than
- [03:38] nothing. But I promise once you see the
- [03:39] output of what cloud code can do with
- [03:41] that MCB tool, you'll be amazed. Now,
- [03:43] while it's running, you might be
- [03:44] thinking, okay, but David, where do you
- [03:46] host these? Right? Because any NA10
- [03:48] automation or agent you build has to be
- [03:50] hosted somewhere. And personally, all of
- [03:51] my NA10 automations or agents are hosted
- [03:54] on Hostinger. Why? Because you get
- [03:56] unlimited amount of workflows. So unlike
- [03:58] other providers, they limit the amount
- [03:59] of agents you can build. Hostinger
- [04:01] doesn't do that. Plus, you get unlimited
- [04:03] executions. So, if your agent needs to
- [04:05] be running 24/7 thousands of times,
- [04:08] that's completely fine because with
- [04:09] Hostinger, you get a VPS server. So,
- [04:11] this is what me and my team use to host
- [04:13] all of our NA10 agents we built, and
- [04:15] it's what you should use as well. So,
- [04:16] let me show you how to set it up. If you
- [04:18] get the KVM2 plan, which I would
- [04:20] recommend you to get, you can literally
- [04:21] run hundreds of AI agents on this plan,
- [04:23] and it will cost you way less than if
- [04:25] you used the NA10 Cloud, especially if
- [04:27] you go with the 24 month option, which I
- [04:29] definitely recommend you do because you
- [04:31] want your AI agents running forever. You
- [04:33] build them once and they save you time
- [04:34] in perpetuity. And since Hostinger was
- [04:36] kind enough to sponsor this video, if
- [04:38] you use the coupon code David, you will
- [04:40] save additional 10% off on your annual
- [04:43] or 2-year plan. Then what remains is
- [04:45] selecting the server location. So just
- [04:47] select whatever is closest to you. I'm
- [04:48] in Czech Republic, so Germany is super
- [04:50] close. And then for the operating
- [04:52] system, click on NA10. They literally
- [04:54] have a one-click install template for
- [04:55] NA10. It couldn't be any easier. So
- [04:57] click on confirm and then click on
- [04:59] continue and log in with your hosting
- [05:00] account or just create one. And the last
- [05:02] thing that remains is filling out your
- [05:04] billing details and your credit card.
- [05:05] I've been using Hostinger for months to
- [05:07] host my internet agents. And it really
- [05:09] is the simplest and most affordable way
- [05:11] to do so. So again, make sure to check
- [05:13] out the link description and remember to
- [05:14] use code David to get 10% off. All
- [05:17] right. So once you have your Hostinger
- [05:18] VPS, go to the panel, click on home, and
- [05:21] select manage. Here we can see how our
- [05:23] virtual private server is running and
- [05:25] all the usage you see about it. So this
- [05:27] is another advantage over the N10 cloud.
- [05:30] You can actually see this data that NAN
- [05:32] otherwise wouldn't give you. So all we
- [05:34] need to click is manage app and this
- [05:36] will launch the NA10 server where we can
- [05:38] see all of our AI agents. All right,
- [05:39] let's jump back into cloud code and let
- [05:41] me show you what prompt number two is.
- [05:42] Again, feel free to pause the video and
- [05:44] copy it for yourself, but basically it's
- [05:46] the description of the same build idea,
- [05:48] right? The ultimate calendar manager
- [05:50] agent that optimizes your time to work
- [05:52] on the highest leverage tasks to fill in
- [05:54] the gaps in your calendar. So it
- [05:56] describes the trigger, it describes the
- [05:57] necessary nodes, but this time it tells
- [05:59] it to use the MCP. So this makes it way
- [06:02] more reliable, not even close. So as you
- [06:04] can see, cloud code starts by using the
- [06:06] search nodes for these nodes to get the
- [06:08] official documentation for all of them.
- [06:11] So I need to do yes and don't ask again.
- [06:13] By the way, this will cause it to create
- [06:15] a new file settings.json.local
- [06:17] inside of the cloth folder with a list
- [06:20] of the permissions, right? So then these
- [06:22] commands search nodes they can run
- [06:24] automatically. They no longer need my
- [06:26] approval every single time that cloud
- [06:28] code wants to run this MCP tool. Why?
- [06:30] Because it's a safe tool, right? So
- [06:32] again this is a new command get node
- [06:34] essentials another safe command. So I'm
- [06:36] going to say yes and don't ask again.
- [06:38] And if we check the settings JSON local
- [06:40] we can see that right here it has been
- [06:41] updated to include this tool as well. So
- [06:43] now if we look at how cloud core is
- [06:45] working instead of just basically zero
- [06:47] shorting some JSON that might work or
- [06:49] might not work but as we saw earlier
- [06:51] it's still you know pretty unfinished
- [06:52] disconnected tools not good not good
- [06:55] this is better than nothing but we can
- [06:56] do a lot better instead of doing all
- [06:58] that cloth code uses this MCP server to
- [07:01] get the latest documentation on these
- [07:02] nodes right so first it actually finds
- [07:04] the official names of these nodes in the
- [07:07] NA10 docs then it uses get note
- [07:10] essential MCB tool to get the basic
- [07:13] input and structure of these nodes to
- [07:14] fully understand them just like an
- [07:16] expert N10 engineer would. So then it
- [07:18] repeats these steps for every single
- [07:20] node in the automation to fully
- [07:22] understand the scope of the project and
- [07:24] only then it tries to write and update
- [07:26] the workflow. Right? So here it found
- [07:28] out okay we already have the JSON file
- [07:30] but it needs significant improvements to
- [07:32] match the requirements and it's asking
- [07:34] if we can run the validate workflow
- [07:36] tool. Right? So what I did here is I
- [07:38] press escape to interrupt cloth code and
- [07:40] tell it ignore that JSON file, create a
- [07:41] new one because I don't want it to use
- [07:43] any of the bad practices from the
- [07:45] previous cloth code which created this
- [07:47] file because this one didn't have the
- [07:48] MCP, right? And honestly, it's a night
- [07:50] and day difference. Giving the MCP to
- [07:52] the cloth code makes it 10 times more
- [07:54] reliable. All right, so it seems like
- [07:56] the cloth code has finished running with
- [07:58] the MCP. Everything seems to be good.
- [08:00] Let's look at the JSON file. So this one
- [08:02] has 500 lines while the previous one
- [08:06] only has 385 lines. So it's already more
- [08:08] lines. But the real test is how it
- [08:11] actually looks in NA10. So let me create
- [08:12] a new one. New workflow. All right. So
- [08:14] there's a brand new empty workflow. And
- [08:17] again go to the top right, click on the
- [08:19] three dots, import from file, and then
- [08:21] let's find this new one. Telegram
- [08:23] calendar AI agent. There we go. Boom. So
- [08:26] you can immediately see a few
- [08:27] differences, right? So first of all, we
- [08:29] actually have the calendar events as
- [08:31] calendars. It's not some empty ghost
- [08:33] blocks. If we go to the previous one, we
- [08:34] can see that these are not even
- [08:35] configured, right? It's complete
- [08:37] disaster. Then the issue is that we have
- [08:39] the message model to transcribe the
- [08:41] voice. Instead of using this dedicated
- [08:43] node openi transcribe voice also in the
- [08:46] original one, the telegram trigger is
- [08:48] not even defined. This is just a chat.
- [08:50] This is a chat node inside of NA10. This
- [08:51] is not the telegram trigger node. While
- [08:53] in the new one, we can see that this is
- [08:55] correctly the telegram trigger. So what
- [08:57] remains is just connecting the
- [08:58] credentials so that it can work with my
- [09:00] own accounts. All right. So I wired up
- [09:01] my actual credentials so that we can use
- [09:03] it with my own accounts. Basically if
- [09:05] you already use NA10 this will take you
- [09:07] like 30 seconds. If you don't you need
- [09:09] to connect whatever nodes we have right.
- [09:10] So in this case telling trigger is the
- [09:12] first. Then we have the Google calendar
- [09:14] right that's a Google cloud console. I
- [09:16] already showed that in multiple videos
- [09:18] such as this one or this one. And
- [09:19] basically yeah maybe your openi API key
- [09:22] if you haven't connected that but it's
- [09:24] really straightforward. So let me just
- [09:25] walk you through all of it starting with
- [09:27] the trigger. So here you need to connect
- [09:28] your telegram account. So actually this
- [09:30] is very easy. All you need to do is
- [09:31] install the telegram desktop app. Open
- [09:33] the botfather and type in / newbot. It
- [09:36] will walk you through the steps of
- [09:38] creating a new telegram bot which you
- [09:39] then connect to n10. Again I've showed
- [09:41] that in many different videos. Or if you
- [09:43] get stuck at any point just jump back
- [09:44] into cloudcoin and say help me connect
- [09:47] the telegram bot into n10. Give me
- [09:51] step-by-step instructions. Since it has
- [09:53] the NA10 MCP tool, it basically knows
- [09:56] all of the documentation and it can tell
- [09:58] you exactly what to do. All right, so
- [10:00] cloud code is generating. This is going
- [10:01] to be very thorough instructions, by the
- [10:03] way. Boom. There we go. Over 1,000
- [10:05] tokens of instructions. You can honestly
- [10:07] say, "Give me a TLDDR cuz I didn't put
- [10:09] my signature prompt answering short."
- [10:11] But yeah, Cloth Code knows everything
- [10:13] basically. And it's a very powerful
- [10:15] agent that you should use. If you get
- [10:16] stuck at any point in this video, don't
- [10:18] get overwhelmed. Don't panic. Just ask
- [10:20] CL code. So here's the TDR. Step one,
- [10:23] create bot. Yeah, I showed you that. Add
- [10:24] the credentials, import workflow, set
- [10:26] web hook, test. Literally, it's that
- [10:29] simple. And again, these AI tools can
- [10:31] help you get unstuck. So maybe you
- [10:32] struggle with, I don't know, the
- [10:34] calendar tool or maybe the veil MCP,
- [10:36] which again I showed in this video. All
- [10:39] of this cloth code can help you and do
- [10:41] for you. Obviously, it doesn't have
- [10:42] login to your accounts. So that's why
- [10:44] connecting the credentials is the only
- [10:46] step you have to do manually. But as you
- [10:48] can see, it can build basically any
- [10:50] automation inside of NA10. It knows all
- [10:52] of the nodes. It knows all the tools. It
- [10:54] knows all the triggers. It knows all the
- [10:55] outputs. Oh, and one more thing I want
- [10:57] to show you is the prompt system prompt
- [10:59] for the AI agent, right? So, here it is.
- [11:01] And this was actually written by Cloore
- [11:02] as well. So, feel free to just take it
- [11:04] and steal it. And yeah, so let's test it
- [11:06] out. I'm going to execute workflow. And
- [11:09] it's waiting for me to create an event
- [11:10] in Telegram. So, let's jump back in. And
- [11:13] I have this guy right here. I'm going to
- [11:14] say find a task I can do in the next 30
- [11:18] minutes. So you can send this from your
- [11:20] phone. You can send this as a voice
- [11:21] note. Boom. There it is. So it instantly
- [11:23] uh found the message. It went into this
- [11:26] um true false check if it's a voice
- [11:28] message, right? If else basically. So if
- [11:30] it's not a voice message, so it went the
- [11:32] down route. If it was a voice message,
- [11:34] it would download the file, transcribe
- [11:35] it with OpenAI, and then set it manually
- [11:38] with the set note. Now it's going to
- [11:39] agent. The agent is using all these
- [11:41] tools and boom, there it is. Super fast.
- [11:43] So let me walk you through the tools
- [11:44] real quick. The calendar ones super
- [11:46] simple, right? Create event at Google
- [11:47] calendar or get many events to see where
- [11:49] the gaps are in your calendar and then
- [11:51] create the event where the gap is. The
- [11:53] vectoral one, this is the interesting
- [11:54] part, right? So hopefully you guys are
- [11:56] using vectal which is my tool for
- [11:58] managing your tasks. And this is the
- [12:00] most advanced AI tool. It tells you what
- [12:02] to actually work on, right? A lot of you
- [12:04] guys are actually working on the wrong
- [12:05] tasks. You might have a goal but you're
- [12:07] working on lowle leverage things. Vectal
- [12:09] since we use the cutting edge AI models,
- [12:10] it tells you the highest leverage task
- [12:12] possible that you should be doing to
- [12:14] achieve your goals. So this is why
- [12:15] Vectal is the best task manager on Earth
- [12:17] bar none. And that's why it pays off to
- [12:19] sit down for 10 to 15 minutes, move all
- [12:21] of your tasks from notion, to-d doist,
- [12:23] ClickUp into Vectal, and just forget
- [12:26] about these outdated task management
- [12:27] tools because this is what the future of
- [12:29] productivity looks like. Anyways, let's
- [12:30] jump back into NA10. So it used the
- [12:32] vectal tool to get a list of all of your
- [12:34] tasks and then figure out what can I do
- [12:37] in the next 30 minutes. as I said in the
- [12:38] message inside of Telegram. Okay, so I
- [12:40] have my calendar on the second screen.
- [12:42] There is some stuff I cannot show you,
- [12:44] but I'm going to take a screenshot.
- [12:45] Boom. So the red line represents the
- [12:47] current time, right? Basically now and
- [12:50] we have all of these different tasks
- [12:52] inside of vectal and I did a bunch of
- [12:54] testing so ignore these but let's focus
- [12:55] on the one that is in the next 30
- [12:57] minutes. Right? This is the new one it
- [12:58] created matching the prompt I sent into
- [13:00] the some task I can do in next 30
- [13:02] minutes. We have a bunch of bigger tasks
- [13:04] here, but the NA10 agent figured out
- [13:07] that out of everything else we have
- [13:09] inside of Ectel, this task, which is a
- [13:11] 15-minute task, can easily fit into this
- [13:14] 30-minute window that I described. And
- [13:15] so, that's exactly what it did. It
- [13:16] selected this task and it added it into
- [13:18] my Google calendar by itself. And I feel
- [13:20] like I need to stress this again. This
- [13:22] was built by cloth code. Like, I wasn't
- [13:24] adding any of these mods. It wasn't like
- [13:26] creating from scratch, building
- [13:28] manually, slowly, and any automation,
- [13:31] right? like we used to do six months
- [13:33] ago. No, Cloud Code now exists, guys.
- [13:35] And this is by far the easiest way to
- [13:37] build NA10 agents and NA10 automations.
- [13:39] So, forget about what anyone else is
- [13:41] telling you. Just use the NA10 MCP with
- [13:43] Cloud Code and start automating all of
- [13:46] the boring and repetitive tasks that you
- [13:47] have to do. And if you want to make sure
- [13:49] your AI agents are running 24/7 without
- [13:51] interruptions, make sure to get the VPS
- [13:53] from Hostinger. This is one of the most
- [13:55] affordable ways to host your NA10
- [13:57] automations. It's super simple to set
- [13:59] up. You literally saw it earlier and
- [14:00] it's what I use and my entire team uses
- [14:03] for everything we built on NA10. So
- [14:05] again, it's going to be the first link
- [14:06] below the video. Thank you Hostinger for
- [14:07] sponsoring this video and I hopefully
- [14:09] you guys enjoyed this tutorial. If you
- [14:11] did, make sure to subscribe and with
- [14:12] that being said, I wish you a wonderful
- [14:14] productive week. See you.
