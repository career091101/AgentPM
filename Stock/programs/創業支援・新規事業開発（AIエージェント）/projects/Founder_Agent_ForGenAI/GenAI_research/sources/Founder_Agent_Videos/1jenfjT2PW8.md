- [00:00] Today is going to be start off something
- [00:01] I have been wanting to try out for a
- [00:03] while and that is creating this trading
- [00:06] AI agent. Uh I've seen a lot of like
- [00:08] post and stuff about this. There is this
- [00:10] uh paper or some some kind of research
- [00:13] they are doing this now on um hyperlquid
- [00:16] with um with cryptocurrency. So I kind
- [00:19] of wanted to do my own version of this
- [00:21] and I probably will do a hyperlquid
- [00:24] version too. Uh but this is kind of the
- [00:26] setup. It's not the most advanced setup,
- [00:28] but I try to bring in context, find some
- [00:31] tickers with high volatility because
- [00:33] we're going to do CFD trading uh and
- [00:36] intraday. So, you can see uh how I set
- [00:40] this up is I'm going to run Cloud Code
- [00:42] as the agent and I built some MCP
- [00:45] servers. Uh one is kind of on Yahoo
- [00:47] Finance just to get the closing price
- [00:50] and um yeah, after market price for the
- [00:53] stocks. Uh we have an X MCP. So we can
- [00:57] look for sentiment on X also on Reddit.
- [01:00] Uh especially like on Wall Street Bets
- [01:03] and yeah other subreddits we can look at
- [01:06] sentiments. So the agent is going to be
- [01:09] kind of like a sentiment analysis and
- [01:12] try to pick tickers and stocks for us.
- [01:15] And it's also going to do kind of the
- [01:16] setup for the trade. I think uh
- [01:19] basically we use cloud code, we use the
- [01:22] tools we have. Uh I'm going to show you.
- [01:24] We have some more things we need in
- [01:25] place. I'm going to show you. But
- [01:27] basically, we use the MCP servers to
- [01:29] find the stocks with high volatility and
- [01:31] high sentiment. And based on this
- [01:34] context, we're going to ask the agent to
- [01:36] suggest some trades for us. So, we're
- [01:38] going to start off with $1,000. And
- [01:40] we're going to see uh at the end of the
- [01:43] week how much we have. So, today is just
- [01:45] going to be me explaining the agent,
- [01:47] showing how it works, and placing the
- [01:49] first trade. and I'm going to come back
- [01:51] at the end of the week with the
- [01:53] follow-up video. So, let's just head
- [01:55] over there. I'm going to show you a few
- [01:56] more things before we get this started.
- [01:58] So, another tool we use is apewisdom.io.
- [02:01] This is kind of tracking the trending
- [02:03] stocks on Reddit for the past 24 hours.
- [02:06] You can see we get ups, we get mentions,
- [02:08] and we get the tickers. So, I'm going to
- [02:11] do like top 15. This is going to be a
- [02:13] part of the context. And we have Swaggy
- [02:15] stocks. This is basically the same uh
- [02:18] but there's some more positive or
- [02:20] negative or neutral sentiment analysis
- [02:22] here. So we have gold beyond
- [02:26] uh meet I think AMD, Nvidia, Google,
- [02:29] right? Uh okay. So you can see these are
- [02:31] going to be in the context here. So I
- [02:34] have these two freshly screenshotted
- [02:37] from this page and we set up a workflow.
- [02:40] Uh so I have like this command here
- [02:42] structure. So this is the workflow we
- [02:44] do. We go from kind of yeah, you can see
- [02:47] we have a step one that's going to
- [02:48] review our trending data sources. We
- [02:50] have the two images I said, right? And
- [02:52] we're going to use a bash command to get
- [02:54] today's date. So, we kind of have that
- [02:56] up to speed. Uh read my account balance
- [02:58] that is going to be at $1,000 now,
- [03:01] right? And we're going to extract all
- [03:03] the tickers from the images we provided
- [03:05] up here. And yeah, that's basically it.
- [03:08] But we are going to avoid known mega
- [03:11] caps. So like Google, Apple, yeah,
- [03:14] Nvidia, like stuff like that because the
- [03:17] volatility is pretty low. So there's not
- [03:18] a lot of uh you can't make much money on
- [03:22] those CFDs because there's there's not
- [03:24] so much volatility. So we try to aim for
- [03:27] like smaller stocks that have more
- [03:29] volatility
- [03:31] uh especially these uh meme stocks.
- [03:34] Right. In our claw.md we also have like
- [03:36] you're a professional trader with
- [03:37] specialization in CFD trading. Your task
- [03:39] is to find trades based on sentimental
- [03:42] signals from Reddit, Twitter, other
- [03:44] sources. Our strategy is to leverage
- [03:46] volatility signals and blah blah blah.
- [03:48] It's pretty straightforward. So, we have
- [03:51] some strategies here we're going to
- [03:52] follow. If people are interested in
- [03:54] this, I can do another uh go through of
- [03:57] this, right? But basically, uh this is
- [03:59] kind of our simple setup. Uh we have our
- [04:02] MCP servers. So, if we head over to
- [04:04] cloned, right? And we do our MCP. Yeah,
- [04:07] there are some there are a couple of
- [04:09] servers here like the computer use we're
- [04:11] not going to use. So we going to use our
- [04:13] grock or X server. We're going to use
- [04:15] our Reddit server. The tools here are uh
- [04:18] search post, find trending post, search
- [04:20] by handles. And for the Reddit server,
- [04:23] we have the tools that is going to be
- [04:24] find post, get comments and we can
- [04:27] search for post and the finance
- [04:31] Yahoo finance tools are get quotes and
- [04:34] get the quote with a scraper just
- [04:36] because we need a real time um or
- [04:38] pre-market quote um ticker values too.
- [04:42] Uh yeah, those are the MCP servers we're
- [04:44] going to use. So basically I think we
- [04:46] are ready to run this now. So I guess we
- [04:49] can clear this and all we have to do is
- [04:51] just do our slash cfd command. So this
- [04:54] is going to start our workflow now. So
- [04:56] the first thing that's going to happen
- [04:57] now is just that uh we're going to do
- [05:00] the workflow we had in our command. So
- [05:03] we're going to read those images. We're
- [05:04] going to read our account balance,
- [05:06] right? And everything. We're going to
- [05:07] check out the date. And yeah, uh the
- [05:10] reason I picked clo for this is just
- [05:12] it's so good at doing like parallel tool
- [05:15] calls as you can see here. And just the
- [05:18] tool calling is just world class. It's
- [05:20] the best tool calling from all LLMs. And
- [05:24] that's why I want to use this. So you
- [05:26] can see what happened here. We had a
- [05:27] look at the images and we filtered out
- [05:30] some. So basically we filtered the small
- [05:32] cap u uh small midcap tickers. So we
- [05:36] have beyond me asset entities dragonfly
- [05:39] energies
- [05:42] am okay. uh Open Door, SoFi, Nebius.
- [05:47] Okay. And then we use the Yahoo Finance.
- [05:50] So, we're going to look at uh we use a
- [05:52] headless puppeteer here to screenshot
- [05:55] each ticker so we can get the pre-market
- [05:57] and the closed market price for all the
- [06:00] tickers we are interested in. And from
- [06:03] there, we're just going to keep doing
- [06:04] research. Okay. So, after some back and
- [06:06] forward, we kind of ended up on two
- [06:09] trades uh we are going to do or that I
- [06:12] did. Uh we ended up with uh Beyond Meat
- [06:15] and we're going to do a 5x leverage. Uh
- [06:18] I'm not going to do $2,000 exposure on
- [06:20] this because uh uh I I need to transfer
- [06:23] some more money. But basically, we are
- [06:25] starting with $800. And I'm going to do
- [06:28] an entry here for 1.9. And on the
- [06:31] Sophie, uh we're going to do the 2.5
- [06:33] leverage. We're going to do the entry at
- [06:35] 29.9,
- [06:38] I think. Right. And we have some tables.
- [06:41] We're going to follow the TR take profit
- [06:43] tables. But more importantly, the
- [06:45] stop-loss levels, right? So, we're going
- [06:48] to do if we enter beyond meat, we're
- [06:50] going to do 1.8 and 27.5.
- [06:54] And then we're just going to have to
- [06:55] wait and see what these trades give us.
- [06:57] So, uh I'm going to screen record my
- [06:59] phone. I'm going to show you the trades
- [07:01] we have done so far. Okay. So, you can
- [07:03] see this is the soi trade we did. You
- [07:05] can see we did a 29.98
- [07:08] opening price here. And if you look at
- [07:10] the stop loss, we're going to do 27.5.
- [07:13] And the takerit is just going to be as
- [07:15] high as it gets. I guess for the Beyond
- [07:18] Meat, this is at 2 uh if you go to
- [07:21] Beyond Meat, 2.08. Now, we're going to
- [07:23] do uh an entry price I think at 1.9 if
- [07:27] we go down there. Uh so that is
- [07:29] basically the strategy. I think it's a
- [07:31] very simple setup and I think it's just
- [07:32] a good start just trying to start to
- [07:35] explore with this. We have like $1,000.
- [07:37] It's not insane, but we're going to look
- [07:39] at the percentages I guess and just to
- [07:42] see what we can do with some small
- [07:44] leverage. Uh I'm going to build a
- [07:46] hyperlquid one too where we can do uh I
- [07:50] think we can they have a documentation
- [07:51] and an API I think so we can do a bit
- [07:54] more and set up maybe some more
- [07:56] autonomous trading because this is very
- [07:57] manual. It's uh yeah, basically based on
- [08:01] anal sentiment. So, I'm going to do a
- [08:04] hyperlquid one and I'm going to try to
- [08:06] make it into a series. So, I do like a
- [08:08] Monday, maybe like an update uh before
- [08:11] the week starts and then I'm going to do
- [08:13] like on Friday now after five trading
- [08:15] days. I'm going to do like a recap how
- [08:18] we did during the full week because it
- [08:20] doesn't take long to set up the trades
- [08:22] and close them out when we want to. So,
- [08:25] I'm probably going to do a hyperlquid
- [08:26] one uh for cryptocurrency and I'm going
- [08:28] to continue with this uh CFD uh trading
- [08:32] agents here with the setup we have. So,
- [08:36] this is an iteration process. So, I'm
- [08:37] going to try to improve it over time,
- [08:39] see what work, but doesn't maybe have
- [08:41] some more specific strategies we need.
- [08:44] So, yeah, hope you will enjoy this
- [08:46] series and let's see if we can make any
- [08:48] money. Um, I did make $50 last week when
- [08:52] I tried it out, but that was I think was
- [08:54] just bit basically luck. Uh, and I think
- [08:57] this is probably going to be a bit of a
- [08:59] luck, too. But, uh, maybe we find
- [09:01] something. Let's see. So, yeah. Thank
- [09:03] you for tuning in. Hope you come back on
- [09:05] Friday and have a great week.
