- [00:00] Vision AI agents are transforming
semiconductor manufacturing
- [00:05] operations, driving new levels
of quality and productivity.
- [00:11] At the die level, visual
inspection agents identify
- [00:14] defects more accurately
by fine-tuning vision foundation
- [00:19] models with labeled images
and now millions of unlabeled
- [00:23] images through self-supervised
learning and NVIDIA TAO.
- [00:28] At the wafer level, AI agents
powered by NVIDIA Metropolis
- [00:32] and Cosmos Reason identify defects
and reason potential root causes.
- [00:39] As manufacturing processes deviate
over time, agents can evaluate
- [00:44] lot level quality using videos
generated from the wafers in each
- [00:48] lot and highlight possible issues.
- [00:53] Interactive AI agents can also
train employees or monitor
- [00:57] for safety hazards and help
fleets of robots work efficiently
- [01:02] alongside workers.
- [01:05] NVIDIA Agentech AI is driving
the next generation of safer,
- [01:09] smarter manufacturing.
