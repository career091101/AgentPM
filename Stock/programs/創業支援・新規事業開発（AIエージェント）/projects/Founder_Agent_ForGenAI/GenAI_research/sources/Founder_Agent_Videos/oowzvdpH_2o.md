- [00:00] So, OpenAI just launched CHBD pulse and
- [00:02] it's actually insane. Well, it's a brand
- [00:04] new AI agent that works for you every
- [00:07] single day completely autonomously.
- [00:09] Basically, it turns CHBT from a passive
- [00:12] chatbot to an AI agent that's actually
- [00:15] proactive. In this video, I'll show you
- [00:17] what it does, how it works, and whether
- [00:19] it is worth the $200 a month. So, as of
- [00:22] today, Palace is only available on
- [00:24] mobile. So, make sure you install Chat
- [00:26] GBD on your phone. Now, when you open
- [00:27] the app, you can already see that in the
- [00:29] middle it says today's pulse. So,
- [00:31] they're really pushing this feature and
- [00:33] this is going to be one of the main
- [00:34] features inside of CH GBT. That is my
- [00:36] prediction. But you can also open it by
- [00:38] going to the left and clicking on pulse.
- [00:40] And this opens up your CHB pulse
- [00:42] overview for that day. Now, here is the
- [00:44] official announcement tweet from Sam
- [00:46] Ultman, the CEO of OpenAI. And by the
- [00:48] way, he does say that this is his
- [00:50] favorite feature of CHGBT. And I don't
- [00:52] think it's lying because this feature
- [00:54] it's really good. You'll see what I mean
- [00:56] in a bit. Anyways, Pulse works for you
- [00:58] overnight and keeps thinking about your
- [01:00] interests, your connected data, your
- [01:02] recent chats, and more. Every morning,
- [01:03] you get a custom generated set of stuff
- [01:05] you might be interested in. And let me
- [01:07] tell you, this is an understatement
- [01:08] because it really feels like pulse can
- [01:10] read your mind. It performs super well
- [01:12] if you tell CHBD more about what's
- [01:14] important to you. So, basically, when
- [01:16] chatting with it, tell it your current
- [01:17] goals. Tell it what problems you're
- [01:19] facing in your business or your life,
- [01:20] and it will use all of that context to
- [01:22] make pulse as good as possible. Here's
- [01:25] the next part of Sam Alman's tweet.
- [01:26] Think of treating Chad GBD like a super
- [01:28] competent personal assistant. Sometimes
- [01:30] you ask for things you need in the
- [01:32] moment, but if you share general
- [01:33] preferences, it will do a good job for
- [01:35] you proactively. And this is the main
- [01:37] thing, the first feature in the world
- [01:39] that's actually proactive, which means
- [01:41] it does stuff for you without you having
- [01:43] to ask. This also points to what I
- [01:45] believe is the future of CHIGBT, a shift
- [01:47] from being all reactive to being
- [01:50] significantly proactive and extremely
- [01:52] personalized. Let me show you an actual
- [01:54] example that kind of blew my mind. So
- [01:56] for context, few days ago, I asked JGBT
- [01:58] about which cities in Europe would be
- [02:00] the best to establish an in-person
- [02:02] office for vector, my startup. And it
- [02:05] was just a single chat. And look what
- [02:07] Pulse did with that information. So as
- [02:09] it says, you'll find this useful as
- [02:10] context when dealing with tech teams in
- [02:12] Poland. So Warso, the capital of Poland,
- [02:14] was one of the main cities I was
- [02:16] considering. and it used that context to
- [02:18] do detailed, deep research on what it's
- [02:22] like to hire in Poland and build a deaf
- [02:24] team. I didn't give it the instruction
- [02:26] to search for this. Now, I cannot stress
- [02:28] this enough. It might not seem
- [02:30] impressive to you because this is not
- [02:31] your problem. This is not something
- [02:32] you're thinking about, but this is hyper
- [02:34] relevant to me. So, when I read this, I
- [02:36] was like, "Wow, it literally predicted
- [02:38] what I was about to like search up or
- [02:40] research ahead of time." And by the way,
- [02:42] if you are a junior developer from
- [02:44] Europe and you might be interesting in
- [02:45] joining our Warsaw office, make sure to
- [02:47] apply. The link is going to be below the
- [02:49] video. Now, when I first saw this, the
- [02:50] first thought into my mind was how could
- [02:52] I build my own pulse? How could we build
- [02:55] a system like this? And actually
- [02:57] building something like change pulse is
- [02:59] much more doable than you think. The
- [03:00] biggest problem really is giving your AI
- [03:02] agent access to operate on the website
- [03:05] so that it can do the agentic proactive
- [03:07] behavior that you want it to do.
- [03:08] However, there's a solution that lets
- [03:10] you automate any actions in the browser
- [03:13] and give those powers to your AI agents.
- [03:15] And that solution is browserbased.
- [03:17] Browserbase lets you automate any
- [03:18] actions in the browser using natural
- [03:20] language. And it does so with stage
- [03:22] hand, which is their browser automation
- [03:24] framework. For example, you can run a
- [03:26] research agent to automate a task like
- [03:28] buy me a concert tickets for this artist
- [03:31] or you can use authenticated agent to
- [03:33] approve your teammates's pull requests
- [03:35] on GitHub. Now, creating these
- [03:36] automations is much easier than you
- [03:38] think because we can use director.ai to
- [03:40] do it for us. So, for example, I can
- [03:41] tell it, I want you to find me skilled
- [03:43] video editors on YouTube.co, navigate to
- [03:46] the talent section and filter categories
- [03:48] to video editors. So, this is an agentic
- [03:50] task and you can even watch it do the
- [03:52] automation for you. Like look at this.
- [03:54] It's opening the talent page, then it's
- [03:56] filtering by the categories, and you can
- [03:58] watch it work. Now, any automation you
- [03:59] create, just open it in playground, and
- [04:01] you can easily add it to your own
- [04:02] codebase. And on the left you can see
- [04:04] its thinking process. I notice I'm
- [04:06] currently on Google's homepage, not on
- [04:07] YouTube.co. Then it went to the website.
- [04:09] It clicked on the talent link and you
- [04:11] can see the reasoning it did after that.
- [04:13] Then it clicked on all categories and
- [04:15] it's creating the automation like that.
- [04:16] AI agent browsing the web in real time.
- [04:19] I mean the amount of potential startups
- [04:21] you can build with this is literally
- [04:23] endless. To try browser base yourself,
- [04:24] just use the link below the video. Thank
- [04:26] you to Browserbase for sponsoring this
- [04:28] video. All right, so let's look a bit
- [04:29] deeper on how Pulse actually works.
- [04:31] First off, it analyzes all of your
- [04:33] recent chats. So, if I had to guess,
- [04:34] probably like the re most recent 30 to
- [04:36] 60 days of your chbd conversations. Then
- [04:40] it groups that into five to seven most
- [04:43] important topics that you actually care
- [04:44] about. This could be your goals,
- [04:46] problems, things you are currently
- [04:48] learning, some things you might just be
- [04:50] interested in. And then it does
- [04:51] extensive deep research on those topics,
- [04:54] searching how to solve those problems,
- [04:56] best practices, any recent news.
- [04:58] Basically, it does a bunch of work for
- [05:00] you. Now, to give it even more context,
- [05:02] you can also connect apps like email and
- [05:04] calendar, which if you think into
- [05:06] future, it's going to be able to do
- [05:08] those actions, not just, you know, get
- [05:11] your calendar to see what you have for
- [05:12] the week. It's going to be able to
- [05:14] schedule slots, respond to emails. Yeah,
- [05:16] this could get real crazy real soon, but
- [05:18] more on that later. And then every
- [05:20] morning inside of your mobile app, you
- [05:22] will receive your pulse, you know, your
- [05:24] summary for the day with five to eight
- [05:26] personalized mini articles that are
- [05:29] hyper relevant to you. I really cannot
- [05:31] emphasize that enough. Pulse only really
- [05:33] is useful if you use CHP every day and
- [05:35] if you give it enough context. Now, why
- [05:38] did OpenAI put this on the CH GBD Pro
- [05:40] plan which cost $200 a month? And the
- [05:43] reason is JBD pulse burns a lot of
- [05:46] tokens both on reasoning about your
- [05:48] goals, your recent chats, your interests
- [05:51] and on the deep research part and
- [05:52] processing all those tokens from the
- [05:54] research. And this is exactly why it
- [05:57] feels so relevant to you. Like it
- [05:59] literally feels like it can read your
- [06:01] mind because it does so much reasoning
- [06:03] and so much thinking, so many tokens it
- [06:05] processes and all of that costs actual
- [06:08] money, right? Openi has to run the GPUs
- [06:10] and that cost them money. So, I do not
- [06:12] think this is just a ploy to get more
- [06:14] people to upgrade to the most expensive
- [06:16] plan. I actually think that currently
- [06:18] they cannot make it any cheaper. But
- [06:20] they did say, however, that they are
- [06:22] soon going to release it for the $20 a
- [06:24] month plan. Maybe it won't be as
- [06:26] expensive. But hey, if you have JBD
- [06:28] Plus, something to be excited for. Okay,
- [06:31] so let me actually show you what this
- [06:32] looks like in the app. So today, 26th
- [06:34] September, we have it in here. And you
- [06:36] can see it's a series of mini articles
- [06:39] with AI generated images which are
- [06:41] nicely complementing the article.
- [06:43] They're hyper relevant to me. So the
- [06:45] first one is fast flexible task
- [06:46] ordering. Right? I'm building a task
- [06:48] management application vectal and this
- [06:50] is highly relevant. Next up persistent
- [06:53] memory for AI agents. This is probably
- [06:54] something I researched recently. And
- [06:56] then after like three articles it asks
- [06:58] you for feedback and this is really the
- [07:00] true power of it, right? Because in
- [07:02] order for this to be useful every single
- [07:04] day, it needs to keep getting context
- [07:06] from your brain. So it's asking you
- [07:08] decide what shows up here. What's on
- [07:10] your mind lately? I'll remember it for
- [07:11] tomorrow's update. And you can tell it
- [07:13] anything, right? So like I'm trying to
- [07:15] scale my startup faster and this is my
- [07:17] bottleneck. Or I'm trying to lose weight
- [07:19] and I need to help building a diet. Or
- [07:21] I'm trying to hire a person for this
- [07:23] position. Whatever your goal is,
- [07:24] whatever problem you're facing in life,
- [07:26] give it that context and you'll be
- [07:28] surprised how much work it does behind
- [07:30] the scenes. So if I scroll deeper, we
- [07:31] can see more articles. Here's a way to
- [07:33] make strategy progress clearer for
- [07:34] teammates. So I was thinking of how to
- [07:37] scale my team and how to organize tasks.
- [07:39] Then I was asking something about
- [07:41] mermaid diagrams. So let me actually
- [07:43] click on this article to get more
- [07:44] details. And you can see these are like
- [07:45] hyper relevant articles based on your
- [07:48] recent searches. Consider this database
- [07:50] upgrade only if you're ready to test and
- [07:52] benchmark. So it gives you these like
- [07:54] summaries or actionable tips. It's not
- [07:57] just like bloat where it, you know,
- [07:58] browses the web and gives you like
- [08:00] irrelevant article. All of this is hyper
- [08:02] relevant to my recent search queries and
- [08:04] there's another input field. So, they're
- [08:06] really trying hard to get your faults
- [08:07] and really fine-tune how good this is.
- [08:09] Which of these software development
- [08:11] practices do you want more updates on
- [08:12] database performance, code review tools,
- [08:14] system design diagrams? I'm going to go
- [08:16] with system design. So, I clicked on
- [08:18] that and now it's it's sent out as a
- [08:21] feedback and ch response. Got it. Thanks
- [08:24] for letting me know. I'll bring more
- [08:25] focus on system designs for upcoming
- [08:26] updates. And this is how they ensure
- [08:28] it's useful every single day because if
- [08:30] you're not using CHBD daily, if you're
- [08:32] not giving it enough info, it has
- [08:34] nothing to reason about. Let's talk
- [08:35] resilience. Why relying on just one AI
- [08:37] model might be risky. Another article.
- [08:40] Here's a simple offline doc. So this is
- [08:41] interesting. I was on a flight recently
- [08:43] from Europe to Dubai and I was setting
- [08:46] up offline dogs for Python because I
- [08:47] wanted to program on the plane and
- [08:49] clearly I asked JGB about it and now it
- [08:52] tells me a simple way to set up local
- [08:54] dogs with PI do. I mean I just
- [08:56] downloaded the whole Python
- [08:58] documentation in HTML but that's fine.
- [09:00] And when you scroll down to the bottom
- [09:01] you can see that's all for today.
- [09:02] Thinking ahead what do you want to see?
- [09:03] And again you can provide more feedback
- [09:06] to CHVD pulse to make it even more
- [09:08] relevant. Now, this is just the
- [09:10] beginning because soon proactive AI
- [09:12] agents like this will be everywhere and
- [09:14] they'll become mega useful for your
- [09:16] calendar, for your email, for your
- [09:18] entire life because there will be more
- [09:20] and more integrations, right? More MCP
- [09:22] style tools, more protocols, more
- [09:24] frameworks that will enable the AI
- [09:26] agents to do even more stuff than they
- [09:28] can do today. The main bottleneck really
- [09:30] will be the connectors, the software
- [09:32] that makes all of this possible, the
- [09:34] glue, if you will, that allows the AI
- [09:35] agents to operate. And the exciting part
- [09:37] is that it's up to us, people like you
- [09:40] and me, to build this and to invent this
- [09:42] technology so that AI agents can really
- [09:44] change the world. Hopefully, you found
- [09:46] this video useful. If you did, make sure
- [09:47] to subscribe. And with that being said,
- [09:49] I wish you a wonderful, productive week.
- [09:50] See you.
