- [00:00] Hello all, my name is Krishna and
- [00:02] welcome to my YouTube channel. So guys,
- [00:04] uh just a day back OpenAI has definitely
- [00:08] made some of the amazing announcements
- [00:10] recently and uh in this specific video
- [00:13] I'm going to talk about that particular
- [00:14] announcements along with that uh one
- [00:17] specific announcement was related to
- [00:19] open AI toolkit. Uh now in this specific
- [00:22] video we'll see like how with the help
- [00:24] of OpenAI toolkit we can create agents,
- [00:27] we can automate workflows also. Okay. So
- [00:30] please make sure that you watch this
- [00:31] video till the end. Uh because this is
- [00:33] something really good announcement. So
- [00:35] that is the reason why I'm making this
- [00:36] specific video. So over here recently
- [00:39] you can see that open has also come up
- [00:41] with Sora 2. U here some of the demos
- [00:43] that I have actually seen along with
- [00:46] audios and videos. It is far much better
- [00:48] than Sora 1. Along with that open is
- [00:51] also coming up with something called as
- [00:53] introducing apps in chat GPT. Uh that
- [00:56] basically means uh if you're using chat
- [00:58] GPT you can use different kind of apps
- [01:01] uh apps such as uh you know booking.com
- [01:04] or Spotify or canva or figma and uh you
- [01:07] can directly communicate with that
- [01:08] particular app within your chat GPT
- [01:10] itself right and this is also one
- [01:13] amazing feature uh the best part about
- [01:15] this particular feature will be that in
- [01:16] the future let's say that if you are
- [01:18] creating your app and you really want to
- [01:20] integrate this in the chat GPT you also
- [01:23] get some kind of revenue sharing so this
- [01:25] is really really amazing in terms of
- [01:27] earning uh definitely for companies and
- [01:30] because at the end of the day you are
- [01:32] able to integrate even with chat GPT and
- [01:34] people are also using it in a very easy
- [01:36] way. Uh there are some very basic
- [01:38] guidelines how to create this particular
- [01:40] apps and all which you can definitely go
- [01:42] ahead and refer from the documentation.
- [01:44] Okay. So this was the another
- [01:46] announcements that you could see over
- [01:47] here. Uh as I said the most amazing
- [01:50] announcement was about uh agent toolkit.
- [01:54] Um now how do you go ahead and access
- [01:56] the agent toolkit with the help of agent
- [01:58] builder. So open AAI has actually come
- [02:00] up with something called as uh agent
- [02:02] builder. So if you go ahead and search
- [02:03] for open AI agent toolkit so here you'll
- [02:07] be able to see that uh today we are
- [02:09] launching agent kit a complete set of
- [02:11] tools for developers and enterprise to
- [02:13] build deploy and optimize agents. Okay,
- [02:16] until now building agents meant juggling
- [02:18] frame fragmented tools, complex
- [02:20] orchestration with versioning, custom
- [02:22] connectors, manual eval pipelines, there
- [02:25] were so many things. But now with the
- [02:27] help of this agent toolkit, uh agent
- [02:29] kit, uh you should be very much easy to
- [02:32] probably create the entire workflow. So
- [02:34] I was just saying agent toolkit, it
- [02:36] should be agent kit. Okay. So let me go
- [02:38] ahead and show you some kind of demo for
- [02:39] this. So I will go ahead and click on
- [02:41] open agent builder. So this is uh what
- [02:43] is the agent builder looks like. Uh here
- [02:45] you can just go ahead and do drag and
- [02:47] drop and you can actually go ahead and
- [02:49] create it. There are also some templates
- [02:51] that are available which you can
- [02:52] actually directly use it like internal
- [02:54] knowledge assistant. So let me just show
- [02:56] you this uh it may be internal knowledge
- [02:58] assistant document comparison structured
- [03:00] data planner helper customer service and
- [03:02] all. But here uh just to give you a
- [03:04] brief idea I will try to create
- [03:06] everything from scratch. So this is how
- [03:08] the agent workflow looks like. I have
- [03:11] start I have agent. So if once I click
- [03:13] on this particular agent you can see
- [03:15] that hey uh this is what my agent looks
- [03:17] like you know um here you have some kind
- [03:19] of prompts which you can give you can
- [03:20] give the model which needs to use
- [03:23] reasoning effort you can also go ahead
- [03:24] and add tools output format like how do
- [03:26] you want the output and here you still
- [03:29] have more parameters like verbosity and
- [03:31] all which you can actually play with it.
- [03:32] Okay so here uh let's say that I'm going
- [03:35] to probably go ahead and uh create a
- [03:37] basic use case. So let's say this is my
- [03:39] query classifier. So let's say that if
- [03:41] I'm saying hey write a blog on this
- [03:44] particular topic right so definitely I'm
- [03:46] saying that I really require a blog
- [03:48] right so I want to probably create a
- [03:50] blog if I go ahead and write write a
- [03:52] article on this specific topic then that
- [03:55] group should be or that classification
- [03:57] should be with respect to the article
- [03:58] right so here what I'm doing is that
- [04:00] I'll just say hey I'll give this name as
- [04:02] this agent as my query classifier I'll
- [04:04] say you are a helpful uh assistant and
- [04:07] then I will go ahead and give some kind
- [04:09] of prompt over here you need to classify
- [04:11] the query query whatever query that I'm
- [04:14] actually specifically getting as blog or
- [04:16] article right now the thing is that how
- [04:18] do I go ahead and add the context
- [04:20] because the query if I see from this
- [04:22] start button it is basically coming in
- [04:24] input
- [04:26] test so can I go ahead and ask add this
- [04:29] as a context so here you have an option
- [04:31] of adding a context you can go ahead and
- [04:33] just add this over here okay so I will
- [04:37] just go ahead and do this and I will go
- [04:38] ahead and write something like this as
- [04:40] blog or article right so I'm just saying
- [04:41] that hey you need to classify this
- [04:43] particular query that we have given
- [04:45] right as blog or article because if I
- [04:48] say hey write a blog on this particular
- [04:50] topic then automatically this should
- [04:51] happen right so this is there and I
- [04:54] think uh this is also working fine over
- [04:56] here otherwise if you don't want to go
- [04:57] ahead and write it you can also remove
- [04:59] it because since this two nodes are
- [05:01] interconnected it should work fine then
- [05:04] I have selected the model GPD5 let this
- [05:06] keep as a basic thing I don't have to
- [05:09] probably make any changes. Okay. So this
- [05:11] is my first agent that I' have actually
- [05:13] created. Now the thing is that uh from
- [05:16] this I know either I will be getting
- [05:17] blog or article. So if it is a blog I
- [05:20] need to probably go ahead and create a
- [05:21] different agent which can do that
- [05:22] specific task. So here you'll be able to
- [05:24] see in the left hand side you have lot
- [05:26] of logics kind of conditions which you
- [05:29] can apply in this right. So let's say if
- [05:31] I want to go ahead and use if else right
- [05:33] now inside this if else you know I will
- [05:35] just go ahead and write over here
- [05:37] something like query classifier. So
- [05:38] let's say this is my field name. I'm
- [05:40] providing it. I'm saying that hey inside
- [05:42] this if the input text is double equal
- [05:45] to okay if if it is double equal to blog
- [05:48] because uh sorry it should not be input
- [05:50] text it should be output text. Okay so
- [05:52] output text of this. So let me first of
- [05:54] all connect this. Okay so here what I
- [05:56] will do I will connect this to this.
- [05:58] Okay now once I connect this that
- [06:01] basically means this output is basically
- [06:02] coming over here. Now I can probably go
- [06:05] ahead and write a condition. Now what
- [06:07] condition? I will specifically write
- [06:08] over here. You just think over it. Okay.
- [06:10] Uh so do I need to probably go ahead and
- [06:13] say input? See here you can see output
- [06:16] text and input as a text. This output
- [06:18] text is basically coming from the query
- [06:20] classifier. Right? And workflow input is
- [06:22] basically coming over here. So I will go
- [06:23] ahead and put this particular condition
- [06:25] if input.output text is double equal to
- [06:28] and I'll go ahead and write blog. Right?
- [06:30] So this is a simple condition that I
- [06:31] have given over here. Right? So once I
- [06:34] write this particular condition so now
- [06:35] what I'm doing is that for this
- [06:37] particular condition I will go ahead and
- [06:38] add this particular agent and I'll
- [06:40] connect this to this. So saying that if
- [06:42] this is true then it should basically be
- [06:44] handled by this particular agent. Now
- [06:46] this agent I can go ahead and write it
- [06:47] as blog agent right and inside this I
- [06:50] can go ahead and write my own condition
- [06:52] saying that hey um you are a helpful
- [06:55] assistant let's say helpful assistant
- [06:59] okay write a detailed
- [07:04] thousand words blog
- [07:08] for the topic
- [07:10] for the topic and here I can go ahead
- [07:13] and add my own context my context text
- [07:15] will be specifically like workflow as
- [07:18] input as the text. So I can basically go
- [07:20] it go and give it over here. Right? Now
- [07:23] once I add this particular context that
- [07:24] basically means this is basically being
- [07:26] handled by blog agent itself. Right? So
- [07:28] automatically it'll be able to create a
- [07:31] thousand words blog for this particular
- [07:33] topic and this topic context is
- [07:35] basically given over here. Right? I also
- [07:37] have options that if I want to go ahead
- [07:39] and just uh if I go ahead and click on
- [07:41] the tools right I have an option saying
- [07:43] that hey do we need to probably connect
- [07:45] to any MCP server or do you want to also
- [07:48] do a web search we can also do that so
- [07:50] here I will just go ahead and click on
- [07:51] add so that basically means this agent
- [07:53] also has the access of the web search
- [07:55] right now in the else condition what
- [07:57] will happen if it is a article I will go
- [07:59] ahead and create my another agent and
- [08:01] this will be connected to this and here
- [08:03] I will go ahead and write something like
- [08:05] this this is my article agent Right now
- [08:07] inside this article agent I can again go
- [08:10] ahead and give my prompt saying that hey
- [08:12] something like this you are a helpful
- [08:14] assistant write a detailed 100,000 words
- [08:18] article for the topic and the topic is
- [08:20] basically given over here which is
- [08:21] basically coming from the input text
- [08:23] from the start right so this is what
- [08:25] from where it is basically coming so
- [08:26] this is my article agent and here also I
- [08:29] can go ahead and add any kind of tools
- [08:30] like web search and I can actually go
- [08:33] ahead and do this and here you can see
- [08:34] that my output format also I can change
- [08:36] it to something like JSON widget right
- [08:38] we'll talk more about this but here you
- [08:41] have different different um JSON outputs
- [08:43] also you can select it right so so
- [08:45] finally guys let's go ahead and uh
- [08:48] execute this uh so I'll go ahead and
- [08:50] click on preview and now I'll say write
- [08:53] me a blog on AI engineering okay now
- [08:59] let's see whether this flow will go
- [09:01] ahead so it went to the query classifier
- [09:03] I need to classify the user query it has
- [09:05] been classified I to blog. Now this blog
- [09:08] agent will definitely go ahead and
- [09:09] create the article uh or sorry the blog
- [09:12] that is required. Okay, I'm noticing
- [09:15] there is a conflict. I want to keep the
- [09:16] blog concern while aiming for the target
- [09:18] of thousand words. Uh it'll be round. So
- [09:21] this is my entire blog that is basically
- [09:23] getting created. Okay. Now similarly I
- [09:26] can also go ahead and ask for uh article
- [09:30] uh which I can also definitely use it.
- [09:32] Right. So here what I will do I will
- [09:33] quickly once this gets executed you can
- [09:35] see the entire blog has been basically
- [09:37] created. Yeah.
- [09:41] So here you have then let me go ahead
- [09:43] and write write me an article
- [09:47] for article on AI engineering. Okay the
- [09:54] same thing now you can see it went to
- [09:56] the query classifier. Now it is going to
- [09:57] classify it as article. Okay. Okay, then
- [10:00] based on the if else condition article
- [10:02] agent is basically getting called and
- [10:04] now my entire article is should be
- [10:07] displayed over here. But let's see
- [10:08] whether I have uh written the correct
- [10:11] instruction. You are a helpful
- [10:12] assistant. Write a detailed thousand
- [10:15] words article for the topic. Okay.
- [10:19] Write an article on AI engineering. So
- [10:24] you can go ahead and try out with
- [10:26] different different prompts and see that
- [10:29] you're getting thinking you're able to
- [10:31] get the output or not. Okay. So you
- [10:33] really need to play and based on this.
- [10:35] So here you can see the entire things
- [10:37] are basically coming up. So I'm I need
- [10:39] to make sure I follow the instruction to
- [10:40] classify the query telling me to write a
- [10:43] detailed blog article on AI engineering
- [10:45] which seems to conflict with the
- [10:46] classification requirement. I'm thinking
- [10:48] about instruction has high priority. The
- [10:50] system message about classification.
- [10:52] Okay. So this is what it is doing is
- [10:54] that based on this query classifier
- [10:55] right it is not able to take that
- [10:57] particular decision like blog agent okay
- [10:59] then you can go ahead and just play with
- [11:01] the prompt and write a better prompt to
- [11:03] probably you know write a detailed
- [11:05] thousandword article for the topic
- [11:07] whatever topic you're basically getting
- [11:09] um you know out out from there okay or
- [11:12] or instead of writing like this thousand
- [11:14] words and here I can go ahead and give
- [11:17] my another context my another context
- [11:20] will be something like output text
- [11:22] Right. So here 1 th00and words something
- [11:26] like this. Right now let's see write me
- [11:30] an article on AI engineering. You can go
- [11:34] ahead and play with it. Right? So
- [11:37] overall uh this way you should be able
- [11:39] to see that this entire workflow is
- [11:41] getting executed. Now uh one more
- [11:44] amazing thing about this particular
- [11:45] workflow let me just show you. Okay I
- [11:47] will close this preview. You can also go
- [11:49] ahead and publish this workflow. So
- [11:50] let's say this is my blog
- [11:54] blog or
- [11:58] article generator, right? I can go ahead
- [12:01] and publish it. Once you publish it, you
- [12:04] should be able to even see the workflow
- [12:07] ID. You can also add an allowed domain
- [12:09] to use chat chatkit. So let's say that
- [12:12] you have any domain like you can
- [12:14] actually go ahead and uh add it and
- [12:17] generate a key over there. Along with
- [12:19] that if you really want to go ahead and
- [12:21] use along with an agent SDK. So here
- [12:23] also you can see in Typescript you have
- [12:24] this code in Python you have this
- [12:27] particular code how you can actually use
- [12:28] it right and all this particular code is
- [12:31] basically given over here. Not only that
- [12:33] here also you can actually see this
- [12:34] entire information right in different
- [12:38] different language like chcript python
- [12:40] and all which you can directly use it in
- [12:42] your code and you can run this entire
- [12:44] workflow itself. Here you have the
- [12:46] workflow ID, you have agent builder,
- [12:48] each and every information, right? Along
- [12:50] with this, you also has options of MCP.
- [12:53] MCP is just like you can go ahead and
- [12:55] connect with any kind of MCP. Um, I'm
- [12:58] also developing a product where I will
- [12:59] also be developing an MCP server. Um,
- [13:02] that also I will try to add it over here
- [13:04] and see at the end of the day whatever
- [13:06] things you are actually developing can
- [13:08] be integrated as an MCP server in your
- [13:10] VS code or anywhere that you like.
- [13:11] Right? So here that option is also there
- [13:14] by OpenAI. This option is there by other
- [13:16] developers. This option is there. All
- [13:17] the things are basically there. And you
- [13:20] also have something like guardrails. Now
- [13:21] in this side the guardrails you can also
- [13:23] integrate this inside a workflow so that
- [13:26] you'll be able to apply all this
- [13:28] moderation, jailbreak, hallucination
- [13:30] condition and all right even on the LLM
- [13:32] models which will be able to do that. Uh
- [13:35] you also have this file search option
- [13:36] here. You can go ahead and create your
- [13:38] own vector store ID in the openi itself.
- [13:40] You can create it over here. You can
- [13:42] directly upload it or if you want to go
- [13:45] ahead and just create something like
- [13:46] this. You can add a files over here.
- [13:48] Automatically it'll create the vector
- [13:50] store and you can integrate that over
- [13:51] here and you can also create a rack
- [13:53] pipeline. So everything is definitely
- [13:56] possible out here over here. Um this was
- [13:59] the recent announcements and uh I think
- [14:02] it has lot of promises. So that is the
- [14:04] reason why I'm making this specific
- [14:05] video. I hope you like this particular
- [14:07] video. This was it from my side. I'll
- [14:08] see you in the next video. Thank you.
- [14:10] Take care. Bye-bye.
